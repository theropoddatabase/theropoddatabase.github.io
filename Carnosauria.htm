= Euavetheropoda Sorkin, 2015<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Bakker (1986) used the name Dinoaves in a phylogenetic
tree for a clade containing allosaurs and what are now considered
coelurosaurs, but not ceratosaurs or podokesaurs (coelophysoids). It
has not been used since and could equally well apply to Tetanurae. Paul
(1988) first used Avetheropoda as an order containing allosaurids
(including carcharodontosaurids) and all taxa now placed in
Coelurosauria, but not metriacanthosaurines (sinraptorids),
megalosauroids and more basal taxa. It was too largely ignored until
Holtz (1994) used it for an equivalent clade. Sereno proposed
Neotetanurae for the same clade that year and both names have since
received equally frequent use (e.g. 54 Google Scholar hits for
Avetheropoda vs. 56 for Neotetanurae as of 1-15-2012). Sorkin (2015)
proposed the name Euavetheropoda in an abstract, for a clade containing
<i>Monolophosaurus</i>, acrocanthosaurids, allosaurids and
coelurosaurs. It is uncertain if this is based on an analysis, and such
a clade excluding metriacanthosaurids, <i>Neovenator</i>,
carcharodontosaurines and megaraptorans has not been recovered in other
studies.<br>
Sereno's newest (in press) definition of Neotetanurae differs from the
original (Sereno, 1998) by adding <i>Sinraptor</i> and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
as internal specifiers. I suppose it would preserve content better if
sinraptorids or carcharodontosaurids end up just basal to carnosaurs +
coelurosaurs (Paul, 1988; Coria and Salgado, 1995; Longrich, 2001;
Paul, 2002). However, if carcharodontosaurids are ceratosaurs
(Bonaparte et al., 1990) or sinraptorids are megalosaurids (Kurzanov,
1989), the original intent of Neotetanurae would be lost. The latter
two situations seem less likely than the former, so Sereno's
redefinition may be more advantageous than not.<br>
While found in nearly every analysis, recent work suggests Avetheropoda
as currently conceived may not exist, with megalosauroids actually
being carnosaurs so that Avetheropoda includes the current content of
Orionides. This can be found in Rauhut (2003) and Cau's unpublished
work, while Carrano et al. (2012) find it in their trees with only two
more steps.<br>

<b>Aptian?, Early Cretaceous<br>
Xinlong Formation, Guangxi, China</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (GMG 00001) (adult) partial thirteenth dorsal vertebra
(~130 mm), incomplete synsacrum (94, 78, 93, 113, 106 mm), incomplete
first caudal vertebra (~96 mm), incomplete second caudal vertebra,
incomplete first chevron, incomplete ilium (~700 mm), pubic fragment,
proximal ischium<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Mo et al., 2014) thirteenth dorsal vertebra
with teardrop-shaped foramen bordered by centrum, anterior
centroparapophyseal and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae;
thirteenth dorsal vertebra with well developed horizontal
prezygoparapophyseal lamina; thirteenth dorsal vertebra with
parapophysis projecting further laterally than diapophysis; brevis
fossa shallow with short, ridge-like medial blade; iliac pubic peduncle
with posteroventrally expanded margin.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2011. Mo et al. (2014)
included it in Carrano et al.'s tetanurine analysis and found it to be
a carcharodontosaurid outside Megaraptora and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>+<i>Shaochilong</i>+Carcharodontosaurinae.
Cau (online, 2014) noted this analysis only includes a few
coelurosaurs, and found that <i>Datanglong</i> emerges as a
compsognathid-grade coelurosaur. If more coelurosaurs are added to the
Carrano tetanurine dataset, I find both positions to be equally
parsimonious. It is thus retained as Avetheropoda incertae sedis here
pending further study.  Samathi and Chanthasit (2017) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Datanglong</span> as a megaraptoran using
Novas et al.'s tetanurine analysis, "sharing the pneumaticity of the
ilium with other megaraptorans."<br>

<b>Late Kimmeridgian-Early Tithonian, Late Jurassic<br>
Sobral Formation, Portugal</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (ML 370) (4 m) cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae,
sacral vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, chevrons, ilia, partial pubes,
partial ischia, partial femora, tibia, fibula, proximal metatarsal, 32
gastroliths<br>
<b>Referred</b>- (ML 565) adult teeth, ~300 embryonic elements
including maxilla, four teeth, vertebrae, scapulae, ilium, femora,
tibiae and metatarsi, ~100 eggs, nest (Mateus, 1997)<br>
(ML 1194) eggshells (Ribeiro et al., 2013)<br>
distal caudal vertebra (Mateus, pers. comm, 2002)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Mateus, 1998) all vertebral centra are longer
than tall; proximal caudal neural spines with well-developed spike-like
anterior process; pubic blade perforated by large vertical ellipsoidal
foramen; anterior trochanter well separated from the main body axis of
the femur in lateral view.<br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) medial condyle of tibia half the
transverse width of fibular condyle.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The specimen had 32 gastroliths and the enveloping
sediment preserved the negative imprint of 3 additional gastroliths.
The maximum observed gastrolith length is 22 millimetres. Near the
pebbles there were three small bone fragments that seem to be food
remains. The gastroliths have been found in the rib cage below the
eleventh dorsal vertebra. The high number, concentration and relative
size of the gastroliths suggest that they belong to this specimen, and
that they had not been swallowed when eating other dinosaur's stomach.
Mateus (pers. comm., 2002) refers one distal caudal previously referred
to <i>Megalosaurus insignis</i> (Lapparent and Zbyszewski, 1957) to <i>Lourinhanosaurus</i>. 
Antunes and Mateus (2003) referred "a femur (ML 555) at Porto das
Barcas" to the taxon, but Malafaia et al. (2020) later stated it "does
not share any diagnostic characters with the holotype; ML 555 has a
femoral head that projects dorsomedially, which is a feature that has
been interpreted as a synapomorphy of Carcharodontosauria."  It is
here provisionally referred to contemporaneous carcahrodontosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Lusovenator</span>.<br>
Eggshells belong to <i>Preprismatoolithus</i>.<br>
<b>Phylogenetic relationships</b>- Though Mateus (1998) originally
referred this taxon to Allosauroidea and Holtz et al. (2004) later
found it to be a carnosaur, Allain (2001) recovered it as a
megalosaurid in his unpublished analysis while Mateus et al. (2006)
refer it to Eustreptospondylidae without explanation. Benson (2008,
2010) found it to be a sinraptorid, and in a more extensive analysis
(Benson et al., 2010) placed it sister to <i>Streptospondylus</i>
in that clade. Carrano et al. (2012) later found it to be a basal
coelurosaur, though only two more steps were needed to make it a basal
carnosaur or sister to Avetheropoda, so neither option is
unlikely. 
Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as intermediate between
megalosauroids and sinraptorids, so a position close to the base of
Avetheropoda is advocated here.  Most recently, Rauhut et al.
(2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix to recover it
as either a basal megalosaurid, a eustreptospondyline or sister to
Allosauria.<br>

<b>Valanginain-Barremian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Jingxing (=Chingshong) Formation, Yunnan, China</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (IVPP coll.) partial tooth (FABL ~32 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Ye (often cited as Yeh) first mentioned <i>Tyrannosaurus
lanpingensis</i> in 1975 as a new species from the IVPP that had not
been published. Zhao (1986) provides a photo of the basal half of a
tooth, crediting the name <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> "lanpingi" to himself
(as Chao). In the plate's caption, he lists it as being from the Early
Cretaceous Jingxing Formation of Lanping, Yunnan. Azuma (1991) listed "<i>Tarbosaurus
lanpinensis</i>(?)" as a tyrannosaurid from the Tugulu Group of China,
citing Dong (1992, which was in press at the time). Dong (1992)
discusses it as <i>Tyrannosaurus lanpingensis</i>, mistakenly
attributing the name to Zhao, 1983. In Appendix A, Dong lists it as a
tyrannosaurid named <i>Tarbosaurus</i> (<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>) <i>lanpinensis</i>
(no doubt a misspelling, which Azuma's was based on), and mistakenly
attributes it to Chao, 1975. In Appendix C, it is <i>Tarbosaurus</i> (<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>)
<i>lanpingensis</i>. Dong states it is from the Chingshong Formation of
Lanping County in Yunnan, which he attributes to Tithonian-Neocomian
age based on bivalves. He says the species is based on a single tooth
without diagnosis or drawing, so is a nomen nudum, but Zhao (1986) did
illustrate it. Ford and Chure misspelled it as <i>Tyrannosaurus
langingi</i>, credited to Zhao (1986), in an unpublished list based on
their 2001 SVP abstract. They have it as from the Upper Chingshing
Formation, which they attribute to Berriasian-Hauterivian. Hurum and
Sabath (2003) list <i>"Tyrannosaurus lanpingensis"</i> as a
tyrannosaurid, citing Ye. Azuma et al. (2006) lists <i>"Tyrannosaurus"
lanpingensis</i> from the Chingshong Formation. The formation is almost
always called the Jingxing Formation, and is agreed by modern
paleontologists to be Valanginian-Barremian (e.g. Sha, 2010).<br>
The photo is the basal half of a tooth crown in labial view, and has a
FABL of ~32 mm. Only distal serrations are evident, which are small (8
per 5 mm) and have apically angled blood grooves. The size and
serration density fall within the range of <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>,
but also <i>Carcharodontosaurus saharicus</i>. Angled blood grooves
are known for tyrannosaurids and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>, but also
taxa like <i>Fukuiraptor</i>. Importantly, there seem to be prominent
enamel wrinkles along the distal carina. These are almost never found
in tyrannosauroids, but are known in derived carcharodontosaurids, <i>Allosaurus</i>
and <i>Fukuiraptor</i>. As "lanpingensis" is from the Early
Cretaceous, it's more likely to be a megaraptoran or
carcharodontosaurid than an allosaurid or tyrannosaurine. Both are
clades known from large taxa (<i>Chilantaisaurus</i>; <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>,
<i>Giganotosaurus</i>, <i>Mapusaurus</i>) and both are known from Asia
(<i>Chilantaisaurus</i>, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>; <i>Shaochilong</i>).
Until more details are known, I recommend placing "lanpingensis" in
Avetheropoda indet..<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (PVL 3670-11) ilial fragment, pubis (514 mm)<br>
<b>Description</b>- Novas and Agnolin (2004) determined the supposedly
diagnostic proximal sulcus noted by Powel (1979) doesn't exist, and is
actually the pubic peduncle of the ilium broken and displaced. This
allowed them to identify a ventrally concave pubic peduncle, and the
angle between the anterior and ventral edges supports opisthopuby.
What's normally seen as the acetabular surface of the pubis is the
posterior part of a very long ilial peduncle, leaving a very tiny space
for the acetabulum, which is said to resemble maniraptoriformes. These
characters support placement in Maniraptora.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- While the family Unquillosauridae was apparently named
by Powell in his thesis, the ICZN does not accept theses as valid for
nomenclatural purposes, so it is a nomen nudum.<br>
In 1997, Ford suggested on the DML that <i>Unquillosauru</i>s was
similar to <i>Unenlagia</i>, which has gone so far as to prompt
discussion of synonymy. However, <i>Unquillosaurus</i> is not
synonymous with <i>Unenlagia</i>. First, I should note the pubis was
described incorrectly, the medial side being lateral and vice versa (as
later determined by Carrano et al., 2012). The supposed "lateral crest"
is really the pubic apron, the "lateral" facets on the pubic boot are
really for the pubic symphysis. Compared to <i>Unenlagia</i>- the
pubis is more propubic; the ischial peduncle is longer; there was an
obturator notch; the shaft is anteroposteriorly thicker distally; the
pubic boot projects slightly anteriorly; there is a proximomedial
sulcus; the ilial peduncle is less transversly expanded; the pelvic
canal is narrower; the proximal shaft expands laterally; the distal end
is expanded transversely, not compressed; there is a gap in the
symphysis proximal to the pubic boot. Also keep in mind <i>Unquillosaurus</i>
is from the Los Blanquitos Formation, while <i>Unenlagia</i> is from
the Rio Neuquén Formation.<br>
Novas and Agnolin (2004) keep Powell's orientation, remarking on the
"prominent external longitudinal ridge" (=pubic apron?), odd medially
convex pelvic canal margins (concave if reversed) and lack of an apron
or medial symphysis. In addition, the medial end is described as
"flattened and lacks marks for the articulation with the opposite
bone". I see no reason to doubt the hypothesis they have the pubis
reversed. <br>
Novas and Agnolin refer to Maniraptora, while Carrano et al. suggest it
is a carcharodontosaurid. It is at least an avetheropod due to lacking
an obturator foramen. <br>

carcharodontosaurian based on the more vertical pubic peduncle

ventrally projecting pubic peduncle is shared with almost all
averostrans in their matrix. When entered into Carrano et al.'s matrix,

<b>Comments</b>- Pol and Rauhut (2012) originally noted this as a
large partially articulated basal tetanurine. Rauhut and Diego (2012)
in an abstract reported the mix of characters supporting and arguing
against assignment to Tetanurae, Megalosauroidea and Carnosauria, with
a suggestion this could indicate carnosaurian megalosauroids or high
amounts of homoplasy. Rauhut and Pol (2019) named and described the
taxon, but this paper has no mention of ZooBank and as of January 23
2020
"Asfaltovenator" lacks an entry on the ZooBank webite.  Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Asfaltovenator vialidadi"
Rauhut and Pol, 2019 is a nomen nudum that may never be technically
valid
as its journal is not published physically.<br>
Rauhut and Pol added "Asfaltovenator" to Carrano et al.'s tetanurine
analysis and recovered it sister to allosauroids in Carnosauria, with
piatnitzkysaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Xuanhanosaurus</span>,
megalosaurids, spinosaurids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Monolophosaurus</span>
successively more basal non-allosauroid carnosaurs.  Forcing
"Asfaltovenator" in Megalosauroidea takes 4 steps.  Moreecently,
Rauhut et al. (2024) used
the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix to recover it as either a
basal megalosauroid, basal allosaurian or an allosaurid. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Barrois (1875) and Sauvage (1876) described a tooth
from Louppy-le-Chateau and other remains (two teeth and a centrum from
Grandpre) as <i>Megalosaurus</i>. Sauvage (1882a) later briefly
described a partial skeleton which is the type of his new species <i>Megalosaurus
superbus</i>, associated with a larger distal femur. He described the
skeleton, distal femur and other remains later that year (1882b),
believing the previously known teeth from Louppy and Grandpre to come
from the same species. Huene (1923; and later in 1926a, b) separated it
from <i>Megalosaurus</i> as the new genus <i>Erectopus superbus</i>.
Sauvage did not designate any material as a holotype, and it is not
certain it all derives from one individual. In particular, the larger
distal femur was found in the same area, and the teeth were discovered
before the partial skeleton in a potentially different area. Huene
(1932) incorrectly believed Sauvage based the name <i>superbus</i> on
the original teeth, and as he thought these were too large to go with
the postcrania, he separated the latter as <i>Erectopus sauvagei</i>.
However, there is no evidence Sauvage intended to base <i>superbus</i>
on the teeth, and the fact he waited until describing the postcrania in
1882 to name the species suggests the opposite. Furthermore, Allain
(2005) correctly notes the original teeth match the preserved maxillary
teeth in size. Huene retained the teeth as gen. indet. <i>superbus</i>,
which he believed was an allosaurid in contrast to <i>Erectopus</i>,
which he placed in a monotypic new family. Allain made the maxillary
fragment the lectotype of <i>Erectopus superbus</i>, as the rest of
the material is lost (though some elements are preserved as casts to
form a plastotype). As the tooth matches that on the lectotype, and the
rest of the specimen is no more certainly associated than the maxilla
and tooth are with it, there is no reason to separate the tooth from
the postcrania taxonomically. Notably, the ICZN does not allow a
species to lack a genus, and the genus <i>Erectopus</i> must be
attached to the species <i>superbus</i> based on Huene (1923),
regardless which elements each name is based on. <i>Erectopus sauvagei</i>
is thus an objective junior synonym of <i>Erectopus superbus</i>.&nbsp;Note contra the Paleobiology Database (online 2006), Deperet and Savornin (1927) made <em>superbus</em> a species of their <em>Megalosaurus</em> subgenus <em>Dryptosaurus</em>, not a species of the genus <em>Dryptosaurus</em>.<br>
Several elements have been reidentified since Sauvage's (1882a, b)
description. The posterior mandible is an anterior maxilla (Allain,
2005).The clavicle was reidentified as a scapula (Huene, 1926a, b), but
is a partial ilium (Chure, 2000). The "inferior" (=proximal?) radius is
a distal tibia (Huene, 1926a, b). Huene (1926a, b) identified two
supposed proximal metacarpals as a distal radius and ulna, though as
these were never illustrated this is uncertain. Manual digits II-IV are
I-III, and phalanges II-2 and II-3 are actually just I-2 (the ungual).
Similarly, phalanges III-3 and III-4 are just II-3 (the ungual). The
supposed manual phalanx III-1 of Sauvage and Chure (?-1 of Huene) is
more probably the other phalanx I-1 as it is too long for III-1, and
too broad for digit III. Sauvage identified an element as the
lateralmost metacarpal, which would be V in his reconstruction, but
which is probably IV (considered a lateral manual phalanx by Chure,
2000). The questionably referred manual phalanx of Sauvage and pedal
phalanx I-1 of Huene is metacarpal I (Molnar, 1990). The distal fibulae
are proximal fibulae (Huene, 1926a, b). <br>
<b>Not <i>Erectopus</i></b>- Several other European remains have been
referred to <i>Erectopus</i> or <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i> in the
past. Sauvage (1882b) thought the tooth from Louppy and two teeth from
Grandpre described by Barrois (1875) and Sauvage (1876) belonged to his
new species <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>. A distal metatarsal and a
proximal metapodial from Grandpre were also described, the latter of
which Huene (1926a, b) believed was a distal fibula. Sauvage also
referred a much larger distal femur from Louppy to <i>Megalosaurus
superbus</i>, though Huene (1926a, b) believed it to derive from a
different taxon. Also figured by Sauvage is a large pedal phalanx from
Bar-le-Duc, while he mentions another large pedal phalanx from an
unstated locality. <br>
Simionescu (1913) compared a tooth (UAIC (SCM1) 615) from the
Valanginian Cernavoda Formation of Romania to <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>.
Huene (1926) doubted it was the same species due to age differences,
but did continue to call it <i>Erectopus</i> aff. <i>superbus</i>. It
was recently redescribed by Csiki-Sava et al. (2016) as a
carcharodontosaurine. <br>
Huene (1926a) referred a centrum from Grandpre described as <i>Megalosaurus</i>
by Sauvage (1876) to <i>Erectopus superbus</i>. Similarly, he referred
a distal femur from Blacourt described as dinosaurian by Sauvage (1876)
to <i>E. superbus</i>, but Chure (2000) determined it is crocodilian.<br>
Stromer (1934) referred a proximal tibia, distal femur and distal tibia
(IPHG 1912 VIII 78, 85 and 190) from the Cenomanian Baharija Formation
of Egypt to aff. <i>Erectopus superbus</i>, but none are similar to
that genus.<br>
Lapparent and Zbyszewski (1957) referred two tooth fragments from the
Aptian of Portugal to <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>, but these are
undiagnostic.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Allain (2002a, b) found <i>Erectopus</i> to
emerge as a carnosaur in an unpublished phylogenetic analysis based on
his thesis, which was also the conclusion of his 2005 redescription of
the material. This was based solely on the interpretation of the distal
tibia as indicating a well developed posterior astragalar ascending
process. However, a similar morphology is also seen in the tibia of <i>Poekilopleuron</i>,
which lacks a posterior ascending process. Carrano et al. (2012)
suggest <i>Erectopus</i> is a non-carcharodontosaurid allosauroid,
possibly a metriacanthosaurid, though they did not include it in their
analysis. When it is added to the matrix, it emerges as a
non-allosaurian carnosaur, and indeed can be a metriacanthosaurid. Note
if it is a metriacanthosaurid, Erectopodidae would have priority as the
family name.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Generally viewed as an indeterminate theropod,
Brusatte et al. (2010) report <i>Kelmayisaurus</i> is diagnostic and
shares characters with megalosauroids, carcharodontosaurids and
megaraptorans. They redescribed it the following year as a basal
carcharodontosaurid more derived than <i>Neovenator</i> but less than <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
and more derived taxa, but only one more step was necessary to place it
as a more basal carcharodontosaurid, megalosaurine or basal
coelurosaur. Adding it to the matrix of Caranno et al. (2012) results
in a less resolved placement however, as an allosaurian excluded from
Megaraptora and carcharodontosaurids as derived as <i>Eocarcharia</i>.
Moving it to Megalosauroidea or Coelurosauria still requires only a
single additional step, so either relationship is about equally
probable.<br>
Dong (1992) mentioned two referred specimens. One is from the Ejinhoro
Formation and may be possible to refer to <i>Kelmayisaurus</i> as the
holotype also includes a dentary. The other is a pair of distal pubes
from the same locality as the holotype, but cannot be compared with the
latter.<br>

Benson (2008, 2010) and Holtz et al. (2004) recovered <i>Xuanhanosaurus</i>
as a non-orionidan tetanurine, and Rauhut (2000) also found it to be a
non-coelurosaur tetanurine. Benson found it to be sister to
Piatnitzkysauridae, but this was poorly supported. More recently,
Carrano et al. (2012) recovered the genus as a metriacanthosaurid
outside <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i> and the derived metriacanthosaurine
clade (<i>Sinraptor</i>, <i>Siamotyrannus</i> and <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>).
Yet when their analysis is properly ordered, it has a less exact
position as a carnosaur outside <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>,
the derived metriacanthosaurine clade and Allosauria. In Carrano et
al.'s matrix, it moves to Piatnitzkysauridae with only one more step,
and outside Orionides with only three more steps, so no suggested
position is well supported.  Rauhut et al. (2024) note that "The
most similar morphology [to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alpkarakush</span>]
is found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Xuanhanosaurus</span>
(IVPP V 6729), which also has well-developed medial and lateral
tubercles on the proximal end of the ventral side of phalanx II-1, in
which, however, the ventral sulcus is less enclosed" and suggested "The
marked similarities between manual phalanx II-1 in <span style="font-style: italic;">Xuanhanosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alpkarakush</span>
might lend support to a metriacanthosaurid identification of the
former."  They recovered it using the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group
Theropod Matrix as a piatnitzkysaurid or metriacanthosaurid.<br>

(UMNH VP coll.) several partial teeth, ilium(?) (DeCourten, 1990)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered between the Summers of 1987 and 1989,
DeCourten (1990) originally reported "Two nearly complete large teeth
(along with some smaller fragments) that belong to an entirely
different dinosaur have been discovered. As much as 12 cm (4') in size
with jagged serrated edges, these teeth are those of a large
carnivorous dinosaur."  He stated "it is not possible to identify
the owner of the teeth with precision, but a good candidate seems to be
a dinosaur like <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>,"
... which lived "in Texas about the same time the Long Walk Quarry
sediments were deposited in Utah, was about the same size, and almost
certainly had teeth of the same general form. For now, we can only
refer to this dinosaur as<span style="font-style: italic;">
Acrocanthosaurus(?)</span>." 
DeCourten furthermore said "An ilium (hip blade) has also been
excavated that definitely belongs to a carnivorous dinosaur ... , but
it is far too small to belong to the<span style="font-style: italic;">
Acrocanthosaurus(?)</span>."  Finally, DeCourten figures "A large
tooth from a carnivorous dinosaur, probably similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocantosaurus</span> [sic], from the
Long Walk Quarry. This tooth is over 4 inches long..."<br>
Two very similar publications followed (DeCourten, 1991a, b), with the
shorter one somewhat arbitrarily designated 1991a here since no order
of publication is obvious.  DeCourten (1991a) says "several teeth
of a large carnosaur have been recovered from the Long Walk Quarry. The
dagger-like serrated teeth (fig. 5) are about 4 in. (12 cm) long and
slightly elliptical in cross-section. These appear to be the anterior
teeth of a large predator similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>",
with the same taxonomic conclusions as in 1990.  A photo of the
same tooth is now labeled "Large carnosaur tooth from the Long Walk
Quarry. The tooth is more than 4 in. (10 cm) long and probably
represents a theropod similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>". 
DeCourten (1991b) says "two nearly complete teeth, several partial
teeth, and an ilium presently undergoing preparation document the
presence at the Long Walk Quarry of at least one large theropod
dinosaur. The teeth are of the typical dagger-like theropod form, with
serrated edges and a curved anterior margin (Figure 7). The two
complete teeth are 3.3 inches (84mm) and 3.9 inches<br>
(99mm) long, comparable in size to the average tooth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>..." 
Differently from the 1990 publication however is his statement "The
ilium is at least 16 inches (40cm) long and appears to belong to a
bipedal predator of about average <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
size as well", so it is no longer considered too small to belong to the
tooth taxon at this point.  The same tooth photo is now labeled
"Large theropod tooth (UMNH VP4805) from the Long Walk Quarry" but has
a scale bar for the first time.  This indicates a length of ~76
mm, so is apparently the shorter tooth mentioned, but this is also the
total length of which ~32% is root.  Based on the figure the crown
height would be ~52 mm instead, but the crown height of the other tooth
is now of course uncertain.<br>
Kirkland et al. (1997) say "Kirkland and Parrish (1995) suggested that
the teeth of the Long Walk Quarry theropod are distinct from <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> in that they are
much more coarsely serrated", but as the latter meeting abstract only
says that "cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>"
is part of the middle (Ruby Ranch) fauna perhaps this detail was only
in the associated poster.  Kirkland et al. themselves state "an
unidentified large theropod, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>"
are present, listing under "Family Allosauridae ?" "new large theropod"
and "cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
sp." in their Table 2, implying some <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
was present after all.  As Harris (1998) explained "this is in
reference to an isolated tooth (CEU 5107) with very fine serrations
from the Cedar Mountain Formation near the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur
Quarry (J. Kirkland, personal comm., 1998)", which  is from the
Price River 3 locality
higher in the formation.<br>
Harris (1998) further says "DeCourten (1991: fig. 5) illustrates a
tooth (UUVP 904) from the Long Walk Quarry in the Cedar Mountain
Formation (Ruby Ranch Member per Kirkland et al., 1997) of Utah
attributed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
or a similar taxon", referring to what I call DeCourten
1991a.  <font size="2"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
Levitt-Bussian (pers. comm. 7-2024) clarified </span></font>UMNH
VP 904 is a Long Walk Quarry theropod tooth, so apparently Harris
accidentally used the number with their older UUVP catalog
system.  This indicates it is probably DeCourten's second complete
tooth and Harris was wrong to cite the latter's figure for it.  He
continues
"Examination of this specimen indicates that it differs from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
tooth described by Harris (1997, 1998) in possessing approximately 1
denticle per mm, as opposed to 2 per mm in the Trinity taxon's tooth.
However, precise measurements could not be taken, and examination of
the specimen was impaired by incomplete preparation between the
denticles."  DeCourten's (1991b) scale bar suggests 6.3 serrations
per 5 mm at midheight distally, a more commonly used unit of serration
density today.  This is indeed much less than the 11.5-17.5 per 5
mm in verified <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
teeth.  Finally, Harris notes "The association of the ilium in the
same quarry as the teeth may indicate that they originated from the
same taxon, if not the same individual. As no ilium of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
has yet been described, it is impossible to determine if the specimen
represents the Trinity taxon, the taxon represented in the quarry by
the coarsely-serrated teeth, or a different large theropod."  Over
twenty-five years later, the ilium of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
remains unknown, but the Long Walk material is all provisionally
assigned to the same unnamed taxon here since Ruby Ranch <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
is from a higher level and different locality, all three teeth with
published serration densities have similar values, and DeCourten 1991b
indicated the teeth and ilium were compatible in size.  However,
Irmis (pers. comm. 7-2024) reported "I'm pretty sure the ilium turned
out not to be a theropod", so its true identity is yet again uncertain.<br>
Kirkland et al. (2016) note that of the Long Walk elements, "a large
allosaurid [is] noted among the material (figure 29)", with Figure 29B
being labeled "Allosauroid tooth from Long Walk Quarry (UMNH 0002)" and
listed as "large allosauroid".  They had earlier cited "the Long
Walk Quarry (UMNH 0002)", showing that to be the locality number not
the specimen number.  The figured tooth seems to be mesial, from
either the right dentary or left premaxilla based on the labially
shifted distal carina.  At ~90 mm long including the root it
doesn't match either measurement reported by DeCourten (1991b), but is
the same ratio shorter than the longer measurement (90%) as UMNH VP4805
was from the shorter measurement.  The much higher specimen number
suggests it is not one of the originally reported teeth, however.<br>
Oswald and Curtice's (2023) SVP poster incorporated two 'Long Walk
Allosaur' teeth- the one figured by Kirkland et al. now identified as
UMNH VP 26019, and other without a root labeled as UMNH VP 26018. 
They provide serration measurements of these teeth as 7 mesial per 5 mm
and 7-9 distal per 5 mm.  <br>

Material</b>- (IVPP coll.) humerus (283 mm), radius, ulna (237 mm),
metacarpal I, phalanx I-1, manual ungual I (130 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Zhao and Xu report this specimen has well developed
humeral internal and outer tuberosities; well developed entepicondyle;
greatly expanded deltopectoral crest; ectocondyle more expanded than
entocondyle; high ulnohumeral ratio of 84%; ulna slightly curved;
smooth surface on the top of the well developed olecranon process; well
developed biceps tubercle on the radius; sub-rhombic distal end of
radius; manual ungual I 46% of humeral length. They say preliminary
analysis suggests it may be carnosaurian though it shares some
characters with coelurosaurs. The basal tyrannosauroid <i>Yutyrannus</i>
was later described from this formation and is of similar size with a
similar ungual/humeral ratio, but lacks an entepicondyle, has a larger
entocondyle than ectocondyle, and a shorter ulna (~73% of humeral
length) which is straight. Thus it seems unlikely Zhao and Xu's
specimen is an early <i>Yutyrannus</i> record.<br>

Material-</b> (MNN GAD1; holotype of <i>Kryptops palaios</i> in part)
(~6-7 m; adult) fragmentary anterior dorsal vertebra (~70 mm), two
partial mid dorsal vertebrae, two ribs (~500-600 mm), sacrum
(?,?,?,110,110 mm), ilia (650 mm), pubes (~620 mm), ischia (~580 mm) <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was described as part of the holotype of the
abelisaur <i>Kryptops</i> by Sereno and Brusatte (2008). The
postcrania were in situ, while the maxilla was loose on the surface 15
meters away. Furthermore, Carrano et al. (2012) noted the postcrania
are too primitive for an abelisaur, suggesting they do not belong
together. They believed a a subrectangular fenestra between the fourth
and fifth sacral neural spines as in <i>Giganotosaurus</i> and a
peg-and-socket ilioischial articulation indicated the postcrania were
carcharodontosaurid, probably the contemporaneous <i>Eocarcharia</i>.
Cau (online, 2012) ran the postcrania as a separate OTU and found them
to clade with <i>Siamotyrannus</i> in Metriacanthosaurinae. They are
retained here as Allosauroidea incertae sedis.<br>

it remains informal.  Notably even if <span style="font-style: italic;">Metriacanthosaurus</span>

even if <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span> is a

<i6cryolophosaurus ellioti=""><i6cryolophosaurus ellioti=""> Brusatte
and Sereno's (2008) definition of Sinraptoridae differs from Holtz et

which I view as superfluous, since a (<i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
(<i>Sinraptor</i>, <i>Passer</i>)) topology has never been advocated. <i>Megalosaurus</i>
might be a better choice for a tertiary external specifier, to cover
traditional phylogenies prior to 1993.<br>
In several phylogenies prior to 1994, metriacanthosaurids such as <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>
were seen as outside Avetheropoda. While not seen in many recent
analyses, this only takes five more steps when constrained in Carrano

with- "Teeth thick and sharply pointed with fine palisade
denticulations on both sides. The anterior which are finer than the
posterior ones push lingually<br>
towards the base and form a ridge topping at a distance before the base
of the tooth."<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The material was discovered in late Spring 1941, with the type
consisting of four isolated teeth IVPP V237A-D.  Young's (1942)
diagnosis was "Mainly based upon" the largest tooth (V237A), with the
three smaller teeth considered immature and (possibly incorrectly)
lacking their bases.  He stated "The general shape of the teeth
resembles that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus
stechowi</span>" which was prescient as both are based on mesial
dentition, and considered <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
a ceratosaurid based on the questionably referred postcrania. 
Ironically, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Labrosaurus" stechowi</span>
is now thought to be ceratosaurid, but as Young noted <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> lacks its lingual
fluting which has proven to be a ceratosaurid character. 
Subsequently, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
was generally placed in Megalosauridae (e.g. Romer, 1956; Steel, 1970;
Dong et al., 1978) when it was used as a waste basket for almost all
large Jurassic theropods including <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>
and later <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>. 
Note Huene (1959) when citing <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
as named in 1958 from the Late Cretaceous of Shantung meant to list <span style="font-style: italic;">Chingkankousaurus</span>.  Dong et
al.
(1983) reported that "Rozhdestvensky (1964) proposed that the four
teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> could
possibly belong to the Crocodilia" (translated), but which work this
corresponds to was not listed in the bibliography and cannot be
determined.  Dong et al.
also stated "during the editing of "The Handbook of Chinese Fossil
Vertebrates," Zhiming Dong conducted a review of these four specimens
and formally confirmed that the best preserved tooth among the V237
collection was a premaxillary tooth of a carnosaurian dinosaur, but
that the remaining three teeth were assignable to the crocodile <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>."  The dentition
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
has not been described or figured in enough detail to distinguish it
from theropods, but two of the teeth (IVPP V237B and V237D)
are similar in being short and barely recurved with a high crown base
ratio, characters shared with the tooth figured separately in
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>' type
description.  They are provisionally placed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span> sp. here.  The
third supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
tooth (IVPP V237C) is different in having a distinctly D-shaped section
with strong carinae somewhat like Guimarota tyrannosauroid premaxillary
tooth IPFUB GUI D 89, so is provisionally placed in Tyrannosauroidea
here.  Retaining only one of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>'
syntype teeth in the genus would make it the lectotype, and as ICZN
Article 74.5 states "In a lectotype designation made before 2000,
either the term "lectotype", or an exact translation or equivalent
expression (e.g. "the type"), must have been used or the author must
have unambiguously selected a particular syntype to act as the unique
name-bearing type of the taxon", and Dong et al. explicitly make <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> a synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>, and of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>'
syntypes only consider IVPP V237A to be theropodan, this is here
considered a valid lectotype designation.  Rozhdestveksy (1977)
earlier
listed <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus ceratosauroides</span>
as "synonyms?" in his Table 1 without comment, while Dong et al.'s
synonymization was based on examining <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>
teeth from CV 00214 to correctly determine "the differences among
carnosaur dentitions are due only to being in a different position in
the dentition" and noting <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>'
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>'
types are from the same locality.  While this indeed makes it
possible
they even derive from the same individual, none of the teeth have been
shown to be diagnostic within metriacanthosaurids, and synonymization
should be based on autapomorphies or unique combinations of characters
instead of provenance.  This synonymization of part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> type with <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>
was followed by Molnar et al. (1990) where they consider the taxon an
allosaurid, which makes sense as Dong was a coauthor.  Most
recently,
Hendrickx et al. included <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
in their cluster analyses, although the taxon is never mentioned in the
text, matrices or table of examined taxa.  Classical/Hierarchical
clustering resolves it with <span style="font-style: italic;">Genyodectes</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span> (the only
metriacanthosaurid analyzed there) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>, while neighbour joining
clustering resolves it sister to a clade whose basal members are '<span style="font-style: italic;">Indosuchus</span>' AMNH jaws, <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span>.  <br>
Young placed locality 47 at "the top part of the Kuangyuan Series and
immediately below the Chentsianyen conglomerate", now known as the
Guangyuan Group and the Chengqiangyan Group, with the former
corresponding to the Xiashaximiao Formation through the Penglaizhen
Formation.  As it was found "immediately below" the boundary
(layer 8b in Young et al., 1943), <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
may be from the Penglaizhen Formation or slightly lower Shuining
Formation.  The age is listed as Tithonian on fossilworks and in
Weishampel (1990), the latter cited as from "Dong (pers. comm.)". 
Geographically, locality 47 is "the hill slopes under the so-called
Chentsianyen escarpment S. of the Kuangyuan city", now known as
Guangyuan.<br>
The tooth is similar to many large theropod teeth in general
characters, but is from the premaxilla as evidenced by the twisted
mesial carina and reduced extent of mesial serrations. The crown
base ratio (.75) is between the third and fourth premaxillary teeth of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span>'s holotype
(pm3 .60; pm4 1.04), which also match in size (pm3 FABL 16.87 mm; pm4
BW 12.26 mm) and in lacking mesial serrations basally.  The cited
mesial (15 per 5 mm) and distal (6.7-10 per 5 mm) serration densities
are matched by teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span>,
and the strong mesial carina Young describes could easily be due to the
"longitudinal groove adjacent to the mesial carina, on the lingual
surface of the crown" "clearly present in lpm3 and lpm4" as described
by Hendrickx et al. (2020) for <span style="font-style: italic;">S.
dongi</span>.  Thus <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
is indistinguishable from <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor
dongi</span>
as far as can be determined from the description, and given its poorly
constrained age could be contemporaneous or even synonymous. 
Hendrickx
et al.'s matrices show no differences between <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis</span>
(including <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. magnus</span>), <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">S. hepingensis</span> that can be
evaluated for <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>,
so pending Hendrickx's in prep. study on metriacanthosaurid dental
anatomy the genus is considered Metriacanthosauridae indet..<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Referred material</span>- Young (1942)
figured and described an ulna from the type locality (IVPP V193),
stating he "would prefer to refer this ulna to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus ceratosauroides</span> above
described."  The element is very different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Limusaurus</span>
in having marked transverse expansions proximally and distally as well
as a triangular versus reniform proximal end, so that if <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinocoelurus</span> is closely related to
that genus the ulna is unlikely to belong to it.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoabelisaurus</span> has a much longer
olecranon.  The ulnae of megalosaurids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Kaijiangosaurus</span> are far more robust
with more proximally extended olecranons, while those of most
coelurosaurs (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Zuolong</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>) are much more slender
with developed olecranons as well.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span>
has a dissimilar ulna with a strong olecranon, prominent anteroproximal
longitudinal ridge and unexpanded distal end.  This leaves several
roughly comparable taxa whose ulnae have been figured in
anteroposterior view- <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Poekilopleuron</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>.  Young compared
it favorably to the former, writing "it fits rather well with the ulna
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus nasicornis</span>
(length of ulna, 17.7 cm.) which is only slightly longer than the
present form", and indeed the main difference in profile is the more
gradual proximal expansion laterally.  However, in proximal view
IVPP
V193 differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>
and most other proximally figured ulnae in having a centrally placed
olecranon (also seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>,
but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>). 
While only photographed in anterior view, the ulna of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span> (CV 00214) would
also seem to have a centrally placed olecranon, so IVPP V193 may be
correctly referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> after all.<br>
Young
(1942) describes IVPP V190 as "A complete centrum of an anterior caudal
vertebra (or posterior lumbar) with length 66 mm., breadth 41 mm.,
minimum breadth of the centrum 24 mm", noting it "fit in size with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus ceratosauroides</span>" and
calling it Theropoda indet. in the plate caption but also saying there
it "probably belonging to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus
ceratosauroides</span>."  With a length/height ratio of 144% it is
comparable to the ninth caudal of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor
hepingensis</span>
and indistinguishable in lateral view.  It differs in being 85%
wider
than tall vs. 95%, but this is within the range of variation in <span style="font-style: italic;">hepingensis</span>'
caudals.  Notably, this is from a different locality than the
type,
said by Young to be in "the middle part of the" ... "Kuangyuan Series",
layer 5a in Young et al. (1943),
and thus possibly corresponding to the Shangshaximiao Formation. 
IVPP locality 49 is described as being "a few kilometers N. of the city
[Guangyuan] in the hills along the Chengtu-Sian highway", and the
highway connecting Chengdu and Xi'an (as the cities are now called) is
China National Highway 108, or G108.  Thus
while lacking a plausible connection to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>, it is congruent with
being metriacanthosaurid but may also be e.g. piatnitzkysaurid or
megalosaurid.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
The specimen was discovered in September 1955 (Chinese text of Young
and Sun, 1957).  Young and Sun described IVPP V903 as being from
"Ying-choe-shih some 13 kilometers S. E. of Pichan, east of the Turfan
basin, Sinkiang", but Pichan is now known as Shanshan County while
Sinkiang is Xinjiang.  Dong (1977) lists this locality as
"Yingzuishigou (Langgou) southwest of Qiketai, Shanshan District"
(translated), which can be correlated with the type locality of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hudiesaurus</span>, given by Dong
(1997b) as "Langgou (wolf groove), Qiketia
area, Shanshan County of the Turpan Basin."  Dong (1997a)
indicates
this is IVPP locality 93008-2, but Dong (1992) stated "The beds
yielding the fossil were unknown; the fossil was collected by local
people", so a more precise locality is unlikely to become known. 
Similarly, while Young and Sun initially reported the beds as
Cretaceous, Dong (1977) first notes that "the time of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span> Young
should be of the Later Jurassic Hungshan
series, not of the early Cretaceous Tugulu series. Wei Jingmin also
verifies this point in his recent letter."  Indeed, Dong (1987)
reports
it is from "the late Jurassic Kelaza Formation", currently called the
Kalaza Formation.  Dong (1992) incorrectly calls it "the middle
part of
a left maxilla", which would make no sense as the shorter alveolar wall
would be lateral and the dorsal margin would be rounded in section, the
latter showing this isn't even the anterior part of a right
maxilla. 
Upchurch et al. (2021) repeat this mistake when referring to "part of a
left maxilla of a ‘megalosaurid’" from Qiketai.  Dong (1987)
photographs the medial surface in color on page 70 as "the lower jaw of
cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>",
which shows slight breakage has occured since 1957 and that the
Meckelian groove is deeper than suggested by Young and Sun's
plate. 
Based on dentary depth (~88 mm) we might expect it to be ~31% larger
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span>'s
holotype, although dentary depth seems likely to
increase allometrically with size in large theropods, so perhaps it was
a bit shorter but more robust.<br>
Young and Sun (1957) only compared it to Chinese large theropods known
at the time (<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>
syntypes and referred teeth from Laiyang in the Wangshi Group, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> and Bohlin's Inner
Mongolia ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Prodeinodon</span>),
concluding "Comparing specimen by specimen of all those mentioned
Chinese forms kept in our laboratory the Sinkiang specimen is
doubtlessly closer to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>.
We thus refer our specimen as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus
campi</span>." 
Earlier they stated that "The serration is rather densely arranged,
about 18-26 per centimeter which is much less than the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> and rather close to
that of the teeth of Laiyang referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>", which are far too
late to belong to the genus.  Not only this, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> was distinguished
from <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> (and
thus IVPP V903?) in part by its "smaller size, straightness and
bluntness" which characterize the ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
and ?tyrannosauroid teeth (IVPP V237B-D) no longer placed in the taxon,
while "<span style="font-style: italic;">Prodeinodon mongoliense</span>
[sic] and other carnivorous dinosaur from Inner Mongolia are too scant
for a precise comparison", so even a comparison to Laiyang "<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>"
teeth was based on very little.  Comparison to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> is
limited as detailed descriptions of any of these teeth are lacking, but
the serration density (9-13 per 5 mm) is similar to at least
<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> syntypes IVPP
V235 (8.5 per 5 mm) and V236 (12 per 5
mm), and the replacement tooth of alveolus 4 (III4 in Young and Sun's
figure) is similar in side outline to IVPP V238B.  On the other
hand,
IVPP V235 and V239 are more recurved, and the latter more acute, than
any preserved IVPP V903 teeth, and V238A and V239 have finer serrations
(17-~19 per 5 mm).  The size is similar, with the most complete
tooth
(II1 of Young and Sun) having a FABL of ~21 mm just like IVPP V236, and
the geological ages of the Kalaza Formation and upper Guangyuan Group
may be comparable.  Thus IVPP V903 may belong to the same taxon as
at
least some of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus
campi</span> syntypes (IVPP V236, 238B), but
side outline and serration density (not even specified to carina, let
alone basoapical position) will rarely be sufficient to refer a tooth
to a genus of large theropod.  Note a tooth from Nanhuxiang in the
Kalaza Formation (IVPP coll.) figured by Dong (1977) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span> resembles <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>
syntype IVPP V238A in side outline and based on provenence may belong
to the same taxon as IVPP V903, but in the absense of more data is
placed in Averostra indet. here.<br>
Young and Sun (1957) proposed two potentially characteristic features
of IVPP V903.  First, "the dental foramens below the tooth row are
not
arranged in straight line, but are jumping anteriorly and upwardly in
pair almost regularly", which is also seen in widespread taxa such as
ceratosaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Duriavenator</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dubreuillosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span>,
carcharodontosaurines, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yutyrannus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>.  Second,
"the jaw is obviously thickening at the middle as seen clearly in the
cross-section", referencing the 'lateral shelf' later described by
Molnar (1974).  While the degree of its development is impossible
to
derive from figures without a coronal section, other taxa with a
dorsally angled surface at the level of the primary neurovascular
foramen line include not only <span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span>,
but carcharodontosaurines,
metriacanthosaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kelmayisaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Magnosaurus</span>, and perhaps
<span style="font-style: italic;">Marshosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinbeisaurus</span> among large
theropods.  While
therizinosauroids have dentary shelves (as noted by Chure, 2000),
<span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span> shows these evolved
after phyllodont teeth, and the shelf
structure in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>
is quite different from IVPP V903 and
the taxa listed above, being at or above the alveolar edge and not even
developing until after the fifth tooth, which is more posteriorly
placed due to the edentulous symphysis.  The less angled structure
in
IVPP V903 is thus referred to as a dentary step below.<br>
The next author to comment on IVPP V903 specifically was Molnar (1974),
who in his description of the new theropod <span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span> stated "Such a
lateral [dentary] shelf is not unkown [sic] in theropods, having been
described for at least one other, cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus
campi</span> from
Sinkiang" and correctly notes later that "It is also not clear, and was
not clear to the describers, Young and Sun, that the dentary fragment
from Sinkiang actually pertains to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>." 
The only direct
comparison given is that "It does appear that the dentary fragment of
cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span> was about 5 cm
in maximal width (Young and Sun, 1957, fig.
2), which is pretty close to that (6 cm) of the dentary fragment of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span>" (scaling figures
today, IVPP V903 is ~48 mm while <span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span>
has a broken lateral edge so is 65+ mm).  However, the dentary
fragment
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span> is from the
posterior portion and thus not comparable to
IVPP V903 which only covers the first four alveoli, so that differences
in sectional shape from the latter (more prominent overhang of
Meckelian groove/fossa; vertically concave medial surface above this)
could merely be due to position.  The teeth in both specimens are
only
briefly described but have similar serration densities (9-13 per 5 mm
in IVPP V903 vs. 10-14 mesially and 11-14 distally in <span style="font-style: italic;">Labocania</span>).<br>
Most recently, Chure (2000) agreed "there is no justification for
referring this specimen to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>",
and suggested the lateral
step and labial foramina placed "close to the dorsal margin of the
dentary" are unusual features.  The latter seems to be exaggerated
by
dorsal breakage and is only true of the first four foramina, which is
also found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Monolophosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Piatnitzkysaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dubreuillosaurus</span>, all(?)
carnosaurs including <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and
carcharodontosaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eotyrannus</span>.  Despite
these features, Chure considered IVPP V903 to be "Theropoda
indeterminate" and it has never been compared in detail to other
theropods.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comparisons</span>- IVPP V903 can be
excluded from clades with derived anterior dentary morphologies like
noasaurids, spinosaurids and maniraptoromorphs besides eudromaeosaurs,
with most maniraptoromorphs also being far too small with rare
exceptions.  Compared to ceratosaurids, IVPP V903 differs in
having a
lateral step and from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>
itself in having no lingual grooves
on dentary tooth 2, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Genyodectes</span>
further differs in having a chin under tooth 3.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Monolophosaurus</span> differs in lacking
the lateral
step, having labial foramina arranged in an arc, a Meckelian groove
that ends under tooth 3, and a higher lingual wall.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Marshosaurus</span> is
quite distinct in having an anterodorsally rounded and dorsoventrally
expanded dentary with fewer and larger foramina more ventrally
positioned anteriorly.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Piatnitzkysaurus</span>
lacks a lateral step, has two
rows of labial foramina and a Meckelian groove that ends under tooth
3.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Eustreptospondylus</span>
lacks a lateral step, has a convex ventral edge
under alveoli 2-4, and has a more ventrally placed Meckelian groove
that ends under tooth 4.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Duriavenator</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span> lack a
lateral
step, have randomly arranged labial foramina, and a much lower
anteroventrally angled Meckelian groove that ends under tooth
3, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span> further
differs in having a chin under tooth 3.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Torvosaurus</span> lacks a lateral
step, has a convex ventral edge under alveoli 2-4, and has an extremely
shallow Meckelian groove that isn't obvious as far anterior as alveolus
7.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Dubreuillosaurus</span>
lacks a lateral step, has a
convex ventral edge under alveoli 2-4, has two rows of labial foramina,
a higher lingual wall and a much lower anteroventrally angled Meckelian
groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Magnosaurus</span> has
a convex ventral edge under alveoli 2-4, a
lower lingual wall and a much lower anteroventrally angled
Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Australovenator</span>
lacks a lateral step, and it and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span> have a much lower
Meckelian groove.  Proceratosaurids and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilong</span> are difficult to
compare being articulated with the skull, but both lack lateral steps
at least. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span> lacks a lateral step
and has a much lower anteroventrally
angled
Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Eotyrannus</span>
lacks a lateral step, has an anterodorsal
alveolar notch, an extremely shallow Meckelian groove that ends under
tooth 4 and a lower
lingual wall.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinbeisaurus</span>
has smaller anterior teeth so that three
alveoli are anterior to the chin and a Meckelian groove that ends under
tooth 4.  Dromaeosaurids (represented by
<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>) lack a lateral step
and have a much lower
Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Asfaltovenator</span>
lacks a lateral step, and has a
convex ventral edge under alveoli 2-4.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Kelmayisaurus</span> has a convex
ventral edge under alveoli 2-4, an accessory labial groove at
midheight, and a lower anteroventrally angled
Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
lacks a lateral step, has a convex
ventral edge
under alveoli 2-4, and a lower
Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>
lacks a lateral step, has two rows of
labial foramina, and a lower Meckelian groove.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> has
the labial foramina in a groove, and a lower Meckelian groove that ends
under tooth
3. 
Carcharodontosaurines differ in having anteriorly diverging Meckelian
and paradental grooves, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus
iguidensis</span> itself has
a lower lingual wall, lower Meckelian groove and second row of labial
foramina; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span> both have
lower
anteroventrally angled
Meckelian grooves but <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>
does not.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>
is an
important taxon to compare IVPP V903 with given the standard dating of
the Shangshaximiao Formation and geographical proximity, but any
comparisons are limited by the type's dentary being partially hidden by
the articulated upper jaw and CV 00216's anterior dentary only being
figured somewhat schematically in medial view.  Regardless, it
lacks a
lateral step until perhaps the posterior half of the alveolar margin
and has a convex ventral edge under alveoli 2-4, but in medial view the
angle, height and anterior extent of the Meckelian groove are similar
as is the height
of the lingual wall.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor
dongi</span> is almost identical except the
portion anterior to the chin is more elongate and the groove ventral to
the Meckelian groove is deeper.  <span style="font-style: italic;">S.
hepingensis</span> is more similar in
having a shorter pre-chin section and lacking a groove below the
Meckelian groove, but the anterior extent of its lateral step is less
obvious.  <br>
Thus of theropods with laterally and medially figured anterior
dentaries, IVPP V903 is most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>.  <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span> has similar serration
densities in mesial dentary
teeth (10-18 per 5 mm; average 11-14.6 vs. 9-13 in IVPP V903), as does
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> in isolated teeth
(7-15 per 5 mm). 
Importantly, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> is
Late Cretaceous and
other
carcharodontosaurids are less similar.  Metriacanthosaurids are
very common in
Middle-Late Jurassic China on the other hand, making them the most
likely identity for IVPP V903.  While seemingly more similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>, it may be more
recent than named species of either and contemporaneous/synonymous with
more poorly resolved taxa like <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>?
"longqiaoensis" instead.  Because of this and the poor existing
descriptions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>
dentaries, IVPP V903 is merely placed as Metriacanthosauridae here.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carrano et al., 2012) differs from <i>Sinraptor</i>

neural spines lower (about 1.8 times centrum height); dorsal centra
relatively longer; more pronounced margin of the antorbital fossa on
the jugal (also in <i>hepingensis</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>' holotype was discovered in
1976, while <i>Y. magnus</i>'
holotype was found in September 1973.  Note that early sources all
give the
original description's title's translation as "Note on a new carnosaur (<i>Yanchuangosaurus
shangyuanensis</i> gen. et sp. nov.) from the Jurassic of Yangchuan
District, Szechuan Province."  Paul (1988), Holtz et al. (2004)
and Carrano et al. (2012) all consider <i>magnus</i> to be synonymous
with <i>shangyouensis</i>. Paul believed the ilium and tibia were
poorly ossified in <i>shangyouensis</i>' type, showing it to be a
juvenile (though far younger juveniles like <i>Scipionyx</i> have
expanded preacetabular processes showing full ossification). Carrano et
al. noted the (pro-?, or accessory?) maxillary fossa being developed
into a fenestra in <i>magnus</i> is congruent with that specimen being
older. In addition, variation in pneumatic features is common in
theropods, even between sides of the same individual. Of Dong et al.'s
(1983) other characters to distinguish the species, larger size in <i>magnus</i>
could be ontogenetic, <i>magnus</i> lacks a foramen at the base of the
posterodorsal dentary process but surangular foramina are known to vary
in presence in <i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i> individuals, and <i>shangyouensis</i>'
type has a tapered preacetabular process that may be artificial but
also varies in <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> individuals.<br>
<b>"Szechuanoraptor"</b>- Dong et al. (1978) list <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>
"yandonensis" as a new species in a faunal list of taxa from the
Wujiaba quarry of the Shangshaximiao Formation. There is no description
or illustration, making this a nomen nudum. In 1983, Dong et al. note
there was only a single large theropod skeleton in the Wujiaba quarry,
described by them as a neotype of <i>Szechuanosaurus campi</i>. It can
be implied that Dong et al. originally believed CV 00214 to be a new
species of <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>, but later decided to include it in <i>S.
campi</i>. Note that Dong et al.'s attempt at a neotype designation is
invalid, as the ICZN requires the original type(s) to be lost or
destroyed (Article 75.3.4) and that the new specimen "came as nearly as
practicable from the original type locality" (Article 75.3.6) whereas
CV 00214 is from a different stratigraphic group than <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>'
types. To make CV 00214 a neotype merely due to the suggested
undiagnosability of <i>S. campi</i>'s syntypes would require an ICZN
petition (Article 75.5).<br>
Paul (1988) stated the teeth associated with CV 00214 lack roots and
thus were shed by a scavenger, but Dong et al. state "the tooth root is
longer than the crown, is exposed, and elliptical" for some lateral
teeth. As the article was written in Chinese and the current English
tranlation dates from 1999, it is possible Paul mistook figure 39
(which reproduces drawings of rootless <i>S. campi</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> syntypes) as figures
of teeth found with CV 00214. He placed the specimen in <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>
(along with <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>), as <i>Metriacanthosaurus? sp.</i>.
Paul stated "there are so many uncertainties about this beast that I
balk at giving it a new name." Yet in the earlier discussion of <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>,
Paul refers to the species as <i>M. carpenteri</i> and states it
belongs in a separate subgenus than <i>M. parkeri</i> and <i>M.
shangyouensis</i>. One may conclude Paul originally intended to name
the taxon, but later changed his mind and didn't catch all the times he
had used the name. In any case, "carpenteri" is a nomen nudum since
ICZN Article 11.5 states "To be available, a name must be used as valid
for a taxon when proposed ..." <br>
Chure (2000) used this specimen as the holotype of his new species
"Szechuanoraptor dongi" in his unpublished thesis. Names in theses
aren't usually listed in this website, and this one is only because it
was later published by Glut (2003). Glut's work includes a caveat to
the effect that it is not available to establish new taxonomy however,
so the name remains unofficial. Chure referred the specimens of <i>Szechuanosaurus?
zigongensis</i> to "Szechuanoraptor dongi" as well, but this seems
incorrect, since they are from an earlier formation and differ
morphologically.<br>
Carrano et al. (2012) agreed with Paul that CV 00214 could not be
referred to <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>, and also with me in that <i>zigongensis</i>
is from an earlier formation and they could not identify apomorphies
shared between them. They found the specimen to be sister to <i>Yangchuanosaurus
shangyouensis</i> in their analysis and synonymized the species.<br>

and the proximal part of the humerus being less expanded transversely;
from <i>Monolophosaurus</i> and <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> in the

opisthocoelous cervical vertebrae; from <i>Piatnitzkysaurus</i> in the
gradually sloping anterior rim of the maxilla and the less expanded

pronounced olecranon process of the ulna and the lack of a medial

steeply sloping posterodorsal rim of the ilium; from <i>Proceratosaurus</i>
in the more massive and relatively shorter posterior part of the
maxilla. <br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) only cervical vertebrae 2-4
opisthocoelous, remainder amphiplatyan.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Gao's (1993)
original diagnosis was- "moderate in size with an approximate length of
six meters. Cervical vertebra count is 10, with opisthocoelous anterior
and median centra and platycoelous posterior centra. Cervical ribs are
gracile and long. Dorsal vertebral count is 13, centra are
amphiplatyan, and plate-shaped neural spines are moderately high. The
five sacral neural spines are unfused. Anterior caudal neural spines
are narrow, and the prezygapophyses on the posterior caudals are
elongated. The scapula is moderately broad. The deltopectoral crest on
the humerus is particularly well developed. Radius is 56% the length of
the humerus. Metatarsal IV is vestigial. The ilium is particularly low,
the distal pubis is booted, and a muscular attachment crest on the
distal ischium is well developed."<br>
<b>Comments</b>- ZDM 9011 was discovered in 1984 and incorrectly stated
in Downs' English translation as being "initially described as <i>Gasosaurus</i>",
but Google Translate provides the more logical translation of it being

It
was </span></span></span>described by Gao (1993) as a species of <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>
based on a number of characters shared with CV 00214 and He's Hexi
Commune tetanurine material that are largely symplesiomorphies-
"opisthocoelous anterior and median cervicals with plate shaped neural
spines; 13 amphiplatyan dorsals with moderately high plate-shaped
neural spines that are constricted at their midsection; 5 fused
sacrals; platycoelous caudals; ilium being low, pubic shaft being
slender and long with an undeveloped distal boot; and there is an
expanded distal ischiac crest for muscle attachment".  Most of
these are repeated in the diagnosis of this new species, <span style="font-style: italic;">S. zigongensis</span>.  Chure (2000)
referred the hypodigm to his new taxon "Szechuanoraptor dongi" (based
on CV 00214), needlessly creating a new species name, but there appears
to be little reason for such a referral, as Carrano et al. (2012) note.
The specimens derive from different formations and differ
morphologically, with Carrano et al. finding <i>zigongensis</i> to be
sister to <i>Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis</i> instead. They
therefore renamed it <i>Yangchuanosaurus zigongensis</i>. While
recovered outside Orionides by both Rauhut (2000) and Holtz et al.
(2004), this requires 11 more steps in Carrano et al.'s analysis, so is
probably not true. <br>

<p><b><a name="Metriacanthosaurinae"></a>Metriacanthosaurinae</b> Paul,
1988<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (<i>Metriacanthosaurus parkeri</i> &lt;- <i>Yangchuanosaurus
shangyouensis</i>) (Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus, 2015; modified from
Carrano, Benson and Sampson, 2012)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carrano et al., 2012) anteroventral border of
maxillary antorbital fossa demarcated by raised ridge; pronounced
ventral keel on anterior dorsal vertebrae (also in <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>);
straight posterior margin of iliac postacetabular process; angle of
less than 60 degrees between long axes of pubic shaft and boot;
ventrally curved ischial shaft; bulbous fibular crest on tibia.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Paul (1988) originally used this as a subfamily of
eustreptospondylids, including all metriacanthosaurids known at the
time (<i>Yangchuanosaurus</i> and <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>). Carrano
et al. (2012) later recovered a much larger Metriacanthosauridae and
used Paul's subfamily as a name for one subclade, though they
mistakenly think Paul named the family instead and thus credit
themselves with the subfamily.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
While Wu et al. stated "According to paleostratigraphical studies of
the area, the new dinosaur site is located within the lower member of
the Upper Lufeng Formation (Zhang and Li, 1999)", Sekiya (2011) noted
Fang et al. 2000 restudied the Upper Lufeng Formation and renamed this
lower member the Chuanjie Formation, which has been followed since.<br>
Wu et al. merely considered <i>Shidaisaurus</i> a tetanurine, perhaps
non-avetheropod due to the absent axial pleurocoel. Carrano et al.
(2012) included it in their tetanurine analysis and found it to be a
basal metriacanthosaurine.<br>

leading from the centroprezygodiapophyseal fossa posteromedially into
pneumatic chambers in the neural arch; manual phalanx II-1 with ventral
sulcus proximally that is almost completely enclosed by medial and
lateral ventral flanges; dorsal margin of ilium slopes steeply
posteroventrally (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>);
narrow and deep intercondylar groove on anterior side of distal femur;
robust and well-developed medial epicondylar crest on distal femur,
considerably offset proximally from distal end<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Material of the
holotype and paratype was initially discovered in 2006, then excavated
further in 2014, 2016-2017 and 2023.  *Rauhut et al. (2024) find
"A few elements, including teeth and a furcula, cannot be confidently
assigned to either of the two individuals. However, as there are no
indications for any other larger vertebrates in the locality, ... these
materials are here regarded as referred specimens. In the case of the
teeth, this should be seen as tentative, especially for the possible
premaxillary teeth, as it cannot be ruled out that these elements
represent shed teeth of scavengers." Unlike other carnosaurs, the
authors note these "have a rather round cross-section, are notably
recurved, and lack carinae or serrations" and "resemble teeth of
certain crocodyliforms (e.g. pholidosaurids)", but since "most Jurassic
terrestrial crocodiles are considerably smaller than the animal that
these teeth were derived from, which is also the case for the vast
majority of the crocodyliform remains described from the Balabansai
Formation" and as "no crocodyliform remains were found at the FTU-1
locality", they "consider the possibility that these teeth represent
premaxillary teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alpkarakush</span>."
IGM 2-27 is in the materials list as part of the holotype pubes and as
a tooth.  The fact it is later mentioned as a tooth and is not in
the caption of the pubis figure (Figure 15) suggests it is actually a
tooth.  The dorsals IGB 2-10 and 2-11 are labeled "D12(?)" and
"D13(?)" in Figure 8 and positioned with neural spines IGB 2-12 and
2-13 respectively above them, while neural arch fragment IGM 2-22
"might belong to IGB 2-10, but does not directly fit on the broken base
of the centroparapophyseal lamina."  While Figure 7 labels
IGB-2-11 "probably last dorsal vertebra", none of these vertebral
positions are defended in the text.  As "the vast majority of
elements recovered from site FTU-1" are assigned to the holotype,
Rauhut et al. "consider it likely" the furcula "comes from the same
animal. However, it cannot be excluded that it might represent the
smaller, paratype individual."  The metatarsal II is incorrectly
stated to be the left element in the materials list.  For the
holotype, Rauhut et al. concluded "The minimum age at the time of death
can be estimated with 17 years. However, possible resorption of
additional growth marks by the expanding medullary cavity during
growth, the weak zonation in the middle unit of the femoral bone wall,
and the slightly higher counts of growth marks in other areas of the
posterolateral bone wall strongly indicate an older age", while the
paratype's tibia only had three growth lines and "belonged to a large
juvenile or a small subadult."<br>
Rauhut et al. (2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix
to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Alpkarakush</span> as a
metriacanthosaurine in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Metriacanthosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>.  It is placed
as more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Shidaisaurus</span>
here due to Carrano et al.'s characters 265-1 (Ilium, height of lateral
wall of brevis fossa relative to medial wall: shorter anteriorly,
exposing medial wall in lateral view), 293-1 (Ischium, shaft
orientation: ventrally curved), 296-1 (Ischium, notch ventral to
obturator process: present) and Rauhut et al.'s mentioned "transverse
dimensions of mid-sacral vertebrae reduced in relation to first and
last sacral", but is more like <span style="font-style: italic;">Shidaisaurus</span>
in Carrano et al.'s character 280-0 (Ilium, shape of posterior margin
of postacetabular process: convex) and intermediate between <span style="font-style: italic;">Shidaisaurus</span>
and derived metriacanthosaurines in Carrano et al.'s character 285

<b>Comments</b>- Grady (1993) states the holotype was found on
September 2 1987
at Quarry 6, when Braman "found a small theropod near the spot where he
had been excavating a crocodile" ... and Currie "dug out two vertebrae,
a scapulocoracoid or shoulder blade, a toe bone, and the end of what
looked like a fibula."  "Before the day ended three ribs, six
phalanges, a humerus, four metatarsals, and a claw nearly eight
centimeters long had been added to the list of specimens", "another,
smaller [than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>'s
paratypes] allosaurid tooth" and that Currie "also found a calcaneum
and astraglus ... that ... fit together perfectly."  On September
14
Currie realized "What he thought was a fibula was in fact part of a
femur" and "he had exposed two more metatarsals, two phalanges, a
distal tarsal, and the end of a fibula."  It was first announced
in Anderson (1987a) as "Jiangjunmiaosaurus", a name generally
associated with what was eventually named <i>Monolophosaurus</i>. The
article mentions preserved feet and "the whole" skeleton, unlike the <i>Monolophosaurus</i>
type. Anderson's (1987b) later article clarifies that "it has been
tentatively labelled a jiangjunmiaosaurus, a carnivore first found in
the Junggar Basin in 1983 by Zhao Xi Lin." The latter matches the
discovery of <i>Monolophosaurus</i>' holotype, so it's apparent <i>Sinraptor</i>
was originally thought to be another <i>Monolophosaurus</i> specimen
when first discovered. The second article contains photos of <i>Sinraptor
dongi</i>'s hindlimb elements and mentions Currie felt it was probably
related to allosaurs. Paul (1988) mentions the specimen as an
allosaurine where "the nasal ridges and orbital horn are combined into
a prominent pair of long, low, rugose-surfaced crests", which clearly
described <i>Sinraptor</i> though Paul uses the same
"Jinagjunmiaosaurus" and mentions pers. comm. with Dong, so the
specimens were probably still thought to be conspecific. Currie and
Zhao (1991) reported on both <i>Monolophosaurus</i> and <i>Sinraptor</i>
in their abstract, still unnamed, so that Olshevsky (1991) listed both
"Jiangjunmiaosaurus" and "Monolophosaurus" as separate genera, not
realizing the proper connection noted above.  Dong (1992) lists
this specimen as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>
new species Currie and Zhao (in press.)", and calls it "a nearly
complete skeleton of a theropod that is similar to<span style="font-style: italic;"> Allosaurus.</span>" The taxon was finally
described by Currie and Zhao (1994) in a monograph which assigned it to
their new family Sinraptoridae. Note that while volume 30(10) of the
Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences lists its date as October 1993, it
was not published until February or March of 1994. The quadrate was
later described by Currie (2006), while the braincase was redescribed
in depth by Paulina Carabajal and Currie (2012) and the teeth by
Hendrickx et al. (2020). <br>
Currie and Zhao (1994) mention "nine isolated, shed teeth in the
collections of the IVPP that were recovered from a sauropod (IVPP
87001) found in a quarry less than a kilometre from the holotype"
"collected by the Dinosaur Project in 1987 and 1988."  Notably,
Figure 65 of Dong (1992) shows that IVPP V87001 is a locality at
Jiangjunmiao, not a specimen number of the sauropod itself.  The
specimen is not <span style="font-style: italic;">Mamenchisaurus?
sinocanadorum</span> (IVPP locality 87004) or <span style="font-style: italic;">Bellusaurus</span> (IVPP locality 830003),
nor is it <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus</span>
which was excavated by 1984.  Grady (1993) writes about this
"second sauropod quarry" and notes on September 1 1987 Russell, Tang
and Danis "dislodged four carnivore teeth" that were "similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
teeth: curved and barbed and containing "blood grooves" down the sides"
and that on September 2 "More teeth were found in the second sauropod
quarry: a total of nine so far, all apparently allosaurid."<br>
Clark et al.'s (2002) SVP presentation announced a new skull and
cervicals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>, but
this has not yet been published.<br>
Xu and Clark (2008) described a large tooth found between 2001 and 2007
"preserved within a partial sauropod skeleton." as "a gigantic
sinraptorid, either a taxon assignable or closely related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus magnus</span> [seemingly
based on size alone], ... or an old individual of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>."  Its crown length
is 145% the size of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span>'s
largest preserved holotype tooth (rmax4), and its Crown Base Ratio is
almost identical to the third maxillary tooth and an isolated dentary
tooth (0.51 vs. 0.5043 and 0.5053) which it is 155% and 227% the size
of respectively. The Crown Height Ratio of 2.63 is more similar to the
third maxillary (2.4371) than the dentary tooth (2.1342) though,
suggesting it is an anterior maxillary tooth as well.  Using the
155% ratio would lead to a body length of 11.8 meters, rounded to 12
here.  Denticle morphology appears identical.  Size
differences between it and the type could easily be ontogenetic or
individual. <br>
He et al. (2013)
described a metatarsal IV from Wucaiwan discovered since 2000 by the
joint IVPP-CAS-GWU expedition, resolving it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span> in their
phylogenetic analysis of metatarsal IV characters. They noted it
resembled <i>S. dongi</i> except for being more robust and having a
lateral condyle smaller than the medial one. While the authors
interpreted these as species-level differences, they are here
considered individual variation considering the vast amount of
variation in e.g. <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>. 
It should be noted that besides the <span style="font-style: italic;">S.
dongi</span> holotype the only preserved sinraptorid metatarsal IV is
that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>
specimen CV 00214, which was described in very basic terms and only
figured in oblique medial view largely covered by other pedal elements.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carrano et al., 2012) differs from <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>
in- proportionally long, low skull; very tall dorsal vertebral neural
spines.<br>
differs from <i>Sinraptor dongi</i> in- sinuous, rugose nasal crest;
marked margin of jugal antorbital fossa; more horizontally oriented
pubic boot.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1985 and initially
thought to be a specimen of <i>Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis</i>
(e.g. fig. 57 in Dong, 1992 which labels it "A new, nearly complete
skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus
shangyouensis</span> was collected by Zigong Dinosaur Museum from the
vicinity (Heping) of Zigong in 1986"). While initially assigned to <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>
in its description (Gao, 1992), Currie and Zhao (1994) placed <i>hepingensis</i>
in their new genus <i>Sinraptor</i>. Note that while volume 30(10) of
the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences lists its date as October 1993,
it was not published until February or March of 1994. Gao (1999) and
Xing et al. (2009) disagree, placing both <i>hepingensis</i> and <i>dongi</i>
in <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>. Carrano et al. (2012) found <i>hepingensis</i>,
<i>Shidaisaurus</i>, <i>Siamotyrannus</i> and <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>
to be closer to <i>Sinraptor</i> than to <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>.
Thus <i>Sinraptor</i> cannot merely be synonymized with <i>Yangchuanosaurus</i>
without including all metriacanthosaurids, in which case <i>Metriacanthosaurus</i>
would have priority.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Paul (1988) used Allosauria for what would now be
called Carnosauria, though he excluded metriacanthosaurids and included
<i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Proceratosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids. As
Paul's Allosauridae included known carcharodontosaurids (<i>Shaochilong</i>,
<i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i>Altispinax</i>, <i>Labocania</i> and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>),
Carrano et al. (2012) used Allosauria for the
allosaurid+carcharodontosaurid clade of carnosaurs. They provided no
definition, though (<i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> + <i>Carcharodontosaurus
saharicus</i>, -<i>Metriacanthosaurus parkeri</i>) would be the obvious
choice and was later published by Hendrickx et al. (2015). Several
analyses such as Allain (2002) have instead found carcharodontosaurids
to group with metriacanthosaurids to the exclusion of allosaurids,
which takes six more steps when enforced in Carrano et al.'s matrix, so
is still quite possible.<br>

<b> Comments</b>- Brusatte and Sereno's (2008) definition differs from
Holtz et al.'s (2004) by including <i>Passer</i> as an external
specifier. The only times carcharodontosaurids have been placed in
Coelurosauria is when tyrannosaurids were as well (Bakker et al., 1988;
Paul, 1988), and they have often been placed closer to tyrannosaurids
than to <i>Allosaurus</i> or <i>Passer</i> (Paul, 1988; Kurzanov,
1989; Molnar et al., 1990). So <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> would be a more
useful tertiary external specifier than <i>Passer</i>. The remote
possibility of a relationship to ceratosaurs (Bonaparte et al., 1990)
might suggest <i>Carnotaurus</i> should be used as an additional
external specifier.<br>
Molnar (2001) proposed Acrocanthosauridae for at least <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>, but did not provide a definition or
diagnosis (ICZN Article 13.1.1), so the taxon is a nomen nudum.<br>
Benson et al. (2010) found megaraptorans grouped with <i>Neovenator</i>
as basal carcharodontosaurids, but redefined Carcharodontosauridae to
include only those taxa closer to <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> than to <i>Neovenator</i>.
They then gave their new taxon Carcharodontosauria the tradition
definition for Carcharodontosauridae. These taxonomic changes are here
seen as unecessary and not followed. Benson et al.'s paper was
originally released online in November 2009 but not officialy published
until January 2010.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?(ML 555) femur (Antunes and Mateus, 2003)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Malafaia et
al., 2020) large recesses in neural arch of anterior dorsal vertebrae;
well-developed and continuous longitudinal laminae extending from the
tip of the prezygapophyses to the distal end of the postzygapophyses in
mid caudal vertebrae; supraacetabular crest of ilium forming a
prominent ventrolaterally projecting shelf.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The
holotype was found by a
private collector and donated to the SHN in 2008.  As noted by
Malafaia et al. (2017), "three isolated teeth were collected in the
same site and they have a morphology and size compatible with the
postcranial elements", but they "do not preserve any parts of the root,
suggesting that they correspond to shed teeth."  They thus
excluded the teeth (SHN.03630-32) from the hypodigm.  Malafaia et
al.
(2008) referred gastralia to the specimen, but these are not mentioned
or listed in the 2017 osteology.  Malafaia et al. (2020)
reidentify the
supposed articulated axis and axial intercentrum as a partial
post-axial cervical vertebra.<br>
The holotype was originally described in an extended abstract by
Malafaia et al. (2008) as Allosauroidea indet., though they noted
differences from both <span style="font-style: italic;">Lourinhanosaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>.  They
further said "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">it
remains to be determined whether the differences detected in the
Valmitão theropod are due to the specimen's belonging to a new taxon,
or, more likely, indicate that it is an immature specimen of the
previously described taxa."</span>  Malafaia et al. (2017)
described
the specimen in detail as Allosauroidea gen. et sp. indet. (despite
recovering four autapomorphies), and added it to Carrano et al.'s
tetanurine matrix to find it resolved as a non-carcharodontosaurid
allosaurian.  Malafaia et al. (2009) first described SHN.019 in a
2007
symposium proceeding as "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">consistent with the available material of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span> from </span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">Andrés</span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">,
therefore they are preliminarily considered co-specific."  </span>It
was later described in more detail by Malafaia et al. (2019) as
Carcharodontosauria gen. et sp. indet., who stated "this specimen
together with a previously described specimen, SHN.036, may represent
an allosauroid distinct from the taxa currently known in the Upper
Jurassic of the Lusitanian Basin.  Malafaia et al. (2020) followed
this
to its conclusion, naming a new taxon using SHN.036 as the holotype
with SHN.019 referred, finding <span style="font-style: italic;">Lusovenator</span>
to be a basal carcharodontosaurid in a trichotomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Siats</span> and more derived taxa, again
based on a version of Carrano et al.'s analysis.  <br>
A femur (ML 555) from the Sobral Formation originally referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Lourinhanosaurus</span>
by Antunes and Mateus (2003) was removed from that taxon by Malafaia et
al. (2020).  They stated "ML 555 has a femoral head that projects
dorsomedially, which is a feature that has been interpreted as a
synapomorphy of Carcharodontosauria", so it is here provisioonally
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Lusovenator</span>
although it cannot be directly compared to the holotype and has not

Chokchaloemwong et al., 2019) jugal with straight ventral margin; jugal
with dorsoventrally deep anterior process below orbit; surangular with
deep oval concavity at posterior end of lateral shelf; four posterior
surangular foramina; long and narrow groove along suture between
surangular and prearticular; articular with foramen at notch of the
suture with prearticular; anterior cervical vertebra with additional
pneumatic foramen excavating parapophysis; cervical and posterior
dorsal vertebra penetrated by a pair of small foramina bilaterally
at 
base of neural spine.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was discovered
between 2007 and 2009, and first announced in an abstract by Azuma et
al. (2011).  They referred it to Carcharodontosauria, and listed a
metatarsal among the materials, perhaps a mistake for the unmentioned
pedal phalanx.  Samathi (2016) later mentioned it as "an
undescribed partial skull, teeth, and postcranial skeleton of a
carcharodontosaurian."  The hypodigm consists of at least three
individuals
based on the number of right premaxillae and left posterior
mandibles. 
Being &lt;10% different in size, it is not possible to assign elements
to each individual, although Chokchaloemwong et al. state the distal
end "probably belongs to the same bone as the proximal part."  <br>

Chokchaloemwong et al. (2019) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamraptor</span>
to Carrano et al.'s tetanurine analysis where it emerged as the most
basal carcharodontosaurid (their Carcharodontosauria), and to Novas et
al.'s tetanurine analysis where it emerged as a carcharodontosaurid in
a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eocarcharia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Concavenator</span> and more derived

it is very incomplete."  While Buffetaut and Suteethorn (2012)
described it as a carcharodontosaurid based on the extent of
interdental plate fusion, Samathi et al. (2019) notes other theropods
show this character as well and that a "comparison will be done in a
future study."  The alveoli are broader than in the later
carcharodontosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamraptor</span>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Hutt et al., 1996) five premaxillary teeth
(also in <i>Allosaurus</i>); external naris twice as long as high;
maxilla with large maxillary fenestra approximately one sixth the
length of the maxillary tooth row; tooth crowns one quarter total tooth
length; pedal unguals with groove on extensor surface. <br>
(after Naish et al., 2001) premaxilla with accessory interpremaxillary
peg and socket articulation in the dorsal region of the symphysis.<br>
(after Brusatte et al., 2008) transverse expansion of the anterior
articular surface of the axial intercentrum; lateral foramina on the
anterior surface of the odontoid; small single foramen on the lateral
surface of the axial neural spine; fusion of the cervical ribs to the
posterior cervical vertebrae; camellate internal texture exposed
externally on parapophyseal facets of eighth and ninth cervical
vertebrae (possibly due to fusion with ribs); ventral surfaces of
anterior dorsal vertebrae developed as sharp ridges, not inset from the
lateral surface of the centra; hypapophyses of anterior dorsal
vertebrae developed as low mound-like eminences; curved flanges
emerging laterally from pre- and postzygapophyseal facets of posterior
dorsal vertebrae; scapula-coracoid glenoid fossa that is wider
mediolaterally than long anteroposteriorly; shelf adjacent to the
preacetabular notch on the medial surface of the ilium; distal ischial
boot in which the left and right ischia are conjoined anteriorly but
diverge posterolatcrally; femoral head oriented anteromedially and
inclined proximally; robust ridge on the external surface of the lesser
trochanter of the femur; thumbprint-shaped depression on posterior
surface of femoral shaft lateral to the proximal end of the fourth
trochanter; proximodistally short, notch-like extensor groove and
almost flat anterior surface of distal end of femur; suboval rugosity
on medial surface of distal tibia; anteroposteriorly pinched proximal
portion of the lateral malleolus of the distal tibia; ventral spine on
anterolateral crest of fibular condyle of tibia; concave lateral
surface of metatarsal II for articulation with metatarsal III.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hutt et al. (1996) included a large external
naris in their diagnosis, but Brusatte et al. (2008) noted it was
similar in size to most carnosaurs. Posterior dorsal centra that are
pleurocoelous are found in other carcharodontosaurids as well.<br>
Naish et al. (2001) included high dorsolateral nasal crests in their
diagnosis, but Brusatte et al. (2008) note these are also present in <i>Allosaurus</i>.
Brusatte et al. also note serrations which complete across tooth tips
are now known in many other theropod taxa. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1978 and collected over
the next two decades, becoming accessioned in two museums. Hutt (1999)
and Martill and Naish (2001) referred to the dentary in the holotype as
BMNH R10001, but it has apparently never been stored at the NHMUK (was
BMNH) and may be an MIWG specimen. The paratype was discovered in 1987
and originally thought to be a different species (Hutt et al., 1990),
as the holotype was thought to have a small pubic boot based on an
incorrectly identified ischium. MIWG 5470 was discovered in 1985.<br>
Though generally believed to be a basal carcharodontosaurid now, <i>Neovenator</i>
was originally assigned to Allosauridae. This requires 7 more steps
when enforced in Carrano et al.'s (2012) matrix, so is less likely but
still possible.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Tanaka et al. (2020)
first published about this specimen in an abstract, then named it the
following year.  Nessov (1995) referred the maxilla CCMGE
600/12457 to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, but it was reidentified as
dromaeosaurid by Averianov and Sues (2012) and described as cf. <i>Itemirus</i>
by Sues and Averianov (2014). Tanaka et al. (2021) referred it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ulughbegsaurus</span> along with maxillary
fragment ZIN PH 357/16 that was described as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Itemirus</span>
by Sues and Averianov.  Tanaka et al. (2021) also suggested "it is
possible that some of the large tyrannosauroid teeth reported from
Dzharakuduk of the Bissekty Formation (with CBLs up to 26.6 mm and CBR
to 0.41-0.70) could belong to carcharodontosaurians."  Tanaka et
al. (2020) entered it into Carrano's Tetanurae analysis where it
emerged in a
polytomy with megaraptorans and <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>,
while in the 2021 publication they also added it to Novas' tetanurine
analysis and recovered in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Concavenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eocarcharia</span>.

is more similar to the former in the tall antorbital fossa below the

a specimen collected and owned by the chain. He assigns this unofficial
taxon to Carnosauria, and indeed it strongly resembles the posterior
dorsal of <i>Mapusaurus</i>. Thus it may belong to the contemporaneous
<i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> or <i>Saurionops</i>,
but cannot be compared to either. Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019)
published the name as a nomen nudum, stating ""Osteoporosia gigantea"
is the informal name of a supposed gigantic megaraptorid that was 15 m
long, but it seems to have been a significantly smaller

<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R1828) (~5 m) tenth dorsal vertebra, eleventh
dorsal vertebra, twelfth dorsal vertebra, two vertebrae (lost), two
ribs (lost)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Naish, 2011) posterior dorsal spines
transversely expanded at tips; large. rectangular hyposphene in
posterior dorsals (unknown in <i>Concavenator</i>).<br>
(after Cuesta et al., 2013) (compared to <i>Concavenator</i>) less
ventrally constricted centra; anteriorly angled posterior dorsal neural
spines; posterior dorsal neural spines distally expanded
anteroposteriorly; posterior dorsal neural spines transversely broader.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Olshevsky (1991) listed "firm contact between
the apexes of the neural spines of vertebrae #9 and 10 (and,
presumably, later vertebrae in the series)", but this is also present
in <i>Concavenator</i> (though the vertebrae are 11 and 12 in the
latter genus and presumably <i>Becklespinax</i> too). <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon has a complicated nomenclatural history. <i>Altispinax</i>
was initially proposed by Huene (1923) for "the species described as <i>M.
dunkeri</i> by Lydekker (Dames)" ... "distinguished from <i>Megalosaurus</i>
by its enormously high neural spines in the dorsal region" (referencing
three high-spined dorsal vertebrae catalogd as NHMUK R1828), which was
misunderstood by future authors as proposing a new genus for Dames'
(1884) <i>Megalosaurus dunkeri</i>. As <i>M. dunkeri</i>'s holotype
is an incomparable tooth, Stovall and Langston (1950) concluded "<span style="font-style: italic;">Altispanax dunkeri</span>
(Dames) is a valid form only when the type material is understood to
include only the three dorsal vertebrae described by Owen" (NHMUK
R1828), but Dames' species already had a holotype which could not be
replaced without an ICZN petition. Paul (1988) solved this by creating
the new species <i>altispinax</i> for the vertebrae. Paul placed <i>altispinax</i>
in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, but Olshevsky (1991) disagreed and created
the new genus <i>Becklespinax</i> for these vertebrae. Both of these
options left Dames' tooth as <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i>, which has been
the consensus for over a decade. Rauhut (2000; published as 2003) used
a quote from Huene (1932) to justify that author's intent to base <i>Altispinax</i>
on the vertebrae, and so created the combination <i>Altispinax
altispinax</i> for them. Finally, Maisch (2016) recognized that Huene's
initial quote had been misunderstood, proposing <i>Altispinax</i> for
"the species described as <i>M. dunkeri</i> by Lydekker (Dames)", not
the species <i>M. dunkeri</i> (Dames) itself. Utilizing ICZN Article
11.10 ("If an author employs a specific or subspecific name for the
type species of a new nominal genus-group taxon, but deliberately in
the sense of a previous misidentification of it, then the author's
employment of the name is deemed to denote a new nominal species and
the specific name is available with its own author and date as though
it were newly proposed in combination with the new genus-group name"),
Maisch determined the species <i>dunkeri</i> Huene, 1923 is deemed to
be different than <i>dunkeri</i> Dames, 1884. Thus <i>Altispinax
dunkeri</i> Huene, 1923 is a new taxon different from <i>Megalosaurus
dunkeri</i> Dames, 1884. Note Kuhn (1939) was the first to designate <i>dunkeri</i>
as the type species of <i>Altispinax</i> (Huene also initially
referred <i>Megalosaurus oweni</i> to it, now the type species of <i>Valdoraptor</i>).
<br>
Pickering (1995) attempted to make NHMUK R1828 (as BMNH R1828) the
lectotype of <i>Altispinax</i> "lydekkerhueneorum", which included as
paratypes the holotype of <i>Valdoraptor oweni</i> and several
additional specimens (NHMUK R604, 604a-b, 604d). However, the species <i>altispinax,
dunkeri</i> and <i>oweni</i> have priority (Pickering incorrectly
considered them nomina rejecta, which cannot occur without an ICZN
decision), and there is no evidence these specimens are conspecific.
This makes Pickering's species (which is a nomen nudum in any case) an
objective junior synonym of <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i>. <br>
Note abundant additional material was referred to <i>Megalosaurus
dunkeri</i> by Lydekker (1888), then <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> by
Huene (1926), but has not been described in detail so cannot be
compared to the holotypes of either. The contemporaneous Hastings Beds
specimens are listed below, while the Weald Clay (Belgium, England) and
Lower Greensand (England) material is listed as Averostra here.<br>
The holotype dorsals were first referred to <i>Megalosaurus bucklandii</i>
by Owen (1855, 1857), before the nomenclatural saga of <i>Altispinax</i>
described above began. After decades of being assigned largely by
default to Megalosauridae, or to Spinosauridae due to the neural spine
elongation, NHMUK R1828 has more recently been assigned to Allosauridae
as <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Paul, 1988), Eustreptospondylidae based on
similarity to <i>Piatnitzkysaurus</i> (Olshevsky, 1991), Allosauroidea
(Naish, 1999) or Carcharodontosauridae (Naish, 2011; his
Carcharodontosauria). The latter is supported by its similarity to the
recently discovered <i>Concavenator</i>. However, Carrano et al.
(2012) believe the anterior dorsal neural spine is broken, lessening
the resemblence. While Carrano et al. state that within Tetanurae it
can only be excluded from Spinosauridae and Carcharodontosauridae, when
entered conservatively into their matrix it emerges as a carnosaur and
most often sister to <i>Concavenator</i> and <i>Eocarcharia</i>. The
discrepancy is due to the authors stating <i>Altispinax</i> is unlike
carcharodontosaurids in lacking posterior dorsal pleurocoels, but <i>Concavenator</i>
also lacks these.<br>

by Huene (1926), but has not been described in detail so cannot be
compared to the holotypes of either. Lydekker (1890) wrote "The
Hollington metatarsus [the incorrectly associated NHMUK R604d and NHMUK
R1525] agreeing, therefore, in relative size with the type tooth [of <span style="font-style: italic;">dunkeri</span>]
and coming from approximatel  the same geological horizon, there
is every probability that it belongs to the same species, to which I
accordingly propose to refer it", but Stovall and Langston (1950)
correctly disagreed, stating "It is widely recognized<br>
that the relative size of individual and homologous skeletal elements
cannot be employed as a criterion for generic and specific
identification in the large saurischian reptiles. The conclusion of
Lydekker becomes even more untenable when it is realized that the size
of carnosaurian teeth may vary greatly within the dental series of a
single individual. In view of the above statement, the correlative
geologic horizons seem to be of no great importance in the present
instance inasmuch as the two locations are widely separated." 
They may belong to <i>Baryonyx, Altispinax, Valdoraptor, Neovenator,
Calamosaurus, Eotyrannus</i> or another Wealden theropod. NHMUK R604a,
604c-d and 1525 were referred to <i>Valdoraptor</i> (then <i>Megalosaurus</i>)
<i>oweni</i> by Lydekker (1890), but this has not been accepted by
recent workers. Pickering (1995) intended to use the 604 specimens as
paratypes of his proposed species <i>Altispinax</i>
"lydekkerhueneorum", but this is a nomen nudum and objective junior
synonym of <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> (see entry).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Ortega et al., 2010) four nasal recesses,
three of them connected (unknown in <i>Altispinax</i>); alarge,
rounded, thickened postorbital brow occupying one-third of the orbit
(unknown in <i>Altispinax</i>); relatively high, anteriorly directed
neurapophyses of second and third caudal vertebrae (unknown in <i>Altispinax</i>);
small, thorn-like posterior process at base of each neurapophysis in
proximal caudal vertebrae (unknown in <i>Altispinax</i>).<br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) differs from <i>Altispinax</i> in-
posterior dorsal centra bear large lateral fossae (although no
foramina); posterior dorsal neural spines have less curved anterior and
posterior margins at their bases; apices of the tallest dorsal neural
spines are anteroposteriorly narrow, curving towards a single apex
formed from multiple spines.<br>
(proposed) tenth dorsal neural spine one third as tall as eleventh
dorsal neural spine; eleventh dorsal neural spine strongly tapered
distally in lateral view; eleventh and twelfth dorsal neural spines
appressed except at base.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Ortega et al. (2010) also included "tall
neurapophyses of the eleventh and twelfth dorsal vertebrae (five times
the height of the centra)" in their diagnosis, but this is also true in
<i>Altispinax</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Ortega et al. (2010) identified a line along the
lateral side of <i>Concavenator</i>'s ulna as possessing quill knobs,
which are otherwise unknown in non-paravian taxa. However, both
Mortimer (online, 2010) and Naish (online, 2010) independantly regard
the structure as an intermuscular line instead, with the former
identifying it more precisely as the line between the extensor carpi
ulnaris and the flexor ulnaris. This is due the more anterior position
of the line, which coincides with the intermuscular boundary on <i>Alligator</i>
and non-maniraptoran theropods, but not with quill knobs in paravians.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Sereno et al. (1994) noted mid-sized
carcharodontosaurid teeth from the Elrhaz Formation. Sereno later
mentioned carcharodontosaurid remains from Gadoufaoua in an online
update to his 2000 Project Exploration dig in Niger. These included
teeth, jaw bones and a postorbital (which are elements described for <i>Eocarcharia</i>),
but also vertebrae and pelvic elements. A pubis was photographed in
situ. These may be elements later referred to <i>Kryptops</i>, as no <i>Eocarcharia</i>
postcrania were described in Sereno and Brusatte (2008). <i>Kryptops</i>'
pelvis and dorsals do look somewhat carnosaurian, but the in situ pubis
does not appear to be the <i>Kryptops</i> specimen. <br>
Novas et al. (2013) believed there was not enough evidence to refer the
maxillary and dental material to <i>Eocarcharia</i>, but given the

described
the specimen as <span style="font-style: italic;">Lajasvenator

in a journal pre-proof posted November 25 2019, but this was electronic
and had no mention of ZooBank, so it was a nomen nudum (ICZN Article
8.5.3. states names published electronically must "be registered in the
Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article
78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself that such registration
has occurred") until July 2020.<br>
Coria et al. (2019) added it to Carrano et al.'s tetanurine analysis

Kem Kem beds, Morocco</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (MPM 2594) frontal (186 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Cau et al., 2013) dorsoventrally thickened
frontal (with the depth of the body ranging between 28%, along the
medial suture, and 38%, at the level of the anteromedial margin of the
supratemporal fossa, of bone length); nasal processes of the frontal
with a transversely convex dorsal surface and completely separated
medially by the posteromedial processes of nasal extended along 40% of
the frontal length and reaching the frontal body; thick dome-like
eminence in the anterolateral corner of the dorsal surface of the
frontal at the level of the prefrontal-lacrimal articulations;
anterolateral margin of the lateral surface of the frontal with a
narrow vertical lamina separating the prefrontal facet from an
elliptical fossa in the lacrimal facet; prefrontal facet of the frontal
trapezoidal, barely visible in ventral view, mostly restricted to the
anterodorsal margin of the lateral surface of the bone, and not
participating in the orbital fossa; frontal with interdigitate suture
for prefrontal restricted to the anteroventral corner of the facet,
formed by a low shelf running along the posterolateral margin of the
nasal process and a small finger-like projection; hypertrophied,
D-shaped lacrimal facet of the frontal bordering the whole
posterolateral exposure of the prefrontal facet and with maximum depth
that is four times the depth of the anterior half of the postorbital
facet; dorsal surface of the frontal anterior to the anteromedial
margin of supratemporal fossa raised and facing anterodorsally,
describing with the dorsal dome a posteromedially-anterolaterally
directed saddle-shaped concavity, and confluent with a series of low
rounded rugosities placed posteriorly to the nasal facet.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Cau et al. (2012, 2013) found this specimen to be most
similar to <i>Eocarcharia</i>.<br>
Ibrahim et al. (2020) propose <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span>
is an immature <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus
saharicus</span>,
but this is based on misconceptions.  First, they state it is
"approximately 60% the size of the frontal in the original holotype and
neotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">C. saharicus</span>"
based on the length posterior to the lateral nasal contact, but the
width (~153 mm) is actually greater than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span> neotype (~124
mm).  This shows it is not a smaller specimen and the broadeer
proportions are more like <span style="font-style: italic;">Eocarcharia</span>. 
Ibrahim et al. then claim "a prefrontal articular facet on the frontal
in <span style="font-style: italic;">S. pachytholus</span> is said to
be absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">C. saharicus</span>",
but Cau et al. state in <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span>
"the prefrontal facet is a rounded pit placed anterodorsally to the
orbital margin and in the posterodorsal corner to the lacrimal facet,
thus approaching the postorbital facet."  Ibrahim et al. say
"other immature skull elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">C.
saharicus</span>
found in the Kem Kem Group, such as a postorbital, show less prominent
development of brow ornamentation as one would anticipate in the course
of growth" as if to defend an immature age for <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span>, but it's <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span> that has the "unique
presence of dorsal ornamentations and eminence" compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span>.  Ibrahim
et al. further misunderstand Cau et al.'s wording, as the diagnosis
states it differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span>
"in lacking a dorsomedially inclined anterior half of the dorsal
surface of the frontal, a deeply invaginated anterior margin of the
supratemporal fossa, prominent frontal shelves overhanging the
supratemporal fossa, and an extensively ossified interorbital septum",
whereas Ibrahim think they mean <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span>
has frontal shelves and an ossified interorbital septum.  So these
stand as valid differences between the two taxa.  Cau et al. use
the elongate posteromedial nasal process to distinguish <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span>, so it's not
true that "<span style="font-style: italic;">C. saharicus</span>
shows a similar W-shaped nasal-frontal suture."  The only
objection of Ibrahim et al. that is correct is that "only the central
portion of the supratemporal fossa is preserved in <span style="font-style: italic;">S. pachytholus</span>", so that it cannot
be said to differ from <span style="font-style: italic;">C. saharicus</span>
"in showing a distinct anterolateral corner instead of a more gently
curved anterolateral margin in dorsal view."  <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroniops</span> is retained as valid
here.<br>

distally; tibia strongly bowed laterally; metatarsal III somewhat
constricted proximally.<br>
Currie and Carpenter (2000) also listed the following- lacrimal
contacts postorbital;  pleurocoelous fossae and foramina
pronounced on all presacral and sacral vertebrae.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Langston (1947) originally called this taxon
"Acrocanthus atokaensis" in his thesis before describing it as <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
with Stovall in 1950. The initial nomen nudum was published by
Czaplewski et al. (1994).  The paratype was discovered in April
1940 on Herman Arnold's farm, while the holotype was found later that
year "three quarters of a mile east on the land of Mr. W. P. Cochran"
(Stovall and Langston, 1950).  They first attributed to remains to
the undivided Trinity Sands.  The holotype's skull length was
first estimated at 896 mm but NCSM 14345 shows it has a longer snout
than their Figure 2 and scaled to preorbital bar height it would have
been closer to 966 mm.  They state "The tenth presacral vertebra
is provisionally identified as the first dorsal", but since "The
parapophyses are set low on the sides of the centrum" it is here
identified as a tenth cervical.  Subsequent dorsal number
identifications by those authors have also been reduced by one here to
result in thirteen dorsals.  The authors wrote "The estimated
length of the femur in the paratype is 1153 mm", but their table on
page 720 lists this length for the smaller holotype.  Using the
complete right femur of SMU 74646 to estimate the holotype's femoral
length from its distal transverse width results in ~949 mm, while the
paratype's distal tibia width being 111% larger would give its femur an
estimated length of ~1.052 m.  Note in the 1980s the The Museum of
the University of Oklahoma changed its name to the Oklahoma Museum of
Natural History, and the types were given OMNH numbers to replace their
original MUO numbers. While Currie and Carpenter (2000) claimed "A more
detailed description of the braincase of the holotype has been prepared
by Welles et al." and cited an in prep. paper, with Welles having died
in 1997 and Langston in 2013, this is unlikely to ever be published.
The braincase was CT scanned in 1999 however, and the endocast
described by Franzosa and Rowe (2005).  They believed "the fact
that the exoccipital-basioccipital sutures are still unfused suggests
that the specimen was not fully adult."  Currie and Carpenter
wrote that unlike the large posterior surangular foramen reported by
Stovall and Langston in the holotype, "it is relatively small (diameter
of 12 mm) in NCSM 14345, where this region is better preserved." 
D'emic et al. (2012) found in the holotype the "anterior part of the
fibular thin section reveals 12 LA  arranged somewhat unevenly
throughout the outer half of the cortex, and a further nine closely
spaced LAG representing an EFS. Up to 12 LAG may be unaccounted for, as
LAG are not visible in the interior half of the fibular cortex due to
remodeling and the presence of the medullary cavity" and that "The EFS
is interpreted as evidence that this individual was skeletally
mature."  <br>
Nydam et al. (1997) recorded <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus
atokensis</span>
from the McLeod Prison site, later published as Cifelli et al. (1997)
that shows this is OMNH site V706.  The remains are likely to be
OMNH 34878 or 61249.<br>
Lipka (1998) lists "a cast of a partial acrocanthosaur lateral tooth,
OMNH 51788, from the Antlers Formation, site V708", which is in Atoka
County according to the OMNH online catalog.<br>
Pittman
(1989) wrote "A recently discovered specimen from Oklahoma
includes the complete skull and jaws, and much of the postcranial
skeleton, including most of the right pes. This specimen is in private
hands and is not currently available for study."  Lipka (1998)
followed this up with "A fourth acrocanthosaur skeleton from the
Antlers Formation of Oklahoma is now known. Until recently it had been
in private hands, and little is known about it except that it is nearly
complete and still under study."  As stated by Currie and
Carpenter (2000) "Parts of another specimen
(two posterior cervical or anterior dorsal centra, ischial fragment,
distal end of a femur), described in this paper, were collected by the
Oklahoma Museum of Natural History and were catalogued as OMNH 10168.
Most of the specimen, however, was collected by Cephis Hall &amp; Sid
Love, who retrieved the skull, about two dozen vertebrae, ribs,
chevrons, most of the front limbs, pelvic fragments, parts of both
femora and tibiae, and most of the bones of the foot. ... The
unprepared specimen was eventually acquired by Allen Graffham of
Geological Enterprises, Inc., Ardmore, Oklahoma, who in turn arranged
for the Black Hills Institute in Hill City, South Dakota, to prepare
the specimen. The preparation was completed at the end of the summer of
1996, and the original skeleton went the following year to the North
Carolina State Museum of Natural Sciences" as NCSM 14345.  It was
described in moderate detail by Currie and Carpenter in that
paper.  Carrano
(1998) includes measurements of this specimen as "Geol.
Enterprises".  Currie and Carpenter used Anderson's femoral
circumference method to estimate its mass as 2.40 tons.  The
intermedium was misidentified by Currie and Carpenter as the
ulnare.  Senter and Robins (2005) note that NCSM 14345 does not
include manual phalanges II-2 or III-3, manual ungual III, or the tips
of manual unguals I and II. These were illustrated and described by
Currie and Carpenter based on casts made by BHI personnel.  They
state "The fourth toe is missing the last two
phalanges" but all phalanges are illustrated in their Figure 14. 
D'Emic et al. (2012) determined using histology that "this individual
had just reached skeletal maturity after a lifetime of relatively
continuous growth."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Wyoming specimens</span>- Discovered
in 1963 and initially referred to ?Megalosauridae by Ostrom
(1970), D'Emic et al. (2012) reported regarding YPM 5377 "The size of
this tooth (ca. 8 cm long) resembles those of adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>"
and that it "is also similar to teeth referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus
atokensis</span> in that it exhibits fine denticulation (11-16
denticles/5 mm;
Harris, 1998b; Smith et al., 2005) and comparable proportions", thus
"This tooth likely pertains to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>."<br>
D'Emic
et al. (2012) described UM 20796, collected in 2008, noting "The bones
were found adjacent to the scapulocoracoid of a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauroposeidon proteles</span>
(UM 20800...)".  Using histology they concluded "Four lines of
arrested growth are visible in the cortex ..., suggesting an age of at
least four years for the specimen. This is a minimum estimate, because
resorption could have resulted in loss of some lines of arrested
growth."  D'Emic et al. wrote "Using the equation of Christiansen
and Fariña (2004), the best estimate body mass of UM 20796 at death was 657
kg", while Carrano (2024) estimated a mass of 502 kg "using the
biped formula from Campione et al. (2014)."  They also stated
"Other
materials that likely pertain
(but cannot be formally referred) to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus
atokensis</span>
from the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming include: YPM 5377, a tooth from
site YPM 63-19 near Lovell, Wyoming; YPM 5285, a caudal vertebra from
site YPM 64-59 near Bridger, Montana; and UM 20797, a partial
scapulocoracoid from near site YPM 63-17 near Lovell."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Utah specimens</span>- The first
supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
remains from Utah were two teeth and tooth fragments from the Long Walk
Quarry in the Lower Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mounatin Formation
reported by DeCourten (1990), who said "it is not possible to identify
the owner of the teeth with precision, but a good candidate seems to be
a dinosaur like <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>,"
... which lived "in Texas about the same time the Long Walk Quarry
sediments were deposited in Utah, was about the same size, and almost
certainly had teeth of the same general form. For now, we can only
refer to this dinosaur as<span style="font-style: italic;">
Acrocanthosaurus(?)</span>."  Kirkland et al. (1997) say "Kirkland
and Parrish (1995) suggested that
the teeth of the Long Walk Quarry theropod are distinct from <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> in that they are
much more coarsely serrated", but as the latter meeting abstract only
says that "cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>"
is part of the middle (Ruby Ranch) fauna perhaps this detail was only
in the associated poster.  However, Kirkland et al. also mention <i>cf.
Acrocanthosaurus sp.</i>
as being present in the Ruby Ranch  Member, which Harris (1998)
explains "is in reference to an isolated tooth (CEU 5107) with very
fine serrations from the Cedar Mountain Formation near the
Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry (J. Kirkland, personal comm.,
1998)."  Carpenter et al. (2001) mention this find when they say
"The CEU Prehistoric Museum has located a number of other important
sites at the same stratigraphic horizon in the area (Price River
[PR]-2, PR-3, etc.) that have produced ... elements identifiable as
coming from the large theropod <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>." 
Kirkland et al. (2016) more recently mentioned "A large tooth from PR-3
(Utah Em273) [that] has extremely fine serrations for a tooth that size
and seems to be closest to the older genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>." 
Note the College of Eastern Utah merged with Utah State University
creating Utah State University Eastern in 2010 and Utah Em273 is a
locality number for the latter, and Price River 3 is close to
Cleveland-Lloyd so this is almost certainly the tooth first mentioned
almost two decades earlier.  As Kirkland et al. state "the Price
River Quarries ... have been excavated since the 1990s", CEU 5107 was
discovered between 1990 and 1997.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arizona tooth</span>- The sauropod
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span> began to be
excavated in Spring 1995 in the Turney Ranch
Formation of Arizona, and in 1997 Ratkevich wrote "A single carnosaur
tooth similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(Fig. 7) was found in the quarry and appears to match bite marks found
on the radius and ulna of our skeleton."  Figure 7 is labeled
"Carnosaur tooth cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
found with the tooth-scared bones of "Sonorasaurus". Length 2.25
inches" showing a tooth in situ.  In his official description of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>, Ratkevich (1998)
mentions "Multiple long bones clearly
exhibit evidence of slash marks from a contemporary carnosaur. The
discovery of an <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
tooth associated with the bones allows us to identify at least one of
the flesh-eating species of the Turney Ranch Formation, and may help
account for the relative rarity of ribs, and other skeletal elements,
some of which were likely carried off by this and other
scavengers."  However, Scarborough (2000) found "The tooth of a
theropod dinosaur tentatively identified as similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(Figure 5; R. McCord, pers. comm., 1999), was recovered from a block of
quarry discard which has very similar lithology as this massive
sandstone bed ["one meter below the bone bed" of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>].
The strata immediately surrounding the bone bed contain no similar
green claystone clasts, leading to the likelihood that the tooth was
not directly associated with the dinosaur bone bed, but is one meter
beneath, making its association with <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>
questionable."  His Figure 5 is
lebeled "Tooth recovered from a sandstone bed about one meter below the
bone bed, tentatively identified as close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>, (#500-330, 55 mm
long) with 11 serrations per centimeter."  "most
likely position of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(?) tooth" is shown in his
Figure 2 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>
quarry. McCord and Gillette (2005) noted this as "a theropod tooth,
closely agreeing with and here referred to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>". 
D'Emic et al. (2016) noted "This tooth was further prepared in 2013"
and are thus able to give its Crown Base Length and Crown Base
Width.  Furthermore, they find serration "density can be measured
on the apical part of the distal margin (density=2 denticles/mm), about
the mid-height of the distal margin (2.8 denticles/mm), and mid-height
of the mesial margin (3.4 denticles/mm)", which in the
now standard metric equals 10, 14 and 17 per 5 mm respectively. 
This largely falls into the known range of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(11.5-17.5
distal, 10-20 mesial) and also suggests Scarborough's measurement of 11
serrations was actually per 5 mm, not 1 cm as he wrote.  D'Emic et
al. also find "The lateral profile of the tooth when viewed lingually
or labially is weakly sigmoid in outline with a concave basal and
convex apical portion, which was suggested to be diagnostic of
Carcharodontosaurinae (Hendrickx et al., 2015).  Based on this
feature, the denticle density, and overall proportions, we refer this
tooth to Carcharodontosaurinae."  It's figured as
"Carcharodontosaurinae indet., theropod dinosaur tooth (ASDM 330) from
the mid-Cretaceous Turney Ranch Formation of Arizona,
USA."  Scarborough gave the number as 500-330, but as D'Emic et
al. say "All bones of the [<span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>]
holotype fall under the number ASDM 500", perhaps suggesting 330 was
removed from 500
after Scarborough theorized it derived from a different level of the
quarry than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>. 
Oswald and Curtice (2023) include this
tooth in their SVP poster, where they call it ASDM 500:330.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Texas specimens</span>- Langston
(1974) mentioned "a postorbital bone from Wise County, Texas" as <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>,
and in Carnosauria "a femur a little more than one meter long obtained
from Cretaceous gravels near Bowie, Montague County, Texas. Its size
would suggest <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>." 
He figured a tooth as "Carnosaur, Paluxy Formation. Montague County,
Texas (FMNH-PR965)."<br>
SMU 62271 were said to be similar to <i>Allosaurus</i>, so are
provisionally assigned to <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> here based on
provenance.<br>
Regarding SMU 74646, Currie and Carpenter (2000) noted that "the
specimen was actually noticed for the first time more than 40 years
earlier" than 1990.  It was described in detail by Harris (1998a).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Arundel <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>?</span> Lipka was
the first author to suggest the presence of  <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
in the Arundel fauna, with Harris (1998b) noting "Large, isolated
theropod teeth from the Arundel are reportedly (T. Lipka, personal
communication, 1997) virtually identical to those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>..." 
Lipka (1998) announced "carnosaur-like teeth [that] now include recent
additions by myself (USNM 497718, 497722, 497723, 497724, 497725 and
497726) and others."  These teeth were all found in 1998, and
while briefly described (but not figured) by Lipka who concludes "It
thus seems nearly certain that <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
is indicated by the available tooth material", little evidence was
given to support their assignment to the genus.  Instead Lipka
vaguely stated "In general, USNM 497725 compares closely with SMU 74646
1-1", "USNM 497724 ... compares closely to OMNH 51788", "USNM 487723
... more closely resembles the Antlers tooth [OMNH 51788]".  The
only statement close to involving actual character evidence is "In most
other respects of gross denticle morphology (denticle sizes were not
measured but compared visually) and denticle count (~ 12/cm). USNM
497725 appears to exhibit many of the other features discussed above",
referring to seven dental features here listed under the comments
section "Does <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
have diagnostic teeth?" below.  Photos from the USNM online
catalog suggest a typo and that Lipka meant to write "~ 12 / 5 mm" in
regard to serration density, which also matches Harris' third
acrocanthosaur dental feature more closely.  Brownstein (2018)
figured three "teeth assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(2-4)" in his Figure 1, which can be identified via the USNM online
catalog as USNM 497722, 497723 and 497724 respectively.  He also
figures "a manual ungual possibly assignable to the latter allosaur in
?lateral (5) view" which is part of USNM 535490.  The latter was
discovered on March 24, 1999 and also includes a carnosaur-style tooth
and what may be the pubic peduncle of a maniraptoran ilium. 
Carrano (2024) stated the presence of "(1) the mesial margin of the
rounded denticles on the mesial carina is subrectangular, with a
flattened surface [character 89], and (2) the mesiodistal axis of the
mid-crown denticles on the distal carina is inclined apically from the
distal margin in lateral view [character 96]" that were found to be
locally diagnostic to the genus by Hendrickx and Mateus (2014)
"indicates that several isolated teeth from the Arundel Clay could
pertain to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>,
including USNM 5685, 442520, 497724, 497725, 529426, and 540719; I
assign these to ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
sp."  USNM 5685 is notable as a referred specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">"Allosaurus" medius</span>
by Lull (1911) that was discovered by Hatcher between October, 1887 and
January, 1888 based on Appendix C in Kranz (1996).  Lull says "one
[tooth] ... (No. 5685, Goucher
College) shows decided wear", but Gilmore (1920) correctly notes
this was "Wrongly attributed to Goucher College as this is the catalog
number
of the U. S. National Museum" and this remains true today.  Chure
(2000) repeated this error.  Lipka (1998) incorrectly states "Lull
(1911b) also reported two other larger crowns under GC 5685" as only
one tooth was reported, matching the catalog.  The USNM online
catalog indicates USNM 442520 is actually a turtle shell element from
the Pliocene Yorktown Formation of North Carolina, with Carrano
meaning Arundel theropod tooth USNM 442510 discovered in 1989 (Carrno-
pers. comm. 9-2024).  USNM
529426 and 540719 were discovered in 2005 and between 2010-2013
respectively.<br>
Martin and Brett-Surman (1992 unpublished) first reported a USNM
specimen described as "the proximal end of a left tibia, a pedal
phalange [sic] and an ungual" that was said to "still [be] in
preparation
and ha[d] not been cataloged" yet.  Identified only as "a
medium-sized
theropod", "the tibia of this specimen resembles those of ornithomimids
and the Late Cretaceous form <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus
aquilunguis</span>." 
The tibia, pedal phalanx III-2 and pedal ungual II were figured as
"Theropod."  Kranz (1996) reported he discovered this in May 1992,
describing the associated remains as "lower leg bones and ribs from
what has been tentatively identified as a large ornithomimid or
"ostrich" dinosaur."  Weishampel and Young (1996) wrote "the top
of a
left tibia (fig. 7.7) and a number of toe bones (including one of the
claws) - probably came from an animal 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet)
long" and proposed "Among theropods, the only ones that have flat claws
on the feet and a tibia that has a large crest sticking out the front
are ornithomimosaurs. These are the same features found in the new
Arundel theropod and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus
affinis</span>, so it is reasonable to
conclude that they too are ornithomimosaurs."  They concluded the
specimen "perhaps should be called <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ornithomimus"
affinis</span>." 
Brownstein
(2018) stated "Gilmore (1920) noted that more material from Arundel
ornithomimosaurs, including a partial tibia, phalanx and pedal ungual
(USNM PAL 466054) had been recovered (Figure 3.1)", referring to this
same specimen and figuring the tibia (incorrectly stated to be in
medial
view- actually lateral) but as Carrano (2024) rightfully stated
"the date of discovery precludes this specimen having been discussed in
Gilmore."  Carrano first reported that "Comparative study reveals
that
USNM 466054 is not an ornithomimosaur, but the first Arundel material
that can be confidently identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>." 
He
stated
"Between 1988 and 1997, several other theropod specimens were
discovered in close proximity to the location of USNM 466054. Although
some might pertain to the same individual, they could not be
definitively associated with it are not formally included here" and
exactly which USNM material this refers to has not been
published. 
Note the USNM online catalog lists this as being from locality USNM
41615, but Carrano (pers. comm. 7-2024) has confirmed that in the
catalog "for
the moment the two numbers are effectively equivalent."  Although
his materials list identifies the figured dorsal as the
second, in the description Carrano is less certain, stating "I
interpret it as pertaining
to dorsal vertebra 2 or 3."  Note he identifies two elements as
"right
pedal phalanges III-2 and -3 (or -3 and -4)" but the second could not
be III-4 as that would be an ungual which this second element is
not.  The description identifies
these
as III-1 and III-2.  Also while his materials list includes "right
pedal unguals II–IV" the description states "Three pedal unguals are
present (Fig. 10), two from the right side and one probably from the
left" with Figure 10 indicating III is the probable left element. 
Histologically, Carrano found the "data indicate a minimum age of 5-6
years based on LAGs (though certainly several are missing), and an
animal still undergoing significant growth based on the lack of an
EFS", while size-wise "The available cross-sectional dimensions of the
femur can be used to calculate body mass according to the formula of
Campione et al. (2014), producing an estimated body mass of 204
kg."  I estimated its length here as about seven meters, scaling
the six long bone lengths in Carrano's Table 1 to NCSM 14345 and
averaging them to result in 60.3% of the latter's size.  This may
be an overestimate however considering general allometric trends in
theropod ontogeny give younger animals longer feet.  Carrano noted
that of Weishampel and Young's supposed
ornithomimosaur
characters, that clade does not have notably large cnemial crests,
ventrally flat pedal unguals are typical of non-maniraptoran theropods,
and that furthermore "Distinct from ornithomimosaurs, the pedal unguals
of USNM 466054 lack the ventral “table” and exhibit a low flexor
tubercle rather than medial ventral ridges or fossae."  He also
noted
"The anteroposterior narrowness of these [dorsal] neural arches
corresponds well to those of large-bodied theropods such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
(Gilmore, 1920; Madsen, 1976), <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
(Harris, 1998),
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> (Coria and Currie,
2006) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
(Brochu, 2003)
... unlike the condition in ornithomimosaurs", "an anterior tilt of the
arch relative to the horizontal plane is also visible in the anterior
dorsals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> (SMU 74646/FWMSH
93B-9;
Harris, 1998), but not the other large-bodied theropods mentioned
above", "Like most allosauroids, the accessory trochanter is distinct
and approximately triangular. The femoral head is elevated and an
oblique articular groove is lacking from its dorsal surface, as in
carcharodontosaurids and megaraptorans ... [It] differs from that of
ornithomimosaurs, which have a horizontally oriented head, and greater
and lesser trochanters that are well separated by a deep incisure whose
depth reaches at least to the ventral margin of the head", and in the
tibia "The lateral proximal condyle is lobular, similar to the
condition in <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>,
carcharodontosaurids, and
megaraptorans." 
Finally, "USNM 466054 also possesses one autapomorphy of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus atokensis</span>: a
pointed (i.e., medially narrowing)
femoral head in dorsal view."  Carrano "consider[ed] the current
fossil sample of this lineage - in terms of both spatiotemporal density
and specimen completeness - to be insufficient to allow distinguishing
from <span style="font-style: italic;">A. atokensis</span>
(effectively the terminal “node” of the lineage) and
other taxa that might be more closely related to it than to other known
allosauroids (effectively the “stem” of the lineage). Therefore I have
chosen a slightly more ambiguous designation to allow for the
possibility that this specimen might represent another member of the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> lineage" and
so referred to it as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">A. atokensis</span>". 
However I have a more lumping taxonomic
philosophy where given the presence of an autapomorphy and absence of
noted differences, paired with rough stratigraphic equivalence, Arundel
acrocanthosaur specimens are most usefully treated as <span style="font-style: italic;">A. atokensis</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Does <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
have diagnostic teeth?</span>
The first teeth associated with an <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
specimen are those
in SMU 74646 described by Harris (1998a), who as Lipka (1998) said
"noted features on these two teeth that may prove to be diagnostic for
acrocanthosaurs, which are: 1) small size of denticulation with respect
to the overall size of the tooth, 2) denticle counts of just under 11
denticles per 5 mm midway down each keel, 3) cartouche-shaped distal
denticles with slightly compressed bodies at their bases and denticle
axes perpendicular to the axis of the distal keel, 4) distal denticles
slightly larger (0.6 mm) than mesial denticles (0.5 mm), 5) mesial
denticles are parallelogram-shaped with axes inclined with respect to
the mesial keel becoming more inclined toward the tip, 6)
denticles decrease in size towards the tip, and 7) "apical
denticulation:" contiguous keels with denticles continuing over the
tip."  However, the subsequently described complete skull of NCSM
14345 with most dental positions preserved shows a larger variation in
serration density (10-19 per 5 mm mesially, 11.5-17.5 distally) and
DSDI (0.66-1.57).  Currie and Carpenter (2000) also stated apical
denticulation "is the same situation in a diverse assemblage of
theropods that includes carcharodontosaurids, velociraptorine
dromaeosaurids, and tyrannosaurids, so this feature has limited
taxonomic utility."  Hendrickx and Mateus (2014) recovered two
characters as local apomorphies of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
teeth- "(1) the mesial margin of the rounded denticles on the mesial
carina is subrectangular, with a flattened surface [character 89], and
(2) the mesiodistal axis of the mid-crown denticles on the distal
carina is inclined apically from the distal margin in lateral view
[character 96]" (Carrano, 2024). <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships</span>- Stovall and
Langston (1950) stated "the construction of the skull, the general
proportions of the vertebrae, and the broadly expanded pubic "foot,"
the straight elongate shaft of the ischium, and the presence of an
anterior upward projection in the anterior chevrons ... together with
the geographic consideration, seem sufficiently important at present to
justify the incorporation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
into the family Antrodemidae" instead of Megalosauridae when these were
the only two Jurassic carnosaur (sensu Huene) families recognized
(contra Currie and Carpenter, 2000 who stated it "was assigned to the
Allosauridae" by its describers). Currie and Carpenter found <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
to be an allosaurid, but of their thirteen characters supporting this,
at least four are primitive (promaxillary and maxillary fenestrae;
axial intercentrum subparallel to axis ventral margin; paired anterior
and posterior processes at base of chevrons; pubic foramen present in
distal pubis), three are also found in <i>Giganotosaurus</i>
(basioccipital participates in basal tubera; distal ends of
paroccipital processes below foramen magnum; internal carotid opening
pneumatized), one in <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> (separation of
trigeminal nerve branches complete), and five aren't known in <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
or <i>Giganotosaurus</i> (long basipterygoid processes; reduced
external mandibular fenestra; pronounced notch between acromion and
coracoid; sigmoidal humerus; metacarpal IV absent). So there are
actually no characters published by Currie and Carpenter that support
placing <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> in the Allosauridae. <i>Giganotosaurus</i>
and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> are clearly more closely related to
each other than <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
is to either, but there's no reason to believe the latter is not
carcharodontosaurid. Franzosa and Rowe (2005) concluded "Characters
such as the division of the olfactory bulbs and tracts by a mesethmoid,
which occurs in <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>.
<span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurs</span> [sic], and <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>, but not in <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>,
help to strengthen the postulated relationships."  When
constrained as an allosaurid in Carrano et al.'s (2012) tetanurine
matrix, it takes 12 additional steps, showing this topology is indeed
improbable.<br>

"about 300 meters NN.W. from the military post at Chingkangsao near a
local town called Sungkan, 43 km from the northern gate of Tungtze
Hsien right along the Chungking-Kweiyang High Way."  Sungkan town
is now Songkanzhen, Tungtze Hsien is now Tongzi County, and the
Chongqing-Guiyang Highway is China National Highway 210 (G210). 
Young stated it was "found from the basal part of the Cretaceous Beds,
lying about 150 meters above the contact with the Jurassic Beds." 
While no other Cretaceous fossils have been reported in Tongzi County
(besides "a corprolite of fish" associated with IVPP V361), about 54 km
north is the Lotus tracksite placed in the Jiaguan Formation, which is
also where tracksites 95 km further southwest in Guizhou like Baoyuan
are assigned.  This may be the most appropriate assignment for the
Songkanzhen locality as both it and Baoyuan are equally separated from
the main Sichuan Basin.  <br>
Young assigned IVPP V361 to Sauropoda gen. et sp. indet. based on its
large size, "the shape of the centrum, the massiveness of the neural
arch and the dorsal spine", considering it a posteriormost dorsal based
on "the weak opisthocoelus character of the centrum [untrue, actually
amphicoelous] and the anterior position of the pleuro-central cavity,
the shortness of the diapophyses as well as the poor development or
disappearence of some laminae."  Noting the neural spine was quite
unlike any known sauropod including Chinese forms (<span style="font-style: italic;">Omeisaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tienshanosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Euhelopus</span>), Young proposed the most
similarity to "posterior dorsal vertebrae of <span style="font-style: italic;">Apatosaurus louisae</span>
[which] show a rather flat appearence in the anterior end of the
centrum, low position of the diapophyses and even the dorsal spine of
the dorsal vertebra no. nine shows broader and thicker tip, (but not
anticlinal), but the prominent anterior and posterior as well as the
lateral ridges preventing any further companson."  He concluded
"very probably that we have to do with a new peculiar Sauropod." 
More recently, Averianov and Sues (2017) proposed "The simple,
paddle-shaped neural spine of the anterior caudal [in <span style="font-style: italic;">Qingxiusaurus</span>]
resembles that of an isolated sauropod vertebra from the Cretaceous of
the neighboring Guizhou Province (Young, 1948), which may belong to the
same or a closely related taxon."  Identification of the isolated
element in <span style="font-style: italic;">Qingxiusaurus</span> as a
caudal neural spine notwithstanding, it strongly differs from IVPP V361
in narrowing transversely from near its apex to a very slender base,
being dorsoventrally convex anteriorly in lateral view, having a
transversely flat posterior surface, and having a postspinal lamina at
its base.  <br>
Mortimer (online 2015) noted a resemblence to the axis of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> in the "spoon-like
neural spine ... [and] lack of neural spine laminae", which will be
elaborated upon here.  Unlike the <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
specimen (SMU 74646 3B-1), the axial intercentrum and odontoid are not
fused to the axis in IVPP V361, which explains the absent parapophyses
are these are on the intercentrum in <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>. 
The centra are similar in shape with pleurocoels in the same position
(note the absence of illustrated foramina in Young's specimen may only
indicate preparation was incomplete as the neural canal is drawn as if
filled as well) and a median ventral keel.  The "protuberance
directing posteriorly and overhanging the anterior part of the
pleuro-central cavity, a feature also not observed in other Sauropods"
corresponds to the diapophysis in <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>. 
Young's "A. L., accessory lamina (probably infraprezygapophysial
lamina)" that runs ventrolaterally in anterior view is like the
intraprezygapophyseal lamina in <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>. 
The supposed diapophyses are postzygapophyses mostly composed of their
epipophyses, much of which has been broken off.  The neural spines
are both very tall and saddle-shaped (anterior edge concave in lateral
view, anterior surface transversely convex, posterior surface
transversely concave) with no laminae, an anterior median ridge and
thickened edges apically.  Differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
include a shallower ventral median concavity on the centrum in lateral
view, a taller neural arch between the centrum and neural spine,
smaller postzygapophyses angled ventrally, a more vertical neural spine
and a larger projection (of the interspinous ligament?) located at the
anterior base of the neural spine.  Other differences are less
clear due to the damage and distortion of IVPP V361, such as the
supposed fossa between what would be the centropostzygapophyseal and
postzygodiapophyseal laminae, and the basally compressed postspinal
fossa.  Perhaps the greatest problem with IVPP V361 being a
theropod axis is its size, being 83% longer than SMU 74646 3B-1 (whose
axis minus the intercentrum and odontoid is about 82 mm) with a centrum
85% wider posteriorly.  This leads to a total length estimate of
18 meters based on scaling SMU 74646 femoral length to more complete <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> skeleton NCSM

Of the two other elements described, the sacral characters are not
sufficient to distinguish theropod from sauropod.  The
appendicular fragment is figured in two views and interpreted as a
distal sauropod pubis.  If it is a theropod element instead, a
pelvic identification still seems most likely.  One possibility is
a proximal ischium with the shorter articular surface being a pubic
peduncle, the grooved surface being acetabular as occurs in some
theropods, and the small area at the top of the figure being the ilial
peduncle.  If so, <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
differs in having a distinct ilial peduncle, a convex posterior edge to
the ilial peduncle, and more concave edges to the pubic peduncle and
acetabulum.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis-</b> (after Hu, 1964) twelve maxillary teeth.<br>
(after Chure, 1998) paradental groove on medial surface of maxilla
absent; large cylindrical pneumatic cavity in posterior nasals; deep
sagittal crest on frontals and parietals.<br>
(after Chure, 2000) no maxillary palatal shelf; absent distal quadrate
groove.<br>
(after Brusatte et al., 2009) maxillary antorbital fossa reduced in
extent and nearly absent; deep, dorsoventrally oriented grooves located
dorsally on maxillary interdental plates; large pneumatic foramen at
anterodorsal corner of dorsal tympanic recess of prootic.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hu (1964) also diagnosed <i>maortuensis</i> by
its large occipital condyle (compared to the foramen magnum), which is
similar to other carcharodontosaurids. His last two characters- small
skull and small quadrate, are too vague to evaluate.<br>
Of the supposedly diagnostic characters listed by Chure (1998), the
fused maxillary interdental plates, anteriorly limited supratemporal
fossae, declined paroccipital processes and highly pneumatized and
shortened basicranium are typical of carcharodontosaurids. Contra
Chure, a paraquadrate foramen was present, and the maxillary
interdental plates are not small.<br>
Chure (2000) listed additional diagnostic characters, including ones
that are typical of carcharodontosaurids- thick, flat frontals;
subnarial process of frontals forms a deep trough; short axis. The
frontals aren't unfused and the axial neural spine is
posterodorsally inclined.<br>
<b>Comments-</b> The material was discovered in 1960. Hao et al. (2024 online) note the neds at Maortu "were mistakenly claimed to  belong to "Wulanhushao (Suhongtu) Formation" (Vickaryous et al., 2001), "Dashuigou  Formation" (Weishampel et al., 2004) and "Ulansuhai Formation" (Brusatte et al., 2009;  Weishampel et al., 2004). However, this fossil-bearing unit ... actually belongs to the Miaogou Formation, which  incorporated the formerly abandoned Dashuigou Formation and Wulanhushao  Formation (report of Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources of Nei Mongol  Autonomous Region, 1991; Gao et al., 2014)." Hu (1964)
placed this and <i>Chilantaisaurus tashuikensis</i> in the same genus
based on dental and caudal similarities. The caudals of <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>
are only doubtfully referred and belong to the proximal part of the
series, while those of <i>Shaochilong </i>are more distal. Also, the
tooth of <i>Chilantaisaurus</i> is similarly doubtfully referred and
comparison with the exposed tooth of <i>Shaochilong</i> is not useful.
Because of this, Chure (1998) separated the two species, and later
(2000) created a new genus for <i>maortuensis</i> in his unpublished
thesis- "Alashansaurus" (incorrectly spelled "Alshansaurus" by Brusatte
et al., 2010). The name was published by Glut (2003), but the latter
reference includes a caveat to prevent it from being an official
taxonomic source, leaving the possibility of Chure being its official
describer once his thesis' contents are published. This happened in
2009, when Chure coauthored Brusatte et al. (2009), naming the genus <i>Shaochilong</i>
instead. <br>
After Hu's assignment to the Megalosauridae, Molnar (1974) noted
frontal and quadrate similarities to <i>Labocania</i>. Both Paul
(1988) and Molnar et al. (1990) assigned it to a paraphyletic
Allosauridae, closer to tyrannosaurids than <i>Allosaurus</i>. Chure
(1998) noted it shared characters with <i>Labocania</i>, tyrannosaurs,
troodontids and dromaeosaurids. He later (2000) assigned it to Holtz's
tyrannosaur + ornithomimosaur + troodontid clade based on the
proximolateral ischial scar in the supposedly related <i>Labocania</i>,
and to
the Tyrannosauroidea based on the highly pneumatized basicranium and
short and deep braincase. Chure found it sister to <i>Labocania</i>
based on "a thick frontal, a lack of a helical groove on the ventral
articular surface of the quadrate, and very slight invasion of the
frontals by the supratemporal fenestra." Brusatte et
al. (2009) entered it into Smith et al.'s (2007) matrix, finding it to
be a carcharodontosaurid outside of Carcharodontosaurinae and related
to <i>Tyrannotitan</i>. 
More recently, Rauhut et al. (2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group
Theropod Matrix to recover it as a tyrannosauroid outside Megaraptora
plus Eutyrannosauria (note the supplementary information shows a more
precise position was recovered than suggested in Figure 25).<br>

?(MB R coll.) thirteen teeth, tooth fragments<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Though Janensch (1925) referred 13 more teeth and
tooth fragments to the taxon, these are excluded by Rauhut (2011) as
not sharing the exact same combination of characters. Rauhut did note
there are Tendaguru teeth that are similar except for the absence of
enamel wrinkles, which are individually variable in many other taxa.
While this species has been referred to both <i>Megalosaurus</i>
(Janensch, 1920) and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Paul, 1988), Rauhut (2011)
noted it differs from these taxa. Specifically, <i>Megalosaurus</i>
differs in having a more strongly recurved crown tip, finer serrations,
mesial serrations that ends well above the crown-root junction, and
lacks down-pointing grooves at the bases of the serrations. <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
also lacks the latter grooves, has strongly transversely flattened
crowns, pronounced flat or even slightly concave areas adjacent to the
carinae, and never shows enamel wrinkles. Rauhut (1995) noted
similarity with <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> in the interdenticle
grooves, and suggested it may be a carcharodontosaurid. He later (2011)
made the same suggestion, this time based on the combination of only
slightly recurved crowns, basally directed grooves at the base of the
serrations, mesial carina extends to the base of the crown, and
marginal, apically curved enamel wrinkles along the carinae. If so,
these characters are only shared with carcharodontosaurines within that
family. Note Madsen and Welles (2000) incorrectly attributed the
combination <i>Ceratosaurus ingens</i> to Rowe and Gauthier (1990) and
wrongly considered it a lapsus calumni, apparently unaware of Paul's
book. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- This tooth was described by Simionescu (1913) and
compared to <i>Erectopus</i> (then <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>).
Huene (1926) doubted it was the same species due to age differences,
but did continue to call it <i>Erectopus</i> aff. <i>superbus</i>.
Csiki-Sava et al. (2016) redescribed the specimen in detail and
determined it is strongly supported as a carcharodontosaurine and
resembles <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> more than giganotosaurines in two
characters- roughly straight distal margin of crown; pronounced
marginal undulations in enamel that are easily visible in normal light.<br>

protruding ventral margin of the maxillary external antorbital fossa;
deep and ventrally-facing fossa between<br>
the inner wall of the maxilla and the anteromedial process; deep and
dorsoventrally protruding lacrimal-frontal suture; invaginated
anteromedial corner of the supratemporal fossa; distinct enamel
wrinkles on both mesial and distal margins of mesial (anterior) and mid
maxillary crowns.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Megalosaurus saharicus</i> is based on two teeth
from the Albian Continental Intercalaire of Algeria (Deperet and
Sevornin, 1925). Huene (1956) listed <i>Megalosaurus africanus</i>,
incorrectly attributed to Deperet and Savornin (1925), but this is
probably a mistake. Note contra the Paleobiology Database (online 2006), Deperet and Savornin (1927) made <em>saharicus</em> a species of their <em>Megalosaurus</em> subgenus <em>Dryptosaurus</em>, not a species of the genus <em>Dryptosaurus</em>. Later, Stromer (1931) described a partial skeleton
found in 1914 from the Early Cenomanian Baharija Formation of Egypt and
referred it to this species, creating the genus <em>Carcharodontosaurus</em> for it. An incomplete skull from the Cenomanian Kem Kem beds of Morocco
closely resembling Stromer's specimen was found in 1995 and reported by
Sereno et al. (1996). Brusatte and Sereno (2007) noted <i>Giganotosaurus</i>
has identical teeth to <i>Carcharodontosaurus saharicus</i>, thus the
original <i>Megalosaurus saharicus</i> specimens are indeterminate. In
order to save <i>Carcharodontosaurus saharicus</i> from being a nomen
dubium, they made the incomplete Kem Kem skull the neotype of the
species (Stromer's material is destroyed). Since no diagnostic
differences have been noted between the teeth of <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
<i>saharicus</i> and <i>Giganotosaurus</i>, the referral of isolated
teeth to any particular derived carcharodontosaurid taxon is based
solely on locality. Chiarenza and Cau (2016) proposed the neotype
differs from the holotype in having ventrally flattened maxillary
interdental plates, but this seems to be due to damage in the neotype,
whose complete third interdental plate is ventrally pointed. <br>
The ilium (IPHG 1912 VIII 68) referred to <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
by Stromer (1934) does not necessarily belong to this taxon, and may be
ceratosaurian (?= <i>Deltadromeus</i> or <i>Bahariasaurus</i>).  
Russell (1996) described a maxillary fragment, cervical vertebra and
teeth from the Kem Kem beds of Morocco, which though closely resembling
those in Stromer's specimen, are only referred to the species <i>saharicus</i>
based on provenance. The same can be said for teeth from that locality
mentioned by Lavocat (1954) and Sadlier (1998), though Lavocat's teeth
were not only compared to <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>, but also
Tendaguru taxa and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, so may not be referrable to
carcharodontosaurids at all. The supposed maxillary fragment (CMN
41859) was described twice by
Russell, the second time as a dentary fragment of Abelisauridae gen. et
sp. indet..  Ibrahim (2011) agreed it was
actually carcharodontosaurid  based on "the deep proportions and
alveolar
morphology" (Ibrahim et al., 2020), with Ibrahim et al. (2017, 2020)
referring it to the coeval <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus
saharcus</span>.  Smith et al. (2001) reported new remains of <i>cf.
Carcharodontosaurus</i> from the Baharija Formation of Egypt. Sereno et
al. (1996) referred the specimen of <i>Spinosaurus</i> B and the
material of <i>Sigilmassasaurus</i> to <i>Carcharodontosaurus
saharicus</i>, but Ibrahim et al. (2014) have since demonstrated they
belong to <i>Spinosaurus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Sereno et al. (2004) noted carcharodontosaurids were
associated with <i>Rugops</i> in the Echkar Formation, and Brusatte
and Sereno (2005) briefly described the new species in an abstract. It
was named and described in detail by Brusatte and Sereno (2007). They
also referred a cervical centrum (MNN IG11) to the species, but it was
found loose from the ground and was too immature to belong to the same
individual as MNN IGU3. It is here referred to <i>Spinosaurus</i>, as
Ibrahim et al. (2014) demonstrated cervicals with that morphology
belong to that genus. Chiarenza and Cau (2016) noted the paratypes were
not found close to the holotype, and that the braincase MNN IGU3 lacks
several characters present in <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>+<i>Giganotosaurus</i>.
Furthermore, the two braincase characters proposed to diagnose <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
by Brusatte and Sereno are also present in <i>Giganotosaurus</i>. Thus
MNN IGU3 may be a non-carcharodontosaurine. <br>

<i>Bahariasaurus</i>, <i>Spinosaurus</i>, etc.). Over a hundred of the
teeth are carcharodontosaurid, however. Carcharodontosaurid material
may be referrable to <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> sp. nov., based on
provenance. A pedal ungual from In Abangarit referred to <i>C.
saharicus</i> by Lapparent matches the <i>Spinosaurus</i> B morphotype
that has been shown to be <i>Spinosaurus</i> by Ibrahim et al. (2014).
The carcharodontosaurid tooth fragment MNNHN Td. 2269 was described by
Lapparent as being from the younger Elrhaz Formation, but Taquet (1976)
notes it came from a cliff of Albian deposits.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Fanti et al. (2014) noted "all typical morphological features of
carcharodontosaurid teeth are identifiable in teeth included in
Morphotype 2, including large and moderately curved crowns, strong
labiolingual compression of the basal cross-section, and enamel
wrinkles flanking both serrated carinae", but found "similar
characteristics are observed in the teeth of the abelisaurid[s] <span style="font-style: italic;">Skorpiovenator</span>"
and MGUP MEGA002 from the Duwi Formation of Egypt, so assigned these
"to either a carcharodontosaurid or abelisaurid theropod."  They
resolved as abelisaurid when Fanti et al. added them to Hendrickx's
theropod dental matrix, but it would leave carcharodontosaurids
unrepresented in their 68 tooth Dahar sample, which seems
unlikely.  The caudal vertebra was assigned to
Carcharodontosauridae by Fanti et al. (2014).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This material was not found associated, so could

<i>Bahariasaurus</i>, <i>Spinosaurus</i>, etc.). Twelve teeth and a few mid caudal vertebrae from the <em>C. saharicus</em> syntype locality
of Timimoun were described by Lapparent (1960). The teeth are described as having
enamel wrinkles as in derived carcharodontosaurids and being very
similar to the holotype, though the caudals' referral is uncertain.
A manual ungual from
Dijoua referred to <i>C. saharicus</i> by Lapparent matches bone taxon
J of Russell (1996), identified as <i>Spinosaurus</i> by Ibrahim et
al. (2014). A distal metatarsal from Alrar referred to <i>C. saharicus</i>
by Lapparent is actually a manual phalanx and matches bone taxon I of
Russell. Russell notes it could belong to the same taxon as the ungual,
so this may be <i>Spinosaurus</i> as well. Finally, a pedal ungual
from Alrar referred to <i>C. saharicus</i> by Lapparent matches the <i>Spinosaurus</i>
B morphotype which has also been identified as <i>Spinosaurus</i> by

below the Duwi Formation."  Churcher's (1999) faunal list matches
this
with Bee's Friday Site, and says "Subsequently specimens assignable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Spinosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span> were obtained",
suggesting this was the theropod material mentioned in 1992.</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Canale et
al., 2022) maxillary fenestra; jugal stepped along posterior edge of
postorbital process (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>);
postorbital with a low and rounded lateral horn on the posterior
process; lacrimal with rounded projections along its dorsal margin
(unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>? and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>); sacral vertebral
neural spines almost completely co-ossified (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>; ontogenetic?); caudal
vertebrae 1-4 with hyposphene-hypantrum articulations (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>);
humerus with internal tuberosity separated from humeral head by a cleft
(unknown in other giganotosaurines); humerus with ovoid fossa on its
anteroproximal surface (unknown in other giganotosaurines); strongly
enlarged pedal ungual II, almost twice the length of pedal ungual IV
(unknown in other giganotosaurines).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- In addition to
the diagnostic postorbital and jugal caharcters retained
in its eventual description, Canale et al. (2018) also cite "proximal
caudal vertebrae with extensive pneumatic openings in the bases of the
neural spines above the postzygapophyses."  The description
indicates these are "wide and deep spinopostzygapophyseal fossae along
the posterior base of the neural spines, in the first five" and that "A
pair of foramina open into these fossae behind the
postzygapophyses."  As with the proximal caudal
hyposphene-hypantra, preserved caudals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span> are more distally
positioned and while <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>
might be assumed to lack them this remains undescribed.  <br>
Canale et al. (2022) also list "quadratojugal with a deep and rounded
fossa on its lateral surface", but this isn't visible in their figure
2A and the element is unpreserved in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span> in any
case.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 2012
and excavated from 2012 to 2014, this was first mentioned by Canale et
al. (2018) in an abstract as "A recently recovered specimen with
carcharodontosaurid affinities (MMCh-PV 65) from the Huincul Formation
(Cenomanian)."  They state some features "provide evidence for a
possible new taxon" and that "A preliminary phylogenetic analysis
recovers the specimen nested within Giganotosaurini."  Cullen et
al. (2020) call this the "Campanas carcharodontosaurid (unnamed
carcharodontosaurid taxon from the Huincul Formation of Argentina; MMCh
PV 65)" and figure sections of a rib, gastralium, femur and
fibula.  Palombi (2022) described the metatarsals in his thesis,
calling it "the holotype of a new species of Carcharodontosauridae
(MMCh-PV 65), which is currently under study" (translated). 
Canale et al. (2022) described the specimen as <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes gigas</span>,
and using Canale's carnosaur analysis recovered it as the basalmost
giganotosaurine.  Canale (pers. comm., 7-2002) confirms that in
the right hindlimb "we have fibula, calcaneum, metatarsals IV and V.
The digits of the right foot are incomplete, just some phalanges (five
preungual, two unguals)", which is not determinable in the publication.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Novas et al., 2005) some teeth with bilobate
denticles on mesial carina (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>).<br>
(after Canale et al., 2015) dentary with an
anteroventrally-posterodorsally symphyseal margin in lateral view
(unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>); second
and third dorsal vertebrae with well-developed accessory lamina
connecting anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae (unknown
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>);
fibular fossa extended far proximal to ectocondylar tuber on the distal
femur; anterior margin of proximomedial fibular fossa posteriorly
projected, covering part of the fossa.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Canale et al. (2015) noted the depth of the
Meckelian groove is similar to <i>Carcharodontosaurus? iguidensis</i>,
<i>Giganotosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i>, thus Novas et al.'s
(2005) deep Meckelian groove is invalid. Similarly, Canale et al. noted
the posterior dorsal neural spine ligament scars are equally well
developed in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i>Giganotosaurus</i> and <i>Mapusaurus</i>,
contra Novas et al..  Note both hindlimb characters listed above
should be scorable in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>
but are not determinable in its description.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The material was discovered in 1994 (Canale, pers. comm. 7-2022), with
the holotype
and paratype about 1 km apart.  Rich et al. (2000) preliminarily
described both as unnamed theropods, noting MPEF-PV 1157 may be
conspecific as "suggested by the presence of a bone fragment which
appears to be a heavily worn specimen of a neural spine with triangular
bosses like those on the neural spines of MPEF-PV 1156."  They
listed "a possible maxilla fragment" and "a partial ilium" in the
material of MPEF-PV 1157, which must have been misidentified. 
Novas et al. (2005) list three pedal phalanges as being present in the
holotype ("2.I, 2.II and 3.III"), but also illustrate an ungual
supposedly from digit II, which wouldn't correspond to any of these.
The skeletal reconstruction only shows two phalanges- ungual III and a
distal phalanx. Canale et al. (2015) reidentified the phalanges as
II-2, ungual II, IV-2 and IV-3. The supposed ulna was reidentified as a
radius and several presacral centra had revised positions in Canale et
al..  Based on comparison to <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>
and the small size of pedal ungual II compared to phalanx II-2 in
Canale et al.'s Figure 33, the pedal ungual is reassigned to digit IV.<br>
Note MPEF-PV 10821 are "isolated teeth found in this locality, which
are housed at the MPEF collections but have not been assigned to the
holotype or paratype" (Canale et al., 2015).<br>

<b>Late Cenomanian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Violante farm, Huincul Formation of Rio Limay Subgroup, Río Negro,
Argentina</b><br>
(MPCA PV 802; holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Taurovenator
violantei</span>) postorbital (Motta, Aranciaga Rolando, Rozadilla,
Agnolin, Chimento, Brisson Egli and Novas, 2016)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Coria and Currie, 2006) upper quadratojugal
process of jugal splits into two prongs (unknown in <i>Giganotosaurus</i>);
anterior mylohyoid foramen positioned above dentary contact on splenial
(unknown in other giganotosaurines); second and third metacarpals fused
(supposed carpometacarpus may be distal humerus; unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>); brevis fossa of
ilium extends deeply into excavation dorsal to ischial peduncle.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Coria and
Currie (2006) listed "humerus with broad distal end and little
separation between condyles", but this has since been found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span> and is unpreserved in other
giganotosaurines.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The type material comes from at least nine
individuals. Carrano et al. (2012) believe MCF-PVPH-108.48 is a distal
humerus and not a carpometacarpus as Coria and Currie (2006) described
it. While non-maniraptoriforms otherwise lack metacarpal fusion and it
does resemble a distal humerus, it differs from <i>Mapusaurus</i>
in having two bulbous condyles with a notch between them and a large
epicondyle, so may belong to another theropod. MCF-PVPH-108.220 was
described as a partial fibula by Coria and Currie, but reidentified as
a pathological dorsal rib by Bell and Coria (2013).  Coria and
Currie state the preserved pedal ungual (MCF-PVPH-108.198) "is
asymmetrical and was probably from either the second or fourth digits",
and based on its shortness and high degree of curvature it is here
identified as ungual IV using the complete pes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span> for comparison.<br>
This taxon was discovered in 1995, but only reported to Coria in 1997,
when he and Currie examined the material. It was announced at that
years Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, and described briefly
in an abstract (Coria and Currie, 1997). At the time, only the remains
of an 8 meter long specimen were known, and it was identified as an
adult. Coria and Currie returned to the site in 1998 to discover the
presence of at least six individuals, some of which Currie said could
be larger than <i>Giganotosaurus</i>’ holotype. The largest specimens
are MCF-PVPH-145, 185 and 202, which are about 100-103% the size of the
<i>Giganotosaurus</i> holotype.<br>
The association of several individuals was suggested to be due to pack
behavior. This was reported to the popular media in May 1999, and later
described in another abstract (Eberth et al., 2000). Currie and
Carpenter (2000) mention "new specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span> from Argentina" they
used to score the genus in their phylogenetic analysis, which in
hindsight are probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>. 
Later (Eberth and McCrea, 2001), the minimum number of individuals was
increased to eight. This paper finds the probable cause of death to be
drought and notes the bones experienced at least two flooding events
and were exposed and trampled over more than one season. However, they
state several alternatives exist besides gregarious behavior to explain
the find, including environmental stress and breeding. In the final
publication, Coria and Currie (2006) raised the minimum number of
individuals to nine. <br>
It was reported on the internet that a magazine had termed the taxon <i>Giganotosaurus</i>
"argentine", but this has yet to be confirmed and would be a nomen
nudum in any case. Fiorillo and Eberth (2004) used the name
"Mapusaurus" in their taphonomy chapter in The Dinosauria 2nd. edition,
probably by accident. Papolio (2004) listed it as "Mapusaurus rosae" in
a field guide.<br>
Motta et al. (2016) described the postorbital MPCA PV 802 as a new
carcharodontosauirine <span style="font-style: italic;">Taurovenator
violantei</span>.  They diagnosed it based on two characters-
"horn-like prominence on orbital brow of postorbital" is present but
less developed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>
lacrimal MCF-PVPH-108.177, as noted by Coria et al. (2019); while "deep
excavation in ventral surface of postorbital" was stated to be unknown
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> as "the region
in which the fossa should be housed is broken."  Yet the latter
seems to be illustrated as present by Coria and Currie (2006: Fig. 5D),
and indeed Coria et al. state it is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> and Canale et al. (2022)
find it is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>. 
Unsurprisingly, Coria et al. suggest <span style="font-style: italic;">Taurovenator</span>
is a junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>,
also noting they share a character Coria and Currie lists as
distinguishing the latter from <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>
("ventrolaterally curving lateral margin of palpebral") although this
was later revealed to be present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>
as well.  While <span style="font-style: italic;">Taurovenator</span>'s
type is smaller than MCF-PVPH-108.177 so might be expected to have a
less developed postorbital horn, interspecific variation in cranial
excrescences is common in theropods (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>).  Thus I
provisionally agree with the synonymy.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Coria and Salgado, 1995) dorsoventrally wide main body of
maxilla with subparallel dorsal and ventral edges (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>); two pneumatic
foramina on medial surface of quadrate (unreported in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>; unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>); lobe-shaped
obturator process.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Some
characters proposed by Coria and Salgado (1995) have since been
identified as diagnostic of all giganotosaurines and sometimes more
basal carcharodontosaurids- eave-like supraorbital lacrimal-postorbital
contact; symphyseal end of dentary dorsoventrally expanded, forming
ventral process; dorsally projected femoral head.  The posterior
intercondylar groove in the proximal tibia is present in most
theropods.  The tubercle-like insertion for triceps in the ventral
scapular edge is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span>
(but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span>; unknown
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannotitan</span>). 
Canale et al. (2015) noted the supposed scapula-coracoid suture is
actually a break in the coracoid, so that contra Coria and Salgado, the
proximal end of the scapula is not anteriorly projected above the
coracoid.  <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Carrano et al. (2012) report a femur length of 1.365 m
for the holotype and believe the skull to be less than 1.5 m long when
reconstructed correctly.  Canale et al. (2022) used the almost
complete skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Meraxes</span> to
estimate a skull length of 1.62 m for <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>'
holotype.  Coria and Currie (2006) state <span style="font-style: italic;">Mapusaurus</span> specimen
"MCF-PVPH-108.68 is a 1040 mm long tibia, which is 7% smaller than the
tibia of <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>" and
"MCF-PVPH-108.202 is an 860 mm long fibula that is actually 2 cm longer
than the fibula of the 12.2 m long <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>."<br>
The holotype was discovered in 1993 (Calvo, 1999) 12 km SW of El Chocon
and presented at the 1994 SVP by Coria and Salgado.  Contrary to
the eventual description, a premaxilla, incomplete jugal, quadratojugal
and astragalus were reported.  However, Eddy and Clarke (2011)
list the premaxilla as preserved as well as the ectopterygoid and
pterygoid.  Unfortunately only the braincase (Coria and Currie,
2002) and endocast (Carabajal and Canale, 2010) have been described and
figured in detail, and as most of the presacral column was unprepared
in 1995, the numbers of cervicals and dorsals listed here are based on
photos of the holotype laid out on display at the MMCH.  Note
that one tibia-fibula and the pedes in this display (as shown in Fig.
13 of Calvo, 1999) as well as the skull and forelimbs are artificial
however.  Hendrickx et al. (2014) figure the quadrate in all views
(mislabeled <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaochilong</span>in
the caption for Figure 11), Novas et al. (2013) figure the maxilla
and dentary, Eddy and Clarke (2011) figure the lacrimal and
ectopterygoid, and Calvo (1999) figures the scapulocoracoid (also in
Canale et al., 2015) and femur in medial view.  Canale et al.
(2015) noted the scapulocoracoid is actually damaged, so that the
scapula-coracoid suture, low acromion and unexpanded distal end are not
real features.  Papers such as Currie and Carpenter (2000) provide
additional anatomical details.  Calvo (1999) described a tooth
(MUCPv-52) found in
1987 "on the coast of the Lake Ezquiel Ramos Mexia approximately 5 km.
south of El Chocon" as <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span>
"because it is laterally compressed and oval in cross-section", which
is typical of most Mesozoic theropods.  He stated "the crown shows
close resemblance with that of the holotype", but never provided
details.  Calvo (1989) initially described the dentary MUCPv-95
found in 1987 at Cerro Los Candelaros in an abstract.  He noted it

The combination <i>Carcharodontosaurus carolinii</i> was first used by
Figueiredo (1998) (probably due to confusing <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
and <i>Giganotosaurus</i>, as it was said to be discovered in 1995 but
found in Morocco), but was used as an explicit new combination by Paul
(2010).  Paul's <span style="font-style: italic;">Carcharodontosaurus</span>
concept would encompass all of Carcharodontosaurinae as used here and
has not been followed.<br>
Initially Coria and Salgado (1994) only suggested "affinities with
primitive tetanurines like <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>",
while in its 1995 description they placed it closer to Avetheropoda
than Megalosauroidea without evidence of a quantified analysis, and
without justification for excluding it from Carnosauria.  This was
apparently based on a 6 OTU 36 character quantified analysis (Coria,
1998), although the character list and data matrix were never
published.  Sereno et al. (1996) were the first to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Giganotosaurus</span> in
Carcharodontosauridae, where it has remained in virtually all later
studies.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Brusatte and Sereno's (2008) definition differs from
Holtz et al.'s (2004) by including <i>Passer</i> as an external
specifier. In this case, I agree it's useful for cases like Paul
(2002), Longrich (2001) and Coria and Salgado (1995). I wonder if <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
might be a useful external specifier as well, as tyrannosaurids and
allosaurids have often been posited as sister groups (Paul, 1988;
Kurzanov, 1989; Molnar et al., 1990). However, in all these cases, <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
was seen as an intermediate between <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>,
which would keep tyrannosaurids from being allosaurids under Brusatte
and Sereno's and Holtz et al.'s definitions.</p>

<b>Comments</b>- <i>Allosaurus ferox</i> (Marsh, 1896) is from the
Tithonian Brushy Basin Member (Quarry 14) of the Morrison Formation in
Wyoming. It is based on YPM 1893 (partial skull, partial dentaries,
partial surangular, dorsal central fragment, dorsal rib fragments,
scapular fragment, incomplete pedal ungual), which was found in 1882.
Named in a footnote on page 163 stating "The skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus ferox</span> Marsh has an
aperture in the maxillary in front of the antorbital opening. This
aperture is not present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>",
a maxillary fenestra is now known to be present in all <i>Allosaurus</i>
specimens. Still, the few requirements necessary for publication prior
to 1930 means it's a valid name according to the ICZN. Hay (1908)
believed "The context appears to indicate that "<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus ferox</span>" is a slip of the
pen for <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span>",
which may be true considering Marsh used the nonsensical combination <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus fragilis</span> in the same
publication (<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> has
priority over <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus</span>, so
its type species could never be transferred to the latter genus). It's
been largely ignored thanks to its obscure origin and homonymy with <i>Labrosaurus
ferox</i> (USNM 2315 from Colorado), though generally has been
considered a junior synonym of <i>fragilis</i> (e.g. Molnar et al.,
1990). Glut (1997) published two photos of the specimen, and Chure
(2000) has been the only author to describe it. He states the few odd
features (e.g. convex ventral maxillary margin) are caused by incorrect
restoration, though the antorbital fossa is better developed than most
specimens. Chure refers <i>ferox</i> to <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> as
it supposedly has a highly angled ventral jugal margin unlike his <i style="font-style: italic;">A</i><span style="font-style: italic;">.
jimmadseni</span>, but his plate 102 shows this as restored and the
angle actually varies within specimens referred to each species (see <span style="font-style: italic;">A. jimmadseni</span> entry). As no
elements which differ between <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Saurophaganax</i>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered on July 26 or 27, 1869
(Burger, 2023) and described by Leidy (1870) as a new species of <i>Poekilopleuron</i>
(misspelled <i>Poicilopleuron</i>), but stated if the trabeculae
crossing the internal cavity is shown to be of generic significance,
"it might be named <i>Antrodemus</i>." This single distinguishing
feature is probably positional, as <i>Poekilopleuron</i> only
preserves more distal caudals, and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> shows
trabeculae in proximal caudals but a single central cavity in distal
caudals. It was figured as <i>Antrodemus</i> when in Leidy's (1873)
followup paper. Nopcsa (1901) transferred it to <i>Megalosaurus</i>
without comment. Gilmore (1920) viewed it as synonymous with <i>Allosaurus</i>
based on a section of caudal six from USNM 8367, and it is indeed
basically identical. However, he does not also show they can be
distinguished from other genera. Matthew and Brown (1922) were the
first to note <i>Allosaurus</i> has the advantage of having a
'topotype' (USNM 4734) from the same locality, while the locality of <i>Antrodemus</i>
is inexact. Future authors varied in their choice of <i>Antrodemus</i>
vs. <i>Allosaurus</i>, Huene (1932) using the impossible combination <i>Allosaurus
valens</i> (impossible as <i>Antrodemus</i> has priority). Madsen
(1976) viewed <i>Antrodemus</i> as "questionably" generically
diagnostic and not specfically diagnostic, though he distinguishes it
from <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (narrow ventral edge, smaller median groove,
no paired camerae), he does not note any other taxa besides <i>Allosaurus</i>
that have similar caudals, and does not recognize other species of <i>Allosaurus</i>
besides <i>A. fragilis</i>. Thus neither Gilmore nor Madsen fully
supported their ideas of validity. Chure (2000) distinguishes <i>Antrodemus</i>
from <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i>Torvosaurus</i> (no pleurocoels),
states caudals of <i>Saurophaganax</i> "have been too badly damaged
during preparation for comparison", and notes definitely referred
caudals of <i>Marshosaurus</i> and <i>Stokesosaurus</i> are unknown.
He believes the frequency of <i>Allosaurus</i> finds and similarity
with <i>Antrodemus</i> suggests these are synonymous genera, but
believes it can not be distinguished from <i>A. fragilis</i> or his
new <i>A</i>. "jimmadseni". Thus <i>Antrodemus</i> may turn out to be
generically diagnostic but is not specifically diagnostic in his view. <br>
Comparing <i>Antrodemus</i> to <i>Saurophaganax</i> confirms the
caudals don't definitely differ, with the apparently taller centrum and
missing lateral fossae of the latter being potentially positional
variation or due to poor preparation. <i>Marshosaurus</i>-relative <i>Condorraptor</i>
and <i>Stokesosaurus</i>-relative <i>Juratyrant</i> show no obvious
differences, with the minor differences (no ventral groove in <i>Condorraptor</i>'s
proximal caudal, no obvious chevron facet in <i>Juratyrant</i>'s
complete proximal caudal centrum) easily being positional variation.
Carcharodontosaurids differ in lacking ventral median grooves, though <i>Antrodemus</i>
cannot be distinguished from metriacanthosaurids using published
information. In conclusion it seems <i>Antrodemus</i> cannot be
classified more exactly than Averostra, though it can be distinguished
from many particular taxa. It's probable that if more taxa were
sectioned or CT scanned to determine their cross sectional shape and
internal structure, more could be determined. The near exact structural
match, provenence and large number of <i>Allosaurus</i> finds do
suggest <i>Antrodemus</i> is the same taxon, though this cannot yet be
satisfactorily demonstrated. As the exact stratigraphy is unknown, it's
not even known if this would be referrable to the Brushy Basin species
or the Salt Wash one if Loewen's taxonomic ideas prove correct. As the
diagnostic USNM 4734 is likely to be designated the neotype of <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i> shortly, <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> will have no
meaningful competition to be the valid name for the Morrison allosaurid.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The type of <i>Creosaurus atrox</i> was discovered in
1878. Note this discussion only concerns the holotype, and not the
long-snouted morphology called <i>Allosaurus atrox</i> or <i>Creosaurus</i>
by e.g. Bakker and Paul (discussed under "Short-snouted <i>fragilis</i>
vs. long-snouted <i>atrox</i>?" in the <i>Allosaurus</i> comments).
Marsh originally diagnosed this taxon based on trihedral (premaxillary)
teeth with serrations, amphicoelous (posterior) centra, elongate distal
caudals, elongate metapodials (lost) and sharp unguals, all now known
to be standard for carnosaurs. Marsh reported at least one 277 mm long
metatarsal, though it has not been commented on since and may be lost
prior to 1916 or misidentified. Note that the supposed posterior dorsal
vertebra (actually a proximal caudal) identified by Marsh (1884) as <i>Creosaurus</i>
is actually YPM 1932. Chure (2000) notes the hyoid and manual ungual
listed by Lull (1916 pers. comm. to Gilmore, 1920) are part of the <i>Labrosaurus
lucaris</i> type, while the supposed sternal cannot be reconciled with
existing specimens. As early as Williston (1878), workers supposed <i>Creosaurus</i>
might be synonymous with <i>Allosaurus</i>, with supposed pectoral and
forelimb differences mentioned by Williston (1901) and Hay (1908) being
due to Marsh's '<i>Allosaurus</i>' forelimb being a composite with <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
and <i>Megalosaurus</i> elements. Osborn (1903) described skulls AMNH
600 and 666 as <i>Creosaurus</i>, which probably gave birth to the
concept of long-snouted <i>Creosaurus</i> adopted by Bakker and Paul
decades later. There was no justification for referring either skull to
<i>Creosaurus</i>, and Osborn referred both to <i>Allosaurus</i> a few
years later (Osborn, 1906) and from then on. Gilmore (1920) agreed <i>Creosaurus</i>
was a junior synonym of <i>Allosaurus</i> due to a lack of published
differences, though he declined to discuss specific synonymization
pending further study. Paul and Carpenter (2010) merely stated it was a
nomen dubium without evidence. There had been no examination of the <i>Creosaurus</i>
holotype after this until Chure's thesis, where it is redescribed and
partially illustrated. Note an anterior dorsal neural spine fragment is
listed as part of the type, but not described. Chure referred YPM 1890
to <i>Allosaurus</i> sp., stating it "does not show any feature to
differentiate it from <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> or <i>A. jimmadseni</i>",
despite the fact the jugal shows the ventral deflection he believes
characterizes <i>A. fragilis</i> and the ilium has a vertical ridge
that he states "is not present on any <i>A. fragilis</i> specimen" but
is on the <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>
holotype. Chure also notes that the second and third sacrals of <i>atrox</i>
are V-shaped ventrally in section, unlike those of other <i>Allosaurus</i>
specimens. The fourth and fifth sacrals of <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>'s type have this type of
venter, but the fourth sacral centra of all <i>Allosaurus </i>specimens
have a large lateral foramen, unlike these sacrals. So the sacrum is
different from other <i>Allosaurus</i> specimens, no matter which
vertebrae are represented. YPM 1890 thus seems to be an intermediate
specimen that helps decrease the difference between <i>fragilis</i>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>. Finally,
Chure states pedal ungual III differs from <i>A. fragilis</i> in
having a proximally directed traingular tuber on the proximodorsal
surface, though this seems to be easily explainable by individual
variation. In relation to the larger but coeval <i>Saurophaganax</i>, <i>Creosaurus</i>
doesn't preserve any elements which are said to differ between it and <i>Allosaurus</i>.
It is thus Allosauridae indet., especially as the incomplete sacral and
proximal/mid caudal fusion could indicate immaturity.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- <i>Epanterias amplexus</i> (Cope, 1878) is from the
Tithonian Brushy Basin Member (Cope's Nipple) of the Morrison Formation
in Colorado. The holotype is AMNH 5767 (an axis, mid cervical centrum,
first dorsal neural arch, coracoid and distal metatarsal IV) and was
found in 1877. Only the centrum and neural arch are referenced by Cope,
who believed the taxon to be a camarasaurid. The cited vertebral
characters are typical of <i>Allosaurus</i>- strongly opisthocoelous
cervical with prominent anteriorly placed parapophyses; unelevated,
low, wide and anteroposteriorly short dorsal neural arch; no hyposphene
before mid dorsals; transversely elongate anterior dorsal neural spine
which has three apices; thin anterior dorsal infradiapophyseal laminae;
three infradiapophyseal fossae of which the infraprezygapophyseal fossa
is vertical; deep postspinal fossa; postzygapophyses which overhang the
centrum. However, the claim the anterior dorsal centrum lacks
pleurocoels is untrue (Chure, 2000). Osborn and Mook (1921) were the
first to recognize that <i>Epanterias</i> was a theropod which "at
present cannot be separated from <i>Allosaurus</i>" and illustrate
some of the remains. They also provisionally referred ribs initially
allocated to <i>Camarasaurus</i> and a femur originally referred to <i>Laelaps
trihedrodon</i> by Cope, though Chure says these cannot be located in
the AMNH collections. Their identity remains uncertain. Paul (1988)
referred <i>amplexus</i> questionably to <i>Allosaurus</i> and
thought <i>Saurophaganax</i> was a junior synonym, based on their
shared large size and high stratigraphical position, though he did not
cite morphological characters supporting this. Bakker (1990) followed
this theory and separated <i>Epanterias</i> as a different genus,
referring two caudal vertebrae to it. This was presumably based on size
and stratigraphy, but as no caudals are preserved in the type they
cannot be compared. Contradicting Paul's and Bakker's hypothesis,
modern stratigraphical work has placed the average-sized <i>Allosaurus
ferox</i> type between <i>Saurophaganax</i> and <i>Epanterias</i>,
and the more recently discovered average-sized UMNH VP 5918-5926 is
between them as well. Not only that, the recently discovered large
allosaur NMMNH P-26083 is stratigraphically very close to the
Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry which is full of average-sized specimens. While
Paul is correct that large allosaurs are too rare to be adults of
average-sized allosaurs, <i>Epanterias</i> and NMMNH P-26083 could
simply be large individuals or representatives of larger-sized
populations. Neither were discovered with average-sized allosaurs in
the same quarry, and Bybee et al. (2006) state "Individuals of <i>Allosaurus</i>
did not all grow alike" and could not "directly test whether <i>Allosaurus</i>
had indeterminate growth." Paul and Carpenter (2010) oddly stated <i>Epanterias</i>
"is probably a different taxon from YPM 1930" though also "a nomen
dubium because holotype AMNH 5767 ... is insufficiently diagnostic.",
with neither assertion backed up with evidence. Chure has been the only
author to describe <i>Epanterias</i> in detail and compare it to <i>Saurophaganax</i>
and <i>Allosaurus</i>. Compared to the former<i>,</i> it has
supposedly differently oriented cervical parapophyses and no dorsal
paraspinal lamina. However, I see no difference in parapophyseal
orientation (both ~40 degrees anterodorsally) and Chure admits that the
<i>Epanterias</i> vertebra is more anterior than known <i>Saurophaganax</i>
dorsals with paraspinal laminae, so it may not have developed until
more posterior dorsals. Differences with <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>
that Chure notes are a less laterally compressed axial centrum, less
rectangular distal outline of metatarsal IV and better developed
lateral condyle in that element. Yet the axial centrum seems equally
compressed in USNM 4734, and the metatarsal differences were made with
comparison to Madsen's composite illustrations. Differences with <i>Allosaurus</i>
were considered minor by Chure in any case, and he synonymized <i>Epanterias</i>
with <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>. I agree they are minor if they exist,
but also believe it cannot be distinguished from <i>Saurophaganax</i>
as noted above. Thus <i>Epanterias amplexus</i> becomes Allosauridae
indet. until further distinguishing characters are found.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- <i>Labrosaurus lucaris</i> is from the Tithonian
Brushy Basin Member (Reed's Quarry 3) of the Morrison Formation in
Wyoming. The holotype YPM 1931 was discovered in 1878. It consists of a
partial mandible, hyoid, partial posterior cervical, dorsal and caudal
vertebrae, many vertebral fragments, a humerus and partial forelimb. <i>Allosaurus
lucaris</i> was originally described and diagnosed based solely on an
anterior dorsal vertebra, which was diagnosed by its opisthocoelous
centrum with pleurocoels, ventral keel and anteriorly placed
parapophyses that are the usual characters of carnosaurs. Marsh (1879)
later made <i>lucaris</i> the type of his new genus <i>Labrosaurus</i>,
in his new family Allosauridae. He diagnosed it by short and strongly
opisthocoelous cervicals, moderately opisthocoelous (anterior) dorsals,
both with pleurocoels connected to large internal cavities, tall and
transversely expanded neural spines (in posterior cervicals and
anterior dorsals), anterior presacrals without hyposphenes, small
forelimbs, curved humerus, and large deltopectoral ("radial") crest,
all now known in <i>Allosaurus</i>. Gilmore (1920) illustrated the
humerus in his plate 6 as <i>Antrodemus valens</i>, though otherwise
it has only been illustrated by Chure (2000). Synonymized with '<i>Antrodemus
valens</i>' (<i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>) in Steel's (1970) review, it
has been assumed to be a junior synonym since. Chure also claims it
shows no unique characters and refers it to <i>A. fragilis</i>, though
he does not distinguish it from <i>A</i>. <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span> or even <i>Saurophaganax</i>.
Paul and Carpenter (2010) oddly state it "probably represents a
different species from YPM 1930 [the <i>Allosaurus</i> holotype], and
may or may not belong to the same genus. It is not sufficiently
complete to characterise a species." without defending any of these
assertions. Review of the published information indicates pleurocoels
are reported in the fifth dorsal ("pectoral 5" of Chure) as in <i>Saurophaganax</i>,
yet the proximal outline of manual phalanx II-2 resembles <i>Allosaurus</i>
more in being rectangular instead of oval. Either of these could easily
be explained by individual variation, and <i>Labrosaurus</i> is here
assigned to Allosauridae indet. pending further study.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Chure, 1995) no atlantal prezygapophyses (in
OMNH 1135); no medial projection from atlantal arch to roof over neural
canal (in OMNH 1135); horizontal lamina along base of each side of mid
dorsal neural spines arising from spine base anteriorly, free
posteriorly (in OMNH 1123); ventral part of chevrons greatly expanded
anteriorly (in up to six specimens); femur bowed laterally (in up to
three specimens).<br>
(after Chure, 2000) postorbital lacks rugosity (in OMNH 1771); square
atlantal intercentrum (in OMNH 1135); mid cervicals with nearly
vertical postzygapophyses; mid dorsals have well developed
infraprezygapophyseal lamina (in OMNH 2146); mid dorsals with
vertically oriented infrapostzygapophyseal lamina (in OMNH 1123);
pleurocoels present through fifth dorsal centrum (in OMNH 1123);
radius with marked elliptical muscle attachment near proximoventral
margin of lateral surface (in up to two specimens); spiral muscle scar
on lateral surface of radius shaft (in up to two specimens); proximal
end of manual phalanx II-2 oval instead of rectangular (in OMNH 1921);
weaker astragalar buttress on anterodistal tibia (in both OMNH 1370 and
2149); medial malleolus projects twice as far medially than <i>Allosaurus</i>
(in up to two specimens); distal end of metatarsal IV rectangular
instead of triangular (in up to three specimens).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Chure (2000) stated that the cnemial crest is
deflected laterally more than in <i>Allosaurus</i>, the lateral
surface of the lateral tibial condyle is concave (instead of convex),
the lateral tibial condyle is more posteriorly placed than in <i>Allosaurus</i>,
the fibular crest is more set off from shaft, and the medioventral
corner of pedal phalanx III-1's proximal edge being angled inward were
all unlike <i>Allosaurus</i>, but that genus shows these conditions
too (UUVP coll. from Madsen, 1976). Metatarsal IV is indeed less
distally divergent than some <i>A. fragilis</i> (e.g. AMNH 324, DINO
11541), but not other <i>fragilis</i> specimens (e.g. MOR 693). <br>
<b>Comments</b>- At least four individuals are represented by the OMNH
material. Chure (1995) originally mentioned anterior cervicals, caudal
centra and a tridactyl manus, which would be paratype material if their
specimen numbers could be determined. Though generally accepted as a
species distinct from <i>A. fragilis</i>, <i>Saurophaganax</i> is
represented by multiple individuals with uncertain referral of
particular elements to each one, and reportedly distinctive characters
are not stated to be present in multiple specimens except for distal
chevron expansion and astragalar buttress strength. Indeed, nine of the
characters can only be evaluated for one specimen. Thus the apparent
distinctiveness of this taxon may be due to individuals each having a
few unique characters, as is true of most well described Morrison
allosaurs. Resolution will involve more detailed information on each
specimen and more description of the variation in Morrison allosaurids.
Smith (2008) found no morphometric differences between <i>maximus</i>
and <i>fragilis</i> in at least the humerus and femur. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Chure, 2000) fenestrate dorsal wall of
maxillary antrum (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>); spindle-shaped
foramen on lateral surface of sacral centrum 4 (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>);
obturator process with long anteriorly directed lamina that extends to
level of puboischiadic contact (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>).<br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) tall, transversely compressed lacrimal
horn (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>); reduced external mandibular
fenestra (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>); strongly downturned
paraoccipital processes that terminate well ventral to basal tubera
(unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>); antarticular bone in mandible
(unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>); distal expansion of ischium suboval
in lateral view (unknown in <i>Saurophaganax</i>).<br>
<b>Not <i>Allosaurus</i></b>- The AMNH online catalog lists AMNH 3838
as <i>Allosaurus</i>? sp. based on several teeth from the Belly River
Group of Alberta, Canada, but these are near certainly tyrannosaurid
based on locaility. Similarly, the UCMP online catalog lists UCMP
136555 and 136556 as <i>Allosaurus</i> based on two teeth from the
Judith River Group of Montana, which are also presumably tyrannosaurid.

<b>Comments</b>- Note that most of the above material has not been
described, and much is probably not distinguishable from <i>Saurophaganax</i>
based on what little we know of the latter genus. Indeed, as <i>Allosaurus</i>
is the most common Morrison theropod, it is likely material is often
ascribed to it without good reason, so some specimens may belong to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>,
<i>Marshosaurus</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i>, <i>Stokesosaurus</i>, etc..
There is abundant material from numerous quarries, not all of which are
guaranteed to be listed above, though all states and members are
covered. For details on these, see Turner and Patterson (1999) and
Foster (2003).<br>
<b>The types</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1877, and is from the
Tithonian Brushy Basin Member (Felch Quarry 1) of the Morrison
Formation in Colorado. It consists merely of an incomplete tooth,
incomplete cervical or anterior dorsal centrum, two post-cervical
centra (posterior dorsal and proximal caudal in Marsh 1877; posterior
dorsal and posterior sacral in Gilmore, 1920; dorsal and posterior
dorsal in Chure, 2000; caudals in Loewen and Chure, 2010), two rib
fragments, a humeral fragment and pedal phalanx III-1. Marsh diagnosed
this by amphicoelous (postcervical) centra transversely and ventrally
reduced in size in the middle and slender "feet bones" (pedal phalanx
III-1). These characters are plesiomorphic for theropods. Although
partially figured by Gilmore, Madsen (1976) and Glut (1997), the
material has only been described by Chure. Prior authors have viewed
the holotype in different ways- Gilmore felt it was "hardly more
diagnostic" than <i>Antrodemus</i>, Madsen thought the humerus was
specifically diagnostic, and Chure admitted it could not be
distinguished from <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>
but depended on his topotype. The tooth, unprepared presacral centrum,
rib fragments and pedal phalanx cannot be identified past at least
Carnosauria based on published information. One incomplete dorsal
centrum resembles the fourth dorsal (fifth in Madsen, 1976) most based
on the centrum elongation and shallow ventral concavity, though its
broad ventral surface is first found on dorsal six of DINO 11541. It
can be distinguished from carcharodontosaurids based on the lack of
pleurocoels and from metriacanthosaurids based on its greater width. If
this is a fourth dorsal, its lack of pleurocoels would also distinguish
it from <i>Saurophaganax</i>, which seems to have them extend through
dorsal five. The longer centrum seems to be a fifth sacral based on its
width (minimum width 79% of length), in agreement with Gilmore's
identification as a posterior sacral but contrasting with Chure's
identification as a posterior dorsal. It is broader than
metriacanthosaurids and <i>Neovenator</i>, and lacks pleurocoels
present in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>. Chure states <i>Allosaurus</i>
has shallow central fossae in its sacrals (visible in USNM 4734-
Gilmore, 1920) while <i>Saurophaganax</i> lacks them in sacral five,
and these are present in the <i>Allosaurus</i> holotype. Note that
while Loewen and Chure (2010) have most recently identified both of
these centra as caudals without comment, <i>Allosaurus</i> has a
narrow ventral margin on its caudal vertebrae whereas these are broad.
Madsen concentrated on the humeral fragment to support the holotype's
diagnostic nature, referencing the position of the m. humeroralialis
scar and nutrient foramen. Unfortunately, carnosaur humeri are seldomly
preserved and often not illustrated or described in detail. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
and <i>Mapusaurus</i> both have a more posteriorly placed scar and the
former at least has a more anteriorly placed foramen. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
also has a more abruptly expanded deltopectoral crest. However, <i>Saurophaganax</i>
has an anteriorly placed scar as in the holotype, though the position
of its foramen cannot be determined from publications. This suggests
the humerus is at best identifiable to Allosauridae based on published
information, and not a particular genus. This review suggests that the
holotype might be referred to <i>Allosaurus</i> based on the lack of
pleurocoels in dorsal ~4 and the the lateral fossae in sacral 5, but
these are based on estimated positions in the holotype's and <i>Saurophaganax</i>'s
material. <br>
Madsen (1976) tried to designate DINO 2560 (then UUVP 6000) as a
neotype, but this is generally not allowed when the holotype is still
extant (ICZN Article 75.3.4). The nearly complete specimen USNM 4734
was designated the topotype by Chure (2000) as it comes from the same
quarry as the holotype, but the ICZN does not recognize topotypes as
official and the publication is a thesis. Most recently, Paul and
Carpenter (2010) have petitioned the ICZN to make USNM 4734 the neotype
of <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>. There are a number of issues with the
petition however. Paul and Carpenter fail to list a centrum, humeral
fragment and the rib fragments (noted by Demirjian, 2010 and Loewen and
Chure, 2010) and continue to identify both free centra as dorsals,
which is seemingly incorrect for at least one as noted above. They
simply state the holotype elements "are inadequate to diagnose a genus,
much less a species, YPM 1930 can only be identified to family level"
without any detailed examination or reference to such an examination.
As detailed above, the holotype may share characters with <i>Allosaurus</i>
to the exclusion of <i>Saurophaganax</i> (the only other commonly
accepted allosaurid genus), a genus the authors never mention. Paul and
Carpenter declare numerous species to be indeterminate without
providing evidence, some of which are also said to be probably distinct
from the holotype's species, also without evidence. Regardless of these
deficiencies and the lack of any detailed published comparative study
of the holotype, USNM 4734 was declared the neotype by the ICZN on
December 29 2023 (ICZN, 2023).<br>
The neotype was discovered in 1883 from the locality of the holotype.
This was first reported and illustrated by Marsh in 1884 (Gilmore,
1920), contrary to Chure (2000) stating parts were illustrated by Marsh
in 1879, prior to its actual discovery (the pubis illustrated by Marsh
1879 is the YPM specimen shown in Gilmore's plate 11, while the
ischium's identity remains uncertain). Only the pelvis and hindlimb are
from USNM 4734 however, the humerus being YPM 1894, and the rest based
on <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i>Megalosaurus</i>. Gilmore (1915)
described the actual pectoral girdle and forelimb of USNM 4734 and
later (1920) described much of the rest of the specimen, though note
most of the axial description is of USNM 8367. Chure notes the right
dentary on the specimen is actually from USNM 8335 while Loewen and
Chure (2010) state the premaxilla is too large and thus from another
individual. The latter authors also provide a materials list for USNM
4734, though because Gilmore says not all carpals were found for each
side and leaves some measurements unknown for the left manus, their
description of the forelimbs as complete may be incorrect. USNM 4734
can be assigned to <i>Allosaurus</i> instead of <i>Saurophaganax</i>
based on having atlantal prezygapophyses, a semilunate atlantal
intercentrum, dorsal pleurocoels limited to the first two centra,
posterior dorsals lacking a paraspinal lamina, and the tibia having an
astragalar buttress and a poorly projected medial malleolus. <br>
Marsh (1896) wrote "Pelvis of <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus
fragilis</span> Marsh, seen from the
left" for Plate XIII Figure 5 which is the pubis and ischium
illustrated by him in 1879 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus
fragilis</span>.  Nopcsa (1901) listed both the megalosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span> and the
labrosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus fragilis</span>,
apparently believing them to be separate valid species.  Hay
(1908) incorrectly stated "<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus
ferox</span> seems to be called <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus
fragilis</span> on page 270" because the pelvic elements had never been
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">ferox</span> before, and
instead Chure (2000) is probably correct in saying "It would appear
that <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus fragilis</span> is
a lapsus calami for <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus
fragilis</span>."  While typos are not generally cataloged here, <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus fragilis</span> is given an
entry since Nopcsa viewed it as a valid species.  Similarly, since
Marsh and Nopsca both listed <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus
fragilis</span> separately, it's not considered a recombination of that
species (which would be impossible anyway as <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> has priority over <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus</span>).<br>
<b>Short-snouted <i>fragilis</i> vs. long-snouted <i>atrox</i>?</b>-
In the 1980s and 1990s it was common (e.g. Paul, 1988; Britt, 1991) to
recognize two types of normal-sized Morrison <i>Allosaurus</i>- one
with a shorter snout and pointed lacrimal horns (usually called <i>A.
fragilis</i>) and another with a long snout and rounded lacrimal horns
(usually called <i>A. atrox</i>, and sometimes separated as <i>Creosaurus</i>).
While <i>A. fragilis</i> sensu stricto has been based mainly on the <i>A.
fragilis</i> neotype, the '<i>A. atrox</i>' morphology has not been
based on the <i>Creosaurus atrox</i> holotype but instead probably
originates in Osborn (1903) describing the elongate skulls AMNH 600 and
666 as <i>Creosaurus</i>. Thus, actual discussion of the <i>Creosaurus</i>
holotype is separated in its own entry here, while the long-snouted
morphotype will be called '<i>A. atrox</i>' for this section. Regarding
the supposedly shorter skull of <i>A. fragilis</i>, Smith (1998) first
noted the neotype "does not have any significant differences from the
articulated crania from the other sites at the individual element level
... Given the results presented here, a case could be made that this
specimen might be more correctly reconstructed as having a longer
snout." Such a case was made by Chure (2000), who notes that is the
only short skull known, and it was found disarticulated. When it was
reconstructed by Gilmore (1920), he had to "comprimise in regard to the
exact articulation of the elements". There are large plaster filled
gaps in the specimen, the contact between the maxilla, jugal and
lacrimal is missing, the dentary is from another specimen, the other
mandible is plaster, the palate is fragmentary, and the postorbital
regions are distorted judging by their asymmetry. Chure notes the
maxilla is reconstructed too far posteriorly, as the lacrimal
articulation of the dorsal process is projecting into the antorbital
fenestra. The angle between the maxillary body and its dorsal process
is similar to other <i>Allosaurus</i> specimens, which wouldn't make
sense if the snout were shorter. Similarily, the angle between the
anterior and ventral lacrimal processes is in the middle of the range <i>Allosaurus
</i>exhibits, with Cleveland-Lloyd '<i>A.atrox</i>' specimens showing
marked variation. The nasal of the neotype is broken and the anterior
part moved dorsally and rotated ventrally. The lacrimal horn shape
shows many intermediates between tall and triangular (USNM 4734) and
low and rounded (DINO 2650), and there is an example of a triangular
lacrimal on a long skull (MOR 693). Contra Paul, triangular lacrimals
are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd quarry (eg. UUVP 40-581). Though
Paul claimed '<i>A. atrox</i>' has a more robust neck, there is no
difference when cervical width/length ratios are compared. Similarily,
though Paul claimed '<i>A. atrox</i>' has a more robust forelimb, no
difference was noted when humeral circumference and length were
quantitatively compared (circumference/length ratio .45 in <i>A.
fragilis</i>, .36-.49 in '<i>A. atrox</i>'). Finally, both supposed
species are found in the same quarry, as evidenced by AMNH 600
(referred to <i>A. fragilis</i> by Paul) and AMNH 666 (which he
referred to '<i>A. atrox</i>'). This is contrary to the stratigraphic
distinction supported by Bakker and others. In conclusion, there is no
evidence for the <i>fragilis</i>/<i>atrox</i> dichotomy advocated by
Paul and Bakker, though it continues to be used in taxonomic arguments
(e.g. Paul and Carpenter, 2010).<br>
<b><i>Camptonotus amplus</i></b>- <i>Camptonotus amplus</i> (Marsh,
1879) was described based on an incomplete pes found in 1879. The
diagnosis compared to the type species <i>C. dispar</i> described in
the same paper was a combination of characters found in both species
(reduced pedal digit I; fifth pedal digit absent), those typical of <i>Allosaurus</i>
(larger than <i>Camptosaurus</i>; metatarsal I not contacting tarsus),
one innaccurate character (pedal ungual II proportionately longer-
actually 34% of mtII length in <i>amplus</i> vs. 44% in <i>dispar</i>),
one based on an incorrectly assigned element (pedal ungual I more
compressed transversely), and two that are too vague to evaluate (first
metatarsal "much curved"; pedal digits III and IV "large and
powerful"). Marsh (1885) later renamed the genus <i>Camptosaurus</i>,
as <i>Camptonotus</i> was preoccupied by gryllacridid cricket named by
Uhler in 1864. Gilmore (1909) briefly commented on <i>C. amplus</i> in
his <i>Camptosaurus</i> monograph and provisionally referred the skull
YPM 1887 to it because of its large size (later named <i>Theiophytalia
kerri</i> in 2007). Based on a personal communication with Bakker,
Galton and Powell (1980) referred <i>amplus</i> to <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i>. This has been reconfirmed by McDonald (2011), and the
specimen finally received a modern description in Galton et al. (2015).
These authors confirmed the material belongs to Allosauroidea, except
for the pedal ungual I which they identify as sauropod and probably <i>Camarasaurus</i>,
recataloging it as YPM 58526. Additionally, they note <i>Allosaurus</i>
specimen YPM 1892 was found in the same quarry and is of comparable
size, so probably belongs to the same individual. Galton et al.
provisionally create the new combination <i>Allosaurus? amplus</i>,
stating it differs from <i>A. fragilis</i> and <i>Saurophaganax</i>
in having a longer non-tapered portion of metatarsal I, and differs
from <i>A. fragilis</i> but not <i>Saurophaganax</i> in having a
broad distal metatarsal IV articular surface. They also posit the
rather complete yet mostly undescribed specimen AMNH 5753 may be
referrable to <i>A? amplus</i> as it shares the broad distal
metatarsal IV. <br>
The condition of metatarsal I is different from Madsen's composite UUVP
figure, DINO 11541 and 22 UMNH specimens mentioned by Galton et al.,
but basically every well described <i>Allosaurus</i> specimen differs
from others in some characters. Similarly, narrow distal metatarsal IVs
are reported in Madsen's composite and DINO 11541, while wide ones are
present in AMNH 5753, USNM 57589, YPM 1879 and <i>Saurophaganax</i>
specimen OMNH 1936. There is thus no established pattern that width
relates to taxonomy, as no two specimens referred to the same species
based on other characters have been shown to have the same condition.
There are also examples from each member of the Morrison with each
morphology, so the distinction is not stratigraphic and is here viewed
as individual variation. However, the distal end of metatarsal IV is
triangular in <i>amplus</i> as in <i>Allosaurus</i> (including USNM
57589; AMNH 5753's are unfigured) but not the only figured specimen of <i>Saurophaganax</i>.
Because of this, <i>amplus</i> is here synonymized with <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i> pending defensible subdivision of that species. <br>
Interestingly, <i>amplus</i> is the first officially named allosaurid
from the Salt Wash Member, so if Loewen's (2009a) studies are correct
that each member has its own species, the lower member's species would
be <i>Allosaurus amplus</i> instead of <i>A. jimmadseni</i> (unless <i>amplus</i>
is specifically indeterminate). Thus it seems important to compare to <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>'s pes. Unfortunately,
the only pedal character identified by Chure (2000a) as differing
between <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span> and <i>fragilis</i>
is "proximal corner of pedal phalanx III-2 projected further
laterally", which doesn't seem to actually be true. There are also no
characters preserved and published in YPM 1892 which can be compared to
Chure's distinctions between <i>A. fragilis</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>. The metatarsi are quite
dissimilar as far as allosaurid specimens go, with <i>amplus</i> far
more robust, having a distolateral slope to the proximal surface vs. a
distomedial one, distally more bowed metatarsals III and IV which
narrow and close the space between them, a less ginglymoid metatarsal
III, proximally broader metatarsal II, posteriorly convex proximal
outline of metatarsal IV, shallower posterior intercondylar groove of
metatarsal II, side edges of metatarsal III's distal outline that are
slanted ventromedially instead of ventrolaterally, a more convex
dorsolateral edge to the distal outline of metatarsal IV, plus the
metatarsal I and distal metatarsal IV distinctions noted by Galton et
al.. Some of these differences may be ontogenetic as <i>amplus</i> is
53% larger than <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>,
but these specimens do nothing to support Salt Wash allosaurids being a
coherent species separate from <i>A. fragilis</i>. <br>
<i><b>Labrosaurus ferox</b>- Labrosaurus ferox</i> (Marsh, 1884) is
based on a pathological dentary (USNM 2315) from the Kimmeridgian
Brushy Basin Member (Felch Quarry 1) of the Morrison Formation in
Colorado, found in 1883. It was initially diagnosed by the toothless
anterior (pathological), ventrally extended posterior edge (also found
in <i>A. fragilis</i>- MOR 693 in Chure, 2000) and triangular teeth
(unpreserved except for replacement tips). Hay (1908) recognized that <i>Labrosaurus
ferox</i> could not be compared to the genus' type species <i>lucaris</i>,
though he viewed the pathological morphology as natural so separated it
from <i>Allosaurus</i>. Gilmore (1920) was the first to suggest
pathology for the concave edentulous section of the dentary. Bakker
(2000) suggested the dentary "fits well into the anterior end of the
post-dentary bones of USNM 4734 and certainly belongs to the same
species if not the same individual", and is from the same quarry. As
such, this could be an objective junior synonym of <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i>, though it it incomparable to <i>Saurophaganax</i>.<br>
<b>"Madsenius"</b>- This name was orginally reported in a childrens
book (Lambert, 1990) as "a proposed new allosaurid theropod to be
formally named and described." Olshevsky (1991) listed it under
Allosauridae as a taxon "to be described from the Morrison Formation by
R. T. Bakker; based on distinctive skull material and other remains
previously referred to <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Creosaurus</i>."
Olshevsky (2004 online) wrote "trux" "was to have been Bakker's
original type species epithet for the as-yet-unpublished genus
Madsenius. According to him, it fits Madsen as appropriately as it fits
Madsenius" [etymology- Latin trux means "fierce, rough, savage, wild"].
Williams (2004 online) replied "This is essentially the version I heard
too ~ "trux" = truculent."<br>
While nothing else unique has been written regarding "Madsenius", I
believe clues in the literature point to its probable identity. Since
at least 1988, Bakker has proposed two kinds of Morrison allosaur, the
classic short-snouted <i>fragilis</i> vs. long-snouted '<i>atrox</i>'
dichotomy. Bakker (2000) cited the latter species as "The creosaur-type
allosaurid (unfortunately, the type of <i>Creosaurus</i> MARSH is, by
itself, indeterminate): Dinosaur National Monument skeleton University
of Utah UUVP 6000 ..." as opposed to "True <i>Allosaurus</i> MARSH:
specimens from the type locality of <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> MARSH -
the skeleton United States National Museum USNM 4734 ..." In that
paper, he stated "These two types of skulls are easy to tell apart from
the quadrate, lower temporal fenestra, and depth of the mandible;
however, I find it impossible to separate the two taxa from isolated
snout bones or post-crania." This matches the "distinctive skull
material" noted by Olshevsky, and the 'long-snouted' skulls have been
referred to both <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Creosaurus</i> by different
workers, also matching Olshevsky's comment. Furthermore, UUVP 6000
(later recatalogd as DINO 2560) was the basis of Madsen's (1976)
classic <i>Allosaurus</i> monograph and "Madsenius" clearly refers to
Madsen. Putting everything together, I think it's apparent "Madsenius"
was to be Bakker's name for creosaur-type allosaurs when he realized
the <i>Creosaurus</i> holotype couldn't be assigned to either variety.
UUVP 6000 was probably supposed to be the holotype. <br>
If we accept this explanation, Bakker's characters supporting
"Madsenius" can be evaluated. Bakker states the ventral quadrate angles
posteriorly in DINO 2560, forming a deeply concave posterior edge to
the element unlike <i>A. fragilis</i> AMNH 600. The posterior angle
formed by the dorsal and ventral quadrate edges is 24 degrees in AMNH
600 compared to 30 degrees in the UUVP coll. quadrate illustrated by
Madsen and 27 degrees in his cranial reconstruction of DINO 2560.
Bakker's DINO 2560 illustration shows an unprecedented angle of 52
degrees. Angles in other specimens are 18 (AMNH 30798), ~44 (BYU
571/8901), 30 (DINO 11541), 43 (MOR 693), 15 (SMA 005/02) and 34
degrees (USNM 4734). For the laterotemporal fenestra, Bakker states the
restriction caused by the ventral squamosal process is greater in <i>A.
fragilis</i> AMNH 600 (least anteroposterior length of fenestra 15% of
dorsoventral height) than DINO 2560 (26% in Madsen's reconstruction,
28% in Bakker's). Measurements in other specimens are ~25% (AMNH 666),
31% (AMNH 30798), &lt;24% (BYU 571/8901), 38% (DINO 11541), 20% (ML
415), 40% (MOR 693), 38% (SMA 005/02) and 16% (USNM 4734). Mandibular
depth is 19% of length in Bakker's DINO 2560 (similar to 19% in
Madsen's reconstruction) and 24% in his <i>A. fragilis</i>
illustration, though the latter is a composite between AMNH 666 (which
has only a partial surangular) and 5753 (which does not include
mandibular elements). So even this minor 5% difference cannot be
determined. Values in other specimens are ~19% (AMNH 30798), ~21% (BYU
571/8901), 17% (DINO 11541), 19% (MOR 693) and 20% (SMA 005/02). The
above comparison suggests mandibular depth is fairly constant in known
allosaurids, though quadrate angling and laterotemporal fenestra
proportions vary widely. Yet importantly, the latter conditions both
exhibit intermediates instead of two distinct clusters, and do not
covary- AMNH 30798 and SMA 00/02 have low quadrate angles but wide
laterotemporal fenestrae, while USNM 4734 has a high angle but
restricted fenestra. Note neither of these conditions vary with
stratigraphy either, and indeed the <i>A. fragilis</i> types and DINO
2560 are both from the Brushy Basin Member. Nor does it vary
geographically, with Wyoming specimens encompassing almost the entirity
of the variation. Based on this study then, "Madsenius" can be
considered a synonym of <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> and another example
of Bakker's notorious splitting. <br>
<i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> <b>"whitei"-</b> This is based on a skull
with hyoid, presacral column, sacrum and pelvis (AMNH 666) discovered
in 1901, first mentioned in Osborn (1903) as <i>Creosaurus</i>. These
were recovered from the Kimmeridgian Salt Wash Member (Bone Cabin
Quarry) of the Morrison Formation in Wyoming. It was diagnosed by the
same characters Paul (1988) used to distinguish '<i>A. atrox</i>' (low,
long skull; bluntly rounded lacrimal horn; slender limb elements), so
is invalid for the same reasons. Only the skull has ever been
illustrated (in Osborn, 1906 and 1912) and was only briefly described.
Pickering initially listed the name in a 1995 publication which he
agrees only established a nomen nudum, and later used it in more detail
in a 1996 publication which he sees as valid. Chure (2000a) rejected
the validity of the name, as Pickering didn't follow ICZN Article 8
Recommendation 8A (Authors have a responsibility to ensure that new
scientific names, nomenclatural acts, and information likely to affect
nomenclature are made widely known), Article 8.1.1 (it must be issued
for the purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific record),
Article 8.1.2 (it must be obtainable, when first issued, free of charge
or by purchase), and a recommendation from the third edition of the
ICZN absent in the fourth edition (conventional printing being
preferred, though the new Article 8.4.1 expressly allows Pickering's
method). As recommendations are optional, only Articles 8.1.1 and 8.1.2
are necessary for the name to be valid. Article 8.1.1 is about intent,
and while Chure is correct that Pickering's 1996 work is far from a
traditional scientific work, his online remarks indicate new names
there were meant to be public, permanent and scientifically valid.
Regarding Article 8.1.2, Chure states it was sent to "some unknown
number of personal friends of the author", but Pickering (online, 2002)
stated "well over 150 copies of my publication were distributed as a
supplement to Mike Fredericks' PREHISTORIC TIMES in 1996". The former
would not qualify under 8.1.2, though the latter would. As for AMNH
666, the meager published information is insufficient to assign it to <i>Allosaurus</i>
or <i>Saurophaganax</i>, though several characters of the latter genus
(postorbital lacks rugosity; mid cervicals with nearly vertical
postzygapophyses; mid dorsals have well developed infraprezygapophyseal
lamina; mid dorsals with vertically oriented infrapostzygapophyseal
lamina; pleurocoels present through fifth dorsal centrum) could be
checked in the material. Pickering also designated AMNH 5753 as a
topotype, which the ICZN does not recognize but is considered a
specimen from the same locality as the holotype. This is the mounted
specimen standing low over <i>Apatosaurus</i> vertebrae (AMNH 222),
but Chure notes it was from Aurora Quarry 3 so cannot be a topotype.
Pickering (1996) also lists AMNH 275, 290, 324, 496, 600, 680, 704,
726, 728, 736, 737, 851, 5752, 6125, 6128, MCZ 3897 and possibly DINO
2560 as referred specimens. If "whitei" turns out to be a valid name,
and <i>amplus</i> is specifically indeterminate, and Loewen's studies
are correct that Salt Wash specimens aren't <i>A. fragilis</i>,
"whitei" would be the next valid name for that species. However, note
AMNH 704, 726, 728, 736, 737, 5752 and 5753 are from quarries that have
not been placed in the Salt Wash Member with certainty, and that MCZ
3897 and DINO 2560 are from the Brushy Basin Member so would be <i>A.
fragilis</i> on stratigraphic grounds.<br>
<b>"Wyomingraptor"</b>- This name was published in the column 'Dr.
Bob's Dinofacts' in response to a question from a reader (Anonymous,
1997). The author (possibly Bakker himself) suggested it for a Tate
Geological Museum specimen currently labeled <i>Allosaurus</i>. From
1997 until 2006, the Tate Museum included a "Wyomingraptor" section in
its exhibits page, stating Bakker has proposed that name for a new
genus of allosaur found at Como Bluff including a photographed
forelimb. In the PaleoWorld episode "Killer Raptors" (episode 7 of
season 4) aired in 1997, Bakker claims the only theropod preserved in
Nail Quarry is "Wyomingraptor" (though note this is untrue, as the
"Brontoraptor" material was also found there). The material (three
adults and numerous juvenile to adult teeth) was mentioned in Bakker
(1997) where he simply calls them <i>Allosaurus</i>. Hartman (DML,
2000) wrote that Bakker has been "attempting to erect a new genus of
allosaur, which he dubs "Wyomingraptor." He has been using this name
for some time, but recently has found a specimen he thinks is different
enough from the type(s) to warrant generic distinction." Given Bakker's
notoriety as a splitter, the Nail specimens are likely to just be <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i> in any case. The photographed forelimb is similar to <i>A.
fragilis</i> neotype USNM 4734 except for being more robust, at least
in metacarpal I, phalanx II-1 and II-2. Indeed, the robust first
metacarpal is similar <i>Torvosaurus</i>, though the elongate phalanx
I-1, radius and ulna are not. The forelimb is stated to be a cast, so
it's not certain how much is based on real Nail fossils. It's possible
some elements were scaled incorrectly from other specimens or are
complete fabrications. It's also possible some material such as
metacarpal I actually comes from the "Brontoraptor" individuals and
that the forelimb is a chimaera. Further evaluation awaits description
of the Nail material, which has yet to be distinguished from <i>Saurophaganax</i>
either.  Currie and Carpenter (2000) mention "specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> (MOR 693, TATE 11, USNM
4734) that are 20% smaller than <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
have radii, ulnae and metacarpals that are absolutely longer than the
same elements in <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>",
which makes it possible TATE 11 is the "Wyomingraptor" material, as
allosaur forelimbs are uncommon.  Sacral and tibial measurements
were used by Currie and Coria (2016), who also estimated its total
length.<br>
<b><i>A.</i><span style="font-style: italic;"> jimmadseni</span></b>-
DINO 11541 was discovered on July 15 1990 in the Kimmeridgian Salt Wash
Member of the Morrison Formation in Utah (quarry DNM 116). Chure
(2000a) described it in his thesis as a new species, <i>Allosaurus</i>
"jimmadseni", first published by Glut (2003).  Several more recent
sources have used <i>A.</i>
"jimmadseni" as valid (Snively et al., 2004; Malafaia et al., 2007;
Rauhut, 2011; Dalman, 2014a and b). None of these establish the species
as they lack an explicit statement of novelty (ICZN Article 16.1), but
it was officially named by Chure and Loewen (2020) who also described
the skull, mandible, hyoid and axis.  They also refer several
other specimens to <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>-
all BYU Dry Mesa Quarry material "including:
BYU 4861, 5164, 5268, 5292, 5583, 11936, 13621, 16942, 17106, 17281",
MOR 693, SDSM 30510, SMA 0005, UMNH VPC 481 and USNM 544100.  This
seems to be a continuation of work done by Loewen (2004), Brandau et
al. (2008) and Loewen (2009a, b), who performed a "morphometric
analysis of over 570 bivariate comparisons for 1,300 specimens" of
skulls and hindlimbs and found two <i>Allosaurus</i> species,
stratigraphically separated.  Note that a division between members
isn't exactly the same as Chure's hypothesis of <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>, as Chure considered
AMNH 507, 600, 666, 680, 851 and 6125 to be <i>A. fragilis</i>
despite being from the Salt Wash Member, while Chure and Loewen (2020)
referred "all allosaurid material from the Dry Mesa Quarry, CO curated
at BYU" to <span style="font-style: italic;">A. jimmadseni</span>
despite being from the Brushy Basin Member.  Chure and Loewen
explain the latter as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus
jimmadseni</span>
occurs below the "clay change" of Turner &amp; Peterson (1999), except
for at DMQ, which occurs only two m above the "clay change"." 
This
might therefore correspond to the boundary between Dinosaur Zones 2 and
3 of Turner and Peterson, but the Bone Cabin quarry that yielded
supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span>
AMNH 600 and 666 is ~100 meters below the clay change so would create
significant stratigraphic overlap.  Pinegar et al. (2003)
mentioned two NAMAL specimens they referred to <i style="font-style: italic;">A</i><span style="font-style: italic;">.
jimmadseni</span>. Skin impressions found with the juvenile consist of
2-3mm wide scales.  Galiano and Albersdorfer (2010) reported an
additional <i style="font-style: italic;">A</i><span style="font-style: italic;">. jimmadseni</span> specimen from the Dana
Quarry of Wyoming. Nicknamed Dracula, it is reportedly ~70% complete,
missing the tail and some dorsals. The AMNH has acquired it as AMNH
30798. <br>
Chure (2000a) diagnosed <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>
based on- row of maxillary neurovascular foramina below antorbital
fenestra in antorbital fossa (also used in official diagnosis; also in
AMNH 600; only one foramen in MOR 693); axial intercentrum rotated
dorsally (also used in official diagnosis; not in MOR 693); axial
intercentrum with flared rim (also used in official diagnosis; not in
MOR 693); accessory ossifications on the anterior and posterior edges
of proximal caudal neural spines (these are merely the interspinous
ligaments, which are partially ossified in <i>A. fragilis</i> as
well); anteroposteriorly elongate obturator notch in pubis delimited by
triangular processes (a further ossification of cartilaginous areas in
most <i>Allosaurus</i>, with e.g. the distal triangular process
present but more poorly developed in the YPM specimen in plate 11 of
Gilmore 1920; Chure notes AMNH 813 seems to have an enclosed obturator
foramen, which would be another example); proximal corner of pedal
phalanx III-2 projected further laterally (untrue compared to AMNH 324
and Madsen's 1976 UUVP coll.). He also lists numerous supposed
differences from <i>A. fragilis</i>-
premaxillary narial fossa less well defined (difficult to evaluate);
large foramen between lacrimal and jugal (not maxilla, contra Chure's
text) at posteroventral corner of antorbital fossa (placed entirely
within lacrimal by Chure and Loewen 2020; not in MOR 693 or SMA 0005);
elongate medial fenestra to maxillary antrum (not verified in other <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>
specimens); rounded lacrimal horn (distortion?; also in most
Cleveland-Lloyd specimens- Carpenter, 2010); lateral pneumatic recess
of lacrimal absent (untrue); lateral vertical ridge on lacrimal horn
(untrue based on Chure and Loewen 2020); lacrimal horn not rugose
(untrue based on Chure and Loewen 2020); straighter ventral margin of
jugal (also used in official diagnosis and in Loewen 2004 and 2009;
also in AMNH 600; curvature same in SMA 0005, UMNH 8976 and 9084,
within <span style="font-style: italic;">fragilis</span> range in BYU
5122); parietals fused posteriorly (untrue); parietals taller than wide
in posterior view (untrue); basipterygoid recess well marked and
invasive (variable in <i>fragilis</i>- Chure and Madsen, 1996a);
myohyloid foramen nearly enclosed ventrally (variable in <i>fragilis</i>-
Madsen, 1976); teardrop-shaped internal mandibular foramen in
anteroventral prearticular (not verified in other <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span> specimens); nineteen
dentary teeth (18 in BYU 2028 and SMA 0005; 18 and 19 in MOR 693);
odontoid process of axis tall and narrow in anterior view (seemingly
untrue based on plate); third cervical neural spine slanted posteriorly
(also in AMNH 5753 and USNM 8367; not known to be absent in any <i>fragilis</i>
specimen); fourth through sixth neural spines more anteroposteriorly
elongate (untrue of c6 in USNM 8367); cervical pleurocoels change in
size throughout the vertebral column (not known to be absent in any <i>fragilis</i>
specimen); fifth and sixth cervical epipophyses transversely compressed
(true in c4, 5 and 7 in Madsen's 1976 UUVP coll.); presacral eleven
with parapophysis fully on centrum (also in AMNH 5753 and Madsen's 1976
UUVP coll.; in USNM 4734 "the upper edge reaches the neurocentral
suture", so this is not much different); hypapophysis on presacral 11
instead of 12 (also in AMNH 5753; on both in Madsen's 1976 UUVP coll.
and USNM 4734); less pronounced notch between acromion and anterior
coracoid edge (barely apparent if at all compared to USNM 4734); distal
scapula not as expanded dorsally (barely apparent if at all compared to
Madsen's 1976 UUVP coll.); coracoid extremely thin anteriorly (not
verified in other <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>
specimens); more gracile ulna (limb gracility shows variation in <i>A.
fragilis</i>- e.g. humerus in Smith's 1998 study showing diameters
varying from ~40 to ~90 mm in ~330 mm long elements); longer olecranon
process (only appears to be present due to the bone's gracility);
olecranon process transversely thin (not verified in other <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span> specimens); medial ulnar
cotyle lower (I'm unsure what direction this refers to); straighter
ulnar shaft (not in MOR 693); long axes of proximal and distal ulnar
ends offset by ~45 degrees instead of ~90 (not verified in other <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span> specimens); vertical
ridge above acetabulum (also in <i>atrox</i>);
pubic boot less tall and massive (not in SMA 0005); medial surface of
low femoral head angled strongly ventrally (while initially appearing
odd, this is due to a combination of flatter medial and dorsal edges
and an actual angular difference in 20 degrees from e.g. the YPM
specimen in plate 11 of Gilmore 1920 or Madsen's 1976 UUVP coll.;
similar variation in angle and medial flatness are seen in <i>Megalosaurus
bucklandii</i>); strongly developed mediodistal crest on femur
(actually similar to some <i>A. fragilis</i>
such as UNMH VP 7884 and 12231); less curved cnemial crest (untrue of
the right tibia).  Chure and Loewen also listed straight
posteroventral jugal ramus of maxilla where it articulates with jugal
(10 degrees difference between ventral edges of posterior portion and
rest of maxilla in DINO 11541; 5 degrees in AMNH 600; 14 in USNM 4734;
16 in AMNH 666; 16 in SMA 0005; 19 in MOR 693; 26 in DINO 2560);
laterodorsal margin of nasal pinched into low crest continuous from
premaxilla to lacrimal (probably "nasals of the two species are
distinct" from Loewen 2004; seems valid- present in DINO 11541, MOR 693
and SMA 0005; not in DINO 2560, USNM 4734, or supposedly BYU 9466, UMNH
VP 7748 and 9149); posterior portion of dorsal surface of nasal
cup-shaped, producing a median peak in region of nasofrontal contact
(possibly part of "nasals of the two species are distinct" in Loewen
2004; also in USNM 4734); relatively taller lacrimal horns (also in
USNM 4734); jugal with straight to slightly-curved outline in dorsal
view (also in Loewen 2009 as "caudal portion of the skull ...
substantially increasing in transverse breadth"; also in USNM 4374);
well-developed distinct antarticular (not known to be absent in any <i>fragilis</i>
specimen).  <br>
Unfortunately, the degree of variation in <i>Allosaurus</i> specimens
is almost never mentioned by Chure (2000a) or Chure and Loewen (2020)
and very few specimens have been decently described or
illustrated.  The large scale work of Loewen (2009a) remains
unpublished and only available as abstracts.  Several of the
characters found in DINO 11541 seem to be the consequence of greater
ossification and most are comparable to intraspecific variation in
other theropods or specifically vary within specimens from each
stratigraphic level, with the best candidate for a valid character
being the narrow nasal ridges.  Even the characters that made it
to the official diagnosis of Chure and Loewen are largely absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">A. jimmadseni</span>
paratype MOR 683 they describe (row of foramina in maxillary antorbital
fossa; straight posteroventral maxillary edge; rotated and flared axial
intercentrum), present in <span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span>
neotype USNM 4734 (transversely concave posterodorsal nasal surface;
tall lacrimal horn; lateral margin of jugal straight in dorsal view),
or present in all <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
(well developed antarticular).  Given the overlap in anatomical

<i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> <b>"carnegeii"</b>- This name was used in a
caption for the cover (on page 3) of the June 2003 issue of Discover
Magazine, advertising a story inside by Levin and Gurney. As Levin near
certainly didn't write the cover description, the usually cited
authorship of "Levin, 2003" is probably in error and should be
attributed to Discover editors. It is no doubt a typo, perhaps
confusing the name with <i>Diplodocus carnegii</i>. The cover photo is
the skull and anterior cervicals of the mounted CM 11844 from the
Tithonian Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation (Carnegie
Quarry) of Utah. As detailed by McIntosh (1981), this specimen was
discovered in 1913 and the skull on the mount is a cast of DINO 2560
(then UUVP 6000). As the first two cervicals seem to be at least
partially sculpted (e.g. elongate axial neural spine), there may not
even be any real material in the cover photo. The name is certainly a
nomen nudum, lacking description (ICZN Article 13.1.1), an explicit
statement of novelty (ICZN 16.1) and explicit designation of a type
(ICZN 16.4.1). CM 11844 has never been described, but the mount has no
paraspinal lamina, relatively unexpanded chevrons and a highly
divergent metatarsal IV, so is <i>Allosaurus</i> instead of <i>Saurophaganax</i>
if these areas were based on real material. If Loewen's studies are
correct, stratigraphy would place CM 11844 and DINO 2560 as <i>A.
fragilis</i>.<br>
<b><i>Allosaurus europaeus</i></b>- Perez-Moreno et al. (1999)
described MNHNUL/AND.001 as <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>, that was later
described in detail by Malafaia et al. (2007). Ortega et al. (2009) and
Malafaia et al. (2010) mentioned and illustrated more material later
excavated from this specimen, and the latter notes a larger ilium is
preserved as well. Mateus et al. (2006) briefly described a partial
skull and cervicals as the new species <i>Allosaurus europaeus</i>,
referring MNHNUL/AND.001 based on geography although the specimens lack
overlapping elements. Malafaia et al. felt the supposed autapomorphies
for <i>A. europaeus</i> were primitive for allosauroids and/or subject
to individual variation in <i>A. fragilis</i>. My comparison confirms
this. <i>A. europaeus</i> was diagnosed by Mateus et al. based on the
following characters- maxilla forked posteriorly (also in AMNH 600);
truncated ventroposterior process of maxilla (also in AMNH 600 and DINO
11541); nasal with two pneumatic foramina (anterior foramen twice the
size of the posterior) (posterior actually larger); rugose dorsal rim
of nasal (also in many specimens such as BYU 2028 and SMA 0005);
lacrimal horn narrow in lateral view (also in UMNH 7786 and 7785);
lateral lamina of lacrimal subtle (also in AMNH 600); jugal
participation in antorbital fenestra (also in some <i>A. fragilis</i>-
Bakker pers. comm. to Carpenter and Currie, 2000; argued by Malafaia et
al., 2009 and 2010 to be a misinterpretation based on a crack instead
of a suture); posteroventral projection of jugal more than twice
posterodorsal projection (also in BYU 571/8901, DINO 11541 and USNM
4734); ventral tip of postorbital reaches lower rim of orbit (untrue,
but similar extent in BYU 571/8901); anterior tip of quadratojugal
anterior to laterotemporal fenestra (also in AMNH 600); squamosal
contacts quadratojugal in sigmoidal suture; squamosal projects
ventrally into laterotemporal fenestra (true in all <i>Allosaurus</i>);
occipital condyle above squamosal-quadratojugal contact (also in USNM
4734); palatine contacts pterygoid dorsoposteriorly (true generally in <i>Allosaurus</i>-
e.g. DINO 11541 and MOR 693); large anterior surangular foramen (also
in AMNH 4734). Only the larger posterior nasal foramen and sigmoidal
squamosal-quadratojugal suture differ from the sample of <i>A. fragilis</i>
skulls checked. Of these, the size and number of nasal foramina varies
between specimens (e.g. one foramen in DMNH 2419; two right and three
left in USNM 4734; three foramina in BYU 2028), as common for pneumatic
features. The squamosal-quadratojugal shape is also variable in <i>A.
fragilis</i>, so that it is unsurprising the sigmoid line of <i>A.
europaeus</i>' type is different from the other mutually different
examples. While one might expect European and American <i>Allosaurus</i>
to be specifically distinct, this is so far unjustified by morphology.
I follow Malafaia et al. in synonymizing the species. <br>
<i><b>Allosaurus lucasi</b></i>- The material of this species (YPM
57589) was discovered in 1953 in the Tithonian Brushy Basin Member of
the Morrison Formation in Colorado (McElmo Canyon). This was first
mentioned in an SVP abstract (Dalman et al., 2012) as a taxon "distinct
from <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Saurophaganax</i>", though phylogenetic
analysis placed it "within Allosauroidea, more closely related to <i>Allosaurus</i>,
<i>Fukuiraptor</i> and <i>Neovenator</i>." Dalman (2014) described it
as a new species of <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>A. lucasi</i>. Contrary to
Dalman et al., no CT scans or braincase are mentioned in the
description. Dalman also correctly identifies five premaxillary teeth,
whereas Dalman et al. state only four are present. Unfortunately, YPM
57589 is highly fragmentary and only partially prepared, and Dalman's
description is poorly written and full of errors. <br>
The first supposedly distinctive character (also mentioned by Dalman et
al.) is a short premaxilla, which Dalman claims is equal in length and
height. However figure 2A clearly shows the length/height ratio to be
~144%, which is actually more elongate than <i>A. fragilis</i> neotype
USNM 4734 (138%), let alone specimens with even shorter premaxillae
(e.g. 85% in AMNH 600). Both Dalman and Dalman et al. cite a short and
deep maxilla as a second derived character, but only the anterior third
is preserved so this is completely unknowable. Note that the labeled
margin of the antorbital fossa (eaof in figure 4A) is actually above
the base of the ascending process and that little if any of the
preserved section was under the actual antorbital fossa. Thus when
Dalman later states the antorbital fossa was not as ventrally extensive
in <i>lucasi</i>, he's confusing the portion below the ascending
process for the portion under the fossa, and the structure is the same
as in other <i>Allosaurus</i> specimens. Dalman lists reduced anterior
and posterior quadratojugal processes as diagnostic, but the posterior
process is equally short in e.g. AMNH 600, while the anterior process
is broken. The bone is only visible as two sagittal cross sections
still encased in matrix, and one block of matrix is missing the ventral
edge present on the other block so that the anterior process appears
shallow and more tapered (figure 6D, also used in plate 1), but the
actual bone is deeper and less tapered (rqjr in figure 6C) so
comparable to <i>A. fragilis</i>. Dalman et al. similarly list a
robust quadratojugal as diagnostic, but this is an illusion caused by
the incorrectly restored anterior process. Dalman states the ventral
margins of the anterior and posterior quadratojugal processes are on a
straight line, but the angle is 27 degrees, similar to the 32 degree
measure in USNM 4734 and more than in DINO 11541 (as Dalman himself
notes later in the text). Dalman's last diagnostic character is the
supposedly posteriorly placed lateral tibial condyle, but this is very
similar to USNM 4734 (posterior edge of condyle at 87% of
anteroposterior length in <i>lucasi</i> vs. 86% in <i>fragilis</i>). <br>
Dalman also lists numerous features supposedly different from <i>A.
fragilis</i> in the text. The anterior edge of the premaxilla is said
to be at a slightly lower angle compared to the ventral margin, but
both edges are incompletely preserved and the angle varies widely in
other <i>Allosaurus</i> specimens. The premaxillae are claimed to make
a narrower symphysis by five degrees, but this is not only within
likely individual and/or taphonomic variation, it's probably not
possible to measure that exactly in <i>lucasi</i> due to the medial
side being "cemented to the conglomeratic matrix." Dalman claims the
subnarial foramen is absent, but given the "extensive weathering of the
lateral surface" which has removed traces of neurovascular foramina,
the subnarial foramen is probably unpreserved as well. The dorsal
quadratojugal process is said to be at a right angle to the ventral
process unlike a supposed 75 degree angle in <i>A. fragilis</i>, but
some <i>fragilis</i> specimens have a right angle too (e.g. DINO
2560). The same thing can be said of the supposedly straight instead of
anteriorly bent dorsal quadratojugal process, with the added issue that
the dorsal portion is broken off. The posterior end of the quadrate is
said to be slender and that of <i>fragilis</i> robust, but so much of
the bone has been eroded away (dorsal third, mandibular condyles,
anterior portion of pterygoid wing) that the posterior width is about
the only dimension measurable, so can't be related to any other
dimension to measure robusticity. What little is preserved of the bone
shows no differences from <i>fragilis</i>. The pubic peduncle is said
to end "with a small protruding structure, which extends throughout the
entire anteroposterior length of the bone", supposedly unlike <i>A.
fragilis</i>, <i>atrox</i> or <span style="font-style: italic;">jimmadseni</span>,
but what this refers to isn't obvious from the figure. Dalman says the
pubic peduncle is shorter and more robust than <i>A. fragilis</i>, but
as only the distal end is preserved, this is impossible to evaluate.
Similarly, the supposedly more shallow posterior concavity is
impossible to know since the proximal half of the concavity is
unpreserved., and the supposedly more gracile and much thinner pubic
shaft may not be true since only two short shaft fragments are
preserved. Metatarsal I is claimed to be more massive, but its width is
~53% of metatarsal II's based on figure 18, compared to 53% in USNM
4734. Dalman is correct in stating metatarsal IV is less distally
divergent than some <i>A. fragilis</i> (e.g. AMNH 324, DINO 11541),
though this is similar to <i>Saurophaganax</i> and is also found in
some <i>fragilis</i> specimens (e.g. MOR 693). <br>
Metatarsal IV's triangular distal end identifies this as <i>Allosaurus</i>
instead of <i>Saurophaganax</i>, and Dalman's characters are
inaccurate, unknowable or fall within the range of variation of <i>A.
fragilis</i>. Thus it is referred to that species here. If Loewen's
studies are correct, YPM 57589's high stratigraphic position would keep
it referred to <i>A. fragilis</i>. <br>
Dalman also refers YPM 57726, supposed dentary and splenial fragments,
to <i>A. lucasi</i> because they and the holotype "were found in close
proximity to each other and exhibit similar morphology." The supposed
dentary fragment is from a smaller individual than the holotype, not
stated to share any characters with it to the exclusion of other <i>Allosaurus</i>,
and can't even be placed compared to the holotype dentary fragment
given the poor figures and description. Although stated to be from the
"distal" (= anterior?) portion of the dentary, there is no obvious
Meckelian groove and the tall and convex supposed splenial articular
surface is unlike any theropod. Dalman states the splenial articular
surface "is much deeper than it is in other species of <i>Allosaurus</i>",
but as no theropods have a similar structure there is more likely
misidentification to blame. The supposed splenial fragment has too
little anterior taper to be an <i>Allosaurus</i> splenial, though it
does match the middle section of an angular well. There's nothing
suggesting these fragments come from the same individual or even from <i>Allosaurus</i>.<br>
<b>Other specimens</b>- Lisak (1980) described a snout in his thesis as
<i>Allosaurus</i> cf. <i>fragilis</i> that was redescribed by Smith
and Lisak (2001). BYU 2028 is from the Tithonian Brushy Basin Member of
the Morrison Formation in Utah. The authors state it is unlike most <i>Allosaurus</i>
specimens in having a premaxilla which is taller than long, more
extensive pneumatization around the antorbital fossa, convex ventral
maxillary edge, better developed nasal ridge, and more concave ventral
dentary edge. They considered these features to be individual variation
within <i>A. fragilis</i>.<br>
MOR 693 was discovered in 1991 in the Kimmeridgian Salt Wash Member of
the Morrison Formation inWyoming (Laws, 1993). The specimen is very
complete and has been nicknamed Big Al. Big Al has been the focus of
pathological research (e.g. Laws, 1996; Breithaupt, 2001; Hanna, 2002),
though no description of its morphology has been published. Another
rather complete specimen (SMA 005/02) was discovered by the same team
in the same quarry in 1996, and is nicknamed Big Al 2. It has been
mentioned only briefly in the literature, though Evers et al. (2013)
did comment on its pathologies in an abstract, later detailed by Foth
et al. (2015).  Chure and Loewen (2020) state "SMA 0005 is
currently being described by scientists at
Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich, Germany" and will be donated
to the University of Zurich (Hotz, 2020).<br>
NMMNH P-26083 (Williamson and Chure, 1996) is a large specimen from the
Tithonian Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation in New Mexico.
Williamson and Chure merely referred it to Allosauridae, not a
particular genus. It is assigned to <i>Allosaurus</i> instead of <i>Saurophaganax</i>
because the femoral shaft is straight in anterior view, the tibial
facet for the astragalar ascending process is well marked and the
medial malleolus of the tibia is poorly expanded. P-26083's large size
invites comparison to <i>Epanterias</i>, but no preserved elements are
shared with the holotype. The strongly curved cnemial crest, twisted
tibial shaft, and flattened medial surface of the medial tibial condyle
are supposedly unique characters. However, twisted tibial shafts are
almost universal among theropods and <i>A. fragilis</i> neotype USNM
4734 also has a concave medial edge of its medial condyle. As the tibia
is not figured in proximal view, the cnemial crest's curvature cannot
be evaluated.<br>
Smith et al. (1999) described BYU 571/8901 from the Brushy Basin Member
of the Morrison Formation in Utah as an example of <i>Allosaurus
fragilis</i>. It has a perhaps pathologically fused ectopterygoid and
pterygoid (right side only), fused atlantal elements, less distinct
coracoid tuber, and humerus with greater torsion than other <i>A.
fragilis</i>. Bybee and Smith (1999) note it has an ossified
sphenethmoid, very thin parasphenoid rostrum, posteriorly oriented
basisphenoid recess, coalesced cranial nerve foramina at base of
occipital condyle, and more horizontally oriented paroccipital
processes than most <i>A. fragilis</i> as well. <br>
The referred eggs are <i>Prismatoolithus coloradensis</i> (Hirsch,
1994), as shown by Carrano et al. (2013).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Not <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span></span>-
The holotype of <i>"Laelaps" trihedrodon</i> (Cope, 1877) is lost and
was never illustrated and only briefly described, so cannot be assigned
to <i>Allosaurus</i> or another genus (Chure, 2000a; published as
Chure, 2001).<br>
The holotype of <i>Hypsirophus discurus</i> (Cope, 1878) does not
contain <i>Allosaurus</i> elements, contra Glut (1997) and Paul and
Carpenter (2010) (Chure, 2000a). <br>
Rhodes and Currie's (2020) Table 1 lists "<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span> BYUVP 17550
Fused, partial pubes (apron and boot)", but Scheetz (pers. comm.,
7-2022) reports "BYU 17550 is the <i>Ceratosaurus </i>pelvis (pelvis
consisting of 5 sacral verts, both illia, fused pair of pubes and fused
prox ends of ischia) from the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison, Dry
Mesa Quarry, western Colorado."<br>
