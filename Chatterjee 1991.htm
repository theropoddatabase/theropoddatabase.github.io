<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Sphenosuchids- Chatterjee primarily uses <i>Dibothrosuchus</i>, though he also 
  mentions <i>Sphenosuchus</i> itself. Recent analyses (e.g. Clark et al., 2004) 
  suggest Sphenosuchidae is paraphyletic, with <i>Dibothrosuchus</i> closer to 
  Crocodyliformes than <i>Sphenosuchus</i>.<br>
  Theropods- This is of course paraphyletic to the ingroup. Chatterjee mentions 
  several theropods in his comparison of <i>Protoavis</i> to that group- <i>Megapnosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, Ornithomimidae, 
  <i>Troodon</i> and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. These will be used for coding.<br>
  <i>Protoavis</i>- This taxon is now recognized as a chimaera, consisting of 
  drepanosaurid, pterosauromorph and theropod (including coelophysoid) elements. 
  The cranial material coded here is partially theropod (holotype basioccipital, 
  prootic, exoccipital, epiotic, supraoccipital), while the other (holotype premaxilla, 
  lacrimal(?), squamosal, quadrate(?), frontal, parietal, posterior mandible(?); 
  paratype maxilla, nasal(?), lacrimal, jugal, quadratojugal, quadrate(?), parietal(?), 
  basioccipital(?), vomer, palatine, pterygoid, partial dentary, posterior dentary(?), 
  posterior mandible) may include drepanosaurid or misidentified elements.</p>
<p><b>Coding Issues</b></p>
<p>1. This character (metotic structure) deserves comment. Chatterjee identifies 
  a &quot;metotic ossification&quot; in <i>Protoavis</i> which spans the area 
  between the paroccipital process and basal tubera, separating the fenestra pseudorotunda 
  from the vagus (X) nerve. This structure is seemingly part of the exoccipital-opsthotic 
  (there is no suture) and causes the vagus nerve to exit on the occipital surface. 
  This is the same as what's usually called the metotic strut in theropods, but 
  Chatterjee codes theropods as lacking the character. The text makes it clear 
  that he believes the theropod structure (which he terms a subcapsular process) 
  is non-homologous with the avian structure because Rieppel (1985) found that 
  the subcapsular process in crocodilians develops from the exoccipital while 
  the metotic strut of birds arises from a separate condensation. Yet developmental 
  processes also evolve, and the condition in theropod development is unknown 
  in any case. Even worse, the developmental origin of the structure in <i>Protoavis</i>, 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> or <i>Hesperornis</i> is also unknown, making Chatterjee's 
  coding for them as having a metotic and not a subcapsular process an a priori 
  assumption based on his &quot;knowing&quot; they are birds. As derived theropods 
  (e.g. <i>Dilophosaurus</i>- Welles, 1984; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003; 
  <i>Troodon</i>- Currie and Zhao, 1994; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- Currie, 1995) have 
  a metotic strut identical to the condition in <i>Protoavis</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, 
  <b>theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic. <i>Avimimus</i> (Kurzanov, 1986) 
  and <i>Ichthyornis</i> (Clarke, 2004) also have metotic struts. The condition 
  in <i>Protoavis</i> is illustrated by Chatterjee as having a metotic strut, 
  but comparing it to <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> suggests it's 
  possible the supposed anterior opening of the posterior tympanic recess is the 
  actual vagus nerve, while the supposed vagus foramen could be the larger of 
  two hypoglossal (XII) foramina. Witmer (2001) had no problem with the metotic 
  strut interpretation however. In any case, <b><i>Protoavis</i></b> is coded 
  unknown pending further study.</p>
<p>2. This character is the unquantified &quot;small olfactory lobes&quot;, which 
  is coded as present in all bird taxa and absent in the outgroups. Comparing 
  olfactory bulb width to cerebrum width does indeed suggest <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  has narrower bulbs (27%) than <i>Troodon</i> (32%) or <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> (48%). 
  However, <i>Avimimus</i> is described as having &quot;relatively large&quot; 
  olfactory bulbs by Kurzanov (1985) and the skull seems broken posterior to where 
  the bulbs were placed anyway, with the small triangular olfactory (I) nerve 
  foramen visible in anterior view. <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is thus recoded as 
  unknown. Edinger (1951) indicates that Marsh's (1888) endocast of <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  was largely imaginary and notes no data concerning olfactory bulb size can be 
  determined from the specimens. Whether newer specimen KUVP 71012 can shed light 
  on its morphology is unknown, as this area has not been described. <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> 
  is recoded unknown. While no ventral illustration of the frontals or dorsal/ventral 
  illustration of <i>Protoavis</i>' endocast is shown, the drawing of the brain 
  (figure 16d) by Chatterjee indicates its olfactory bulbs were ~42% as wide as 
  the cerebra. So assuming the composite endocast is even trustworthy, <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> 
  would seem to have large olfactory bulbs. It is here provisionally coded as 
  unknown. </p>
<p>3. Character 3 is cerebellar fossa extended on to supraoccipital, but contra 
  Chatterjee this is seen in even basal <b>theropods</b> (e.g. <i>Ceratosaurus</i>- 
  Sanders and Smith, 2005; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Osborn, 1913). The <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  material is far too crushed to determine this character's presence. </p>
<p>4. This character involves the presence of a cerebral vein (&quot;sinus canal&quot;) 
  penetrating the supraoccipital-epiotic suture. This is present in <b>theropods</b> 
  as well ('caudal middle cerebral vein' of <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; katentakatae</i> 
  in Tykoski, 1998; 'dorsal cerebral vein' of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> in Brochu, 
  2003; 'posterior canal of the middle cerebral vein' of <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> 
  in Currie, 1995).</p>
<p>5. <i>Troodon</i> lacks a prefrontal (Russell, 1969), making <b>theropods</b> 
  polymorphic. The condition in <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is uncertain, as no specimen 
  preserves that area. The presence of this bone is uncertain in <b><i>Protoavis</i></b>, 
  as the lacrimal is preserved attached to the maxilla, while the frontal is not 
  just preserved separately, but comes from a different larger individual. Thus 
  they cannot be articulated, and the frontal itself only seems to bear an anterior 
  (nasal?) articular surface, with no apparent lateral articular surface for a 
  lacrimal and/or prefrontal. </p>
<p>6. Chatterjee's next character is confusing. It is &quot;braincase: (basioccipital-basisphenoid-parasphenoid 
  complex): (0) vertical; (1) horizontal.&quot; Chatterjee elaborates by discussing 
  the outgroups' braincase as deep, but birds' as flat. Yet the braincase of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  does not differ much from <i>Troodon</i>'s in overall proportions. The ventral 
  braincase of most small theropods (<i>Megapnosaurus</i>, <i>Troodon</i>, etc.) 
  is basically horizontal, with an anteriorly directed parasphenoid cultriform 
  process. Most theropods' ventral braincase is deeper than birds' due to a vertically 
  deep basisphenoid sinus, and even taxa like <i>Troodon</i> which lack an external 
  sinus have deep internal sinuses there. Unfortunately, sinus depth is difficult 
  to measure in most specimens, though coelophysids have shallower sinuses than 
  other theropods (Raath, 1989). <i>Protoavis</i> has a sinus on the ventral surface 
  of its supposed basioccipital, though the depth of the element is never illustrated. 
  It would resemble coelophysids if not for the supposed basisphenoid (Witmer, 
  2001 doubted its identity) from a different individual with its small basipterygoid 
  processes. The reason for coding <i>Archaeopteryx</i> as derived is uncertain, 
  as the Munich specimen is the only one which preserves this area and was not 
  known until after Chatterjee's paper was published. In any case, its deep basipterygoid 
  processes suggest a deep sinus if anything (Elzanoski and Wellnhofer, 1996). 
  <i>Avimimus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> are also unknown, as their articulated 
  braincases do not allow ventral depth to be measured. <i>Dibothrosuchus</i> 
  has a deep basisphenoid like theropods, though due to the ventrally projecting 
  basipterygoid processes, as it lacks a ventral basisphenoid sinus. The question 
  remains how to code this character. The condition in most theropods is non-homologous 
  with sphenosuchids, <i>Protoavis</i> may resemble coelophysids, and <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  has a flat morphology due to lacking promiment basipterygoid processes or a 
  ventral sinus. It is here deleted (so <b>all eight taxa</b> are recoded as unknown), 
  though basiphenoid sinus depth or basipterygoid process size might be good substitutes.</p>
<p>7. This character involves the external naris being posteriorly placed, and 
  indeed <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, <i>Gobipteryx</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i> have more 
  posteriorly placed nares than the included avetheropods (distance from snout 
  tip to front of nares 20% or more of height of orbit+jugal). But <i>Megapnosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> have nares placed more posteriorly than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, 
  making <b>theropods</b> polymorphic. The condition in <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  is unknown as the described premaxillary fragment does not indicate the nares' 
  anterior edge. <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> actually has a rostrally placed naris 
  based on the illustrated premaxilla and posterior skull of the large individual, 
  though Chatterjee changed this for his cranial reconstruction to more closely 
  resemble birds.</p>
<p>8. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> has a complete postorbital, which probably contacted 
  the jugal (Tischlinger, 2005). The condition in <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is 
  unpreserved. <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> is supposed to lack a postorbital based 
  on a lack of facets on the frontal and squamosal, which were confirmed by Witmer 
  (2001). Yet the laterosphenoid has a large capitate process (termed the postorbital 
  process by Chatterjee) with what appears to be an articular surface, which fits 
  into a socket on the postorbital in most theropods. The jugal is described as 
  having only a rudimentary dorsal process, though the original material is only 
  illustrated in ventral view. Thus there is not a complete lack of postorbital 
  articular surfaces, and the evidence is contradictory. Perhaps being such a 
  small or juvenile individual, <i>Protoavis</i> did not have a strongly attached 
  postorbital. For now, it is tentatively coded as unknown.</p>
<p>9. This character (maxillary tooth row ends anterior to antorbital fenestra) 
  is coded as an autapomorphy of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, making it useless for the 
  analysis and artificially increasing the CI. However, <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  actually lacks this character as shown by the Eichstatt specimen (Paul, 2002). 
  Even worse, <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> and <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> are coded as 
  lacking it, despite not having maxillary dentition at all! Similarly, even if 
  the premaxillary denticles of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> are interpreted as teeth 
  (contra Vickers-Rich et al., 2002), the maxilla is unpreserved. <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  only preserves a small maxillary fragment of uncertain position (Clarke, 2004). 
  All of these taxa should be coded as unknown. The condition in <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> 
  is difficult to code, as a medial antorbital wall which defines the antorbiral 
  fenestra anteriorly in more basal theropods is generally thought to be absent 
  (Witmer, 1990). Even if the palatine process is homologous, without it extending 
  dorsally, there is no way to judge an anterior boundary to the antorbital fenestra. 
  <i>Hesperornis</i> is thus recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>10. The fused quadratojugal and quadrate in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> make judging 
  the presence of a dorsal quadratojugal process impossible. Neither <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> 
  or <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> preserve the quadratojugal, so are both recoded 
  as unknown. The quadratojugal of <i>Protoavis</i> is posterodorsally curved 
  in the material, unlike Chatterjee's reconstruction. This posterodorsal section 
  would seem to be a valid dorsal process, so <b><i>Protoavis</i></b> is recoded.</p>
<p>11. This character (premaxillary teeth present but anterior dentary teeth absent) 
  is another supposed autapomorphy, and is problematic for being a composite as 
  well. It combines a primitive state for one element (premaxillary teeth present) 
  with a derived one from another element (anterior dentary teeth absent). The 
  latter is also present in some <b>theropods</b> (e.g. ornithomimids) and <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i>, 
  so those are changed to polymorphic and derived respectively. The condition 
  in <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> is uncertain, as the one anterior dentary fragment 
  seems broken at both ends, making its position unknown.</p>
<p>12. This character (temporal configuration fully modified) is correlated with 
  character 8 (diapsid temporal configuration partially modified). Thus all taxa 
  coded 0 for character 8 (sphenosuchids, theropods, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>) are 
  coded unknown. <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> and <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> are again 
  coded as unknown.</p>
<p>13. Chatterjee's 13th character is &quot;alaparasphenoid covers anterior tympanic 
  recess.&quot; The alaparasphenoid of birds is homologous to the structure variously 
  called the crista prootica, otosphenoidal crest, ala basisphenoid and preotic 
  pendent in theropods. In some theropods (e.g. <i>Allosaurus</i>- Chure, 2000; 
  <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003), this covers the anterior tympanic recess. 
  <b>Theropods</b> are thus recoded as polymorphic. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has only 
  a small ridge, so is coded as plesiomorphic. While the supposed alaparasphenoid 
  of <i>Protoavis</i> (on the possible basisphenoid) does not seem to have much 
  projection posterodorsally to cover the anterior tympanic recess, the prootic 
  fragment has a dorsal overhang (figure 12f) that is similar to that in <i>Megapnosaurus</i>. 
</p>
<p>14. Chatterjee codes the zygomatic process of the squamosal as lacking in theropods, 
  but it is homologous to the quadratojugal process, which is present in almost 
  all theropods. <b>Theropods</b> are recoded as having the process. Fusion makes 
  its presence in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> uncertain (Kurzanov, 1987), while <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  has the process (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996). The squamosal of <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> 
  is unknown. The squamosal of <i>Protoavis</i> is described as having a zygomatic 
  process, but this is clearly the anterior process instead, as it is the one 
  Chatterjee notes is peculiar in lacking a postorbital facet. Thus assuming it 
  is complete, <i> <b>Protoavis</b></i> actually lacks a significant ventral process.</p>
<p>15. Witmer (2001) notes the supposed quadratojugal cotyla of <i><b>Protoavis</b></i>' 
  quadrate is subtle and &quot;not all that different&quot; from other theropods 
  such as <i>Deinonychus</i> or juvenile tyrannosaurids. It is thus recoded as 
  absent. The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is uncertain, as the quadratojugal 
  is fused to the quadrate. The area of contact is unpreserved in <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i>'s 
  quadrate (Elzanowski, 1977). </p>
<p>16. This character (orbital process of quadrate present) involves the pterygoid's 
  articulation with the quadrate more than the quadrate's structure itself, as 
  sphenosuchians and theropods both have the homolog to an orbital process (the 
  pterygoid process). Yet in derived birds, the pterygoid only articulates with 
  the quadrate ventrally, leaving the former pterygoid process free. The condition 
  in <i>Protoavis</i> is difficult to determine, as Witmer (2001) noted the supposed 
  pterygoid condyle of the quadrate was not present. The pterygoid's quadrate 
  ramus is described as a narrow bar though, which would indeed have trouble articulating 
  in a broad overlapping suture typical of theropods. <i>Protoavis</i>' derived 
  coding is tentatively retained.</p>
<p>17. This character (pterygoid condyle present on quadrate) is correlated with 
  the previous one, as only a taxon with a free orbital process will have a pterygoid 
  condyle. Thus sphenosuchids, theropods, <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Avimimus</i> 
  are all recoded as unknown. As noted above, the pterygoid condyle on <i>Protoavis</i>' 
  quadrate is not there according to Witmer (2001), so <b><i>Protoavis</i></b> 
  is changed to plesiomorphic. </p>
<p>18. <b><i>Gobipteryx</i></b> (Chiappe et al., 2001) and <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> 
  (Witmer, 1990) have large dorsal maxillary processes, so are recoded. That of 
  <i>Protoavis</i> was originally illustrated as broken off (although described 
  as absent), but Chatterjee (1999) later described a new element as the maxilla, 
  this time with a large dorsal process (illustrated in Chatterjee, 1998). Assuming 
  this is really a maxilla, it does indeed have a large process. <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> 
  is recoded.</p>
<p>19. This character involves cranial kinesis, which is especially difficult 
  to demonstrate in fossils (Holliday and Witmer, 2008). Specifically, it involves 
  prokinesis, which needs several components to function- mobile joints at the 
  nasofrontal, quadrato-otic, quadrato-quadratojugal, maxillojugal and anterior 
  palate, and loss of a connecting postorbital, epipterygoid and ectopterygoid. 
  Based on their criteria, <i>Gobipteryx</i> probably lacked prokinesis due to 
  its ectopterygoid so would need to be recoded. The condition in <i>Protoavis</i> 
  is complicated by incompleteness and uncertain identification. The nasofrontal 
  joint does indeed seem to be reduced, and like most theropods the quadrate has 
  a synovial joint with the sqmousal. While perhaps not a true ball and socket 
  joint, the quadrate-quadratojugal articulation is loose and convexoconcave. 
  However, the maxilla appears to have a broad, forked articulation with the jugal. 
  The evidence it lacked a postorbital is ambiguous (see above), and the absence 
  of small elements such as epipterygoids and ectopterygoids even more so. Note 
  this character is correlated with characters 8, 10, 12, 15, 16 and 20, so is 
  deleted and all seven taxa recoded unknown.</p>
<p>20. The ectopterygoid is present in <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> (Elzanowski, 1995), 
  while its absence in <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> cannot be demonstrated given the 
  disarticulation of the material.</p>
<p>21. Clarke (2004) notes both <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> and <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  have a bicondylar quadrate, with the supposed caudal condyle being a posterior 
  continuation of a single medial condylar surface. The tricondylar quadrate of 
  <i>Protoavis</i> is supposedly illustrated in figure 11 of Chatterjee's 1991 
  paper, but that figure is actually missing. Still, the paratype quadrate is 
  illustrated in his 1998 paper as being tricondylar, so is provisionally still 
  coded that way. Witmer (2001) notes the holotype's quadrate seems to lack mandibular 
  condyles at all.</p>
<p>22. Like character 11, this is both a useless autapomorphy, and also a composite 
  character. Supposedly an apomorphy of <i>Protoavis</i>, it is &quot;teeth restricted 
  to tips of premaxilla and dentary.&quot; The two illustrated premaxillary alveoli 
  are in the middle of the bone, while Chatterjee describes a total of three alveoli 
  which are &quot;in front.&quot; Chatterjee claims there were only two anteriorly 
  placed dentary teeth, but the only section of dentary preserved which would 
  be expected to have teeth is from an unknown position and is associated with 
  three disarticulated teeth (one supposedly a replacement tooth). Assuming it 
  is even a dentary and the teeth belong to that bone, there is no way of knowing 
  how they were distributed. The potentially toothless posterior portion of the 
  premaxilla is matched by some theropods such as coelophysoids, while <i>Avimimus</i>, 
  <i>Gobipteryx,</i> <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> lack premaxillary 
  teeth entirely. Thus <b><i>Protoavis</i></b> is tentatively coded as lacking 
  posterior premaxillary teeth, <b>theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic, and 
  <i> <b>Gobipteryx</b></i>, <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> and <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  are coded as apomorphic (<i><b>Avimimus</b></i>' posterior premaxillae are unpreserved).</p>
<p>23. The nasals do not contact on the median in <i>Ichthyornis</i> (Clarke, 
  2004).</p>
<p>24. This character (nasal process of premaxillae extend posteriorly to lacrimals) 
  is directly correlated with the previous one (nasals do not contact on median), 
  as the premaxillae are what separates the nasals from one another. It is therefore 
  deleted and the eight coded taxa recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>25. The mesethmoid is ossified in many theropods (e.g. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- 
  Hurum and Sabath, 2003; <i>Troodon</i>- Ali et al., 2008; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- 
  Currie, 1995), so <b>Theropoda</b> is recoded as polymorphic. <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  also has this element (Kurzanov, 1981), as does <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> (Clarke, 
  2004). Its presence in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> and <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> 
  is uncertain due to the lack of articulated material in the latter and easy 
  separation from the laterosphenoids and frontals.</p>
<p>26. This is another useless autapomorphy, and yet again the taxon in question 
  (<i><b>Hesperornis</b></i>) does not exhibit the feature (pterygoid process 
  fits into basisphenoid facet), as <i>Hesperornis</i> has low but convex basipterygoid 
  processes (Elzanowski, 1991). The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is uncertain 
  due to fusion (Kurzanov, 1987), while the condition in <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  is uncertain as the basipterygoid area is unpreserved (Clarke, 2004). </p>
<p>27. Another autapomorphy that <i>Hesperornis</i> does not in fact possess, 
  and a composite character to boot- &quot;combination of short, complex pterygoid 
  with narrow, elongate palatine.&quot; Chatterjee misidentifies the palatal elements 
  of <i>Hesperornis</i> (Chatterjee, 1991), which only appears to have a short 
  pterygoid because of the unfused anterior portion (hemipterygoid of Elzanowski). 
  The real palatine of <i>Hesperornis</i> is indeed narrow and elongate, but those 
  of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i>, <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> and <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  are unpreserved. The palate of <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> is very difficult to 
  intrepret, but the supposed choana makes more sense as a suborbital fenestra 
  given its position behind the maxillojugal suture. Any coding regarding the 
  shape of its palatines should be changed to unknown.</p>
<p>28. This character (pterygoid condyle of quadrate large) is correlated with 
  character 17 (pterygoid condyle present), so any taxa scored as 0 for 17 (sphenosuchids, 
  theropods, <i>Protoavis</i>, <i>Avimimus</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>) should be 
  coded unknown for this one. However, the character is still a useless autapomorphy, 
  being found only in <i>Ichthyornis</i>.</p>
<p>29. This character (toothless jaws) is correlated with parts of 11 (dentary 
  teeth absent) and 22 (posterior premaxillary teeth, maxillary teeth, and posterior 
  dentary teeth absent). It is intended as an apomorphy of <i>Gobipteryx</i>, 
  making it useless. However, as <i>Gobipteryx</i> differs from most included 
  taxa by lacking maxillary teeth specifically, that portion of the character 
  is retained for this analysis. <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> apparently also lacks 
  maxillary teeth, so is recoded. Some <b>theropods</b> (e.g. ornithomimids) lack 
  them as well, and <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> does not preserve the maxilla.</p>
<p>30. The final character is another useless apomorphy of <i>Gobipteryx</i>- 
  dentary symphysis fused. <i><b>Protoavis</b></i> cannot be scored for it, as 
  the anteriormost dentary portion is unpreserved. </p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This is a highly flawed analysis. It only 
  uses characters from one area of the body, which makes it less reliable. Also, 
  it only uses characters which are known in <i>Protoavis</i>, a trend which is 
  common when authors are trying to phylogenetically place their taxon under study. 
  Yet characters unpreserved in <i>Protoavis</i> could nonetheless strongly support 
  the topology of the tree, which will in turn affect character distribution and 
  thus <i>Protoavis</i>' placement. The characters are all designed to support 
  certain clades, so this is another cladistic demonstration instead of a cladistic 
  analysis. Having an all-zero outgroup is generally flawed, and in this case 
  theropods should be scored as 0/1 or for 11 (37%) of the characters, though 
  sphenosuchids do indeed seem to be coded correctly as all zero. Nine of the 
  characters (30%!) are designed to be autapomorphies, which do not influence 
  the analysis at all, making the already small matrix even smaller. 6 (20%) of 
  the characters are correlated with other characters. Characters 11, 22 and 27 
  are especially poorly formed, as they involve the morphology of more than one 
  element each. Several times Chatterjee assumes non-homology between avian and 
  theropod features (metotic strut, alaparasphenoid, zygomatic process) and codes 
  as if this assumption were necessarily true. Taxa are commonly coded for elements 
  they do not preserve (especially <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Gobipteryx</i>) or 
  for characters which are inapplicable (tooth characters in toothless taxa, articulation 
  characters in taxa with fusion). In total, 110/240 (46%) of the characters are 
  miscoded. When recoded, the new result is-</p>

  parsimony-informative characters left.</p>
<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Chatterjee's original matrix, 
  and his recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is already most 
  parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it.</p>

<p>Neither the original or recoded analysis provides much support at all for placing 
  <i>Avimimus</i> closer to modern birds than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The original 
  analysis did provide moderate support for placing <i>Protoavis</i> in this position, 
  but once recoded its position relative to <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is basically 
  ambiguous. Sauriurae was rejected with moderate confidence originally, but recoding 
  has made this support weak. Basically, Chatterjee's matrix is too small to securely 
  reject any plausible hypothesis.</p>
<p><b>Experiments with controversial taxa</b>- It's somewhat pointless to add 
  more taxa to a matrix with such little power to resolve relationships. One question 
  might be if resolution is improved by deleting the chimaerical <i>Protoavis</i>. 
  Another is if more basal oviraptorosaur such as <i>Incisivosaurus</i> would 
  cause <i>Avimimus</i> to be excluded from birds. If <i>Protoavis</i> includes 
  some drepanosaurid elements, adding <i>Megalancosaurus</i> to the matrix might 
  be informative. Finally, it is odd that Chatterjee excluded modern Aves. Deleting 
  <i>Protoavis</i> has no effect on tree topology or resolution. <i>Megalancosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Incisivosaurus</i> and Aves were all added as OTUs. The resulting tree is-</p>

<p><i>Avimimus</i> still falls out as a bird, though <i>Gobipteryx</i> has a more 
  stable position more derived than <i>Protoavis</i>. The fact <i>Megalancosaurus</i> 
  falls out by <i>Protoavis</i> within Theropoda is yet more indication this matrix 
  is insufficient to test phylogenies. <i>Megalancosaurus</i> is excluded from 
  Theropoda with 1 more step.</p>
