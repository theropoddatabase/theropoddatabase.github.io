<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Dromaeosauridae- The text states this is only based on <i>Deinonychus</i>.<br>
  <i>Iberomesornis</i>- This is recognized today as being a member of Enantiornithes.<br>
  Enantiornithes- This is based on <i>Alexornis, Avisaurus, </i><i>Enantiornis, 
  Gobipteryx, Kizylkumavis, Lectavis, Martinavis? vincei</i> (unnamed at the time), 
  <i>Nanantius, Neuquenornis, Sazavis, Soroavisaurus, Yungavolucris</i> and the 
  unnamed PVL material. While Chiappe and Calvo state <i>Cathayornis</i> (= <i>Sinornis</i>) 
  is a &quot;putative enantiornithine&quot;, they also state &quot;further studies 
  are necessary to confirm its alocation to the clade&quot; and do not seem to 
  have used it to code based on obvious characters such as the presence of premaxillary 
  teeth or a pygostyle. The holotype of <i>Sinornis</i> was not included even 
  in the 1996 version, while <i>Concornis</i> was included in 1996 but seems absent 
  in earlier versions since Sanz et al. (1995) added it to the matrix as a separate 
  OTU. All of the above taxa with the possible exception of <i>Lectavis</i> are 
  recognized today as enantiornithines.<br>
  Hesperornithiformes- This is more commonly called Hesperornithes now. According 
  to Chiappe's more detailed 1996 paper, this is based on <i>Baptornis</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i> 
  and <i>Hesperornis</i>.<br>
  Neornithes- I follow most current authors in calling this crown clade Aves. 
  Again according to Chiappe (1996), this is based on 34 recent species in 31 
  families, the basalmost of which are <i>Rhynchotus, Pterocnemia, Struthio, Chauna, 
  Amazonetta, Branta</i> and <i>Bonasa</i>.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Coding Issues</b></p>
<p>3. <i>Patagopteryx</i> has nasal processes of its premaxillae which extend 
  to the frontals (Chiappe, 2002).</p>
<p>4. <i>Ichthyornis</i> lacks premaxillary teeth (Lamb, 1997). </p>
<p>5. The external nares in Enantiornithes (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- Chiappe et al., 
  2001) are smaller than their antorbital fenestra. In addition, this is true 
  of <i>Parahesperornis</i> (Martin, 1984) and some basal avians such as <i>Anas</i> 
  (Digimorph), so <b>Hesperornithes</b> and <b>Aves</b> are recoded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>6. The caudal maxillary sinus of <i>Hesperornis</i> and Aves may be homologous 
  to the maxillary fenestra, but is not coded as such here.</p>
<p>7. The naris does not extend posteriorly to the level of the jugal in enantiornithines 
  (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- Chiappe et al., 2001) or <b>hesperornithines</b> (<i>Parahesperornis</i>- 
  Martin, 1984; <i>Hesperornis</i>- Witmer, 1990).</p>
<p>8. <b>Enantiornithines</b> (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- Elzanowski, 1995) have ectopterygoids. 
  The uncinate in <i>Hesperornis</i> and some avians may be homologous, but their 
  apomorphic coding is tentatively retained.</p>
<p>9. The orbital process of the quadrate is broken off in <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  (Clarke, 2004), making its pointedness unknown.</p>
<p>11. The presence of braincase contact with the quadrate in <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> 
  is unknown, though it is present in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Elzanowski, 
  2002).</p>
<p>12. The presence of quadrate pneumaticity in <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> is unknown. 
  It is present in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Alonso et al., 2004).</p>
<p>13. <i>Patagopteryx</i> lacks articular pneumaticity (Chiappe, 1996).</p>
<p>14. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) and <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> 
  (Sereno, 2000) have large anterior dorsal hypapophyses. Enantiornithines are 
  tentatively retained as having them, presumably based on Lecho material.</p>
<p>16. This character (less than eleven dorsal vertebrae) is correlated with character 
  15 (less than thirteen dorsal vertebrae), so taxa coded as lacking character 
  15 (<i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>) are coded unknown 
  for this one.</p>
<p>17. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> is polymorphic for this character, as its anterior 
  dorsals do have neural canals over 40% of central height (Ostrom, 1969). </p>
<p>19. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> should be coded unknown, as related taxa often 
  have heterocoely confined to anterior cervicals, and only amphicoelous posterior 
  cervicals are known.</p>
<p>20. Enantiornithines have a pygostyle (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>22. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> has uncinate processes (Paul, 2002), while <b>enantiornithines</b> 
  are best coded unknown as no taxon used by Chiappe has a complete enough ribcage 
  to code.</p>
<p>23. The scapulocoracoid articulation is narrow in <i>Iberomesornis</i> (Sereno, 
  2000).</p>
<p>24. <i>Iberomesornis</i> lacks a procoracoid process (Sereno, 2000).</p>
<p>26. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i>' coracoid is exposed in ventral view, so that 
  the level of the scapular articulation is unknown (Sereno, 2000). </p>
<p>27. <i>Iberomesornis</i>' coracoid foramen is displaced medially (perhaps to 
  the point where it no longer penetrates the bone) (Sereno, 2000).</p>
<p>28. Since <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i>' coracoid articulation is not preserved, 
  it is unknown what angle the scapula articulated at (Sereno, 2000). <i><b>Patagopteryx</b></i> 
  has a short proximal portion of the coracoid which articulates at a low angle 
  to the scapula (Chiappe, 2002), as in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. As palaeognaths 
  primitively lack a coracoid which is angled sharply from the scapula, <b>Aves</b> 
  is recoded to be polymorphic. </p>
<p>30. Since palaeognaths primitively have straight scapulae, <b>Aves</b> is recoded 
  as polymorphic. </p>
<p>31. The sternum of <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> is unpreserved, so it cannot be 
  coded for sternal size and shape. <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> actually has a broad 
  sternum only ~1.32 times longer than wide (Chiappe, 2004). </p>
<p>32. No <b>enantiornithine</b> used by Chiappe is preserved well enough to exclude 
  the possibility it had gastralia, nor are <b><i>Patagopteryx</i></b>, <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  or <b>hesperornithines</b>. </p>
<p>33. The sterna of <b><i>Deinonychus</i></b> and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  are unpreserved, so cannot be coded for the presence of a sternal keel. <i>Iberomesornis</i> 
  has a sternal keel (Sereno, 2000). Again, palaeognaths primitively lack the 
  character, so <b>Aves</b> is coded as polymorphic. </p>
<p>34. Hesperornithines (<i>Hesperornis</i>- Marsh, 1880) have wide interclavicular 
  angles. The clavicular fragments of <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> do not allow the 
  interclavicular angle to be estimated (Clarke, 2004). </p>
<p>35. <b>Enantiornithines</b> are polymorphic for the presence of a twist in 
  the humeral shaft, as <i>Neuquenornis</i> lacks this (Chiappe and Calvo, 1994).</p>
<p>36. <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> has an ulnohumeral ratio of 96%, comparable to 
  the Munich <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, so is coded as plesiomorphic. <b>Aves</b> is 
  best coded as polymorphic, since palaeognaths, <i>Anas</i> and others have short 
  ulnae.</p>
<p>37. Both <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Elzanowski, 2002) and <i>Iberomesornis</i> (coding 
  in Chiappe, 2001) have anteriorly concave humeral heads. <b>Aves</b> should 
  be coded as polymorphic, as basal palaeognaths (<i>Struthio</i>, <i>Rhea</i>, 
  <i>Apteryx</i>- codings in Livezey and Zusi, 2007) also have the plesiomorphic 
  condition.</p>
<p>38. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> (Ostrom, 1969) and <i>Patagopteryx</i> (Chiappe, 
  1996) have capital grooves on their humeri. </p>
<p>39. The transverse ligamental groove is coded as absent in palaeognaths and 
  galloanserines by Livezey and Zusi (2007), so is here coded absent in <b>Aves</b>. 
</p>
<p>40. Sereno (2000) notes that in <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i>' humerus, the radial 
  condyle is missing and the ulnar condyle at least rounds into the cranial surface. 
  It is best coded as unknown due to the poor preservation. </p>
<p>42. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>'s radius can be slightly less than 70% of ulnar 
  width (Wellnhofer, 1974; 1993), making it polymorphic. <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i>' 
  radius is over 70% of ulnar width (Clarke, 2004). <b>Aves</b> should be polymorphic, 
  as paleognaths primitively have broad radii.</p>
<p>44. <b>Enantiornithines</b> do not have an extensor process (<i>Enantiornis</i>- 
  Chiappe and Walker, 2002; <i>Neuquenornis</i>- Chiappe and Calvo, 1994), merely 
  a convex medial margin to their metacarpal I. </p>
<p>45. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> has a partially fused pelvis, as the puboischial 
  suture is fused (Sanz et al., 2002). <b>Enantiornithines</b> should be coded 
  as polymorphic, since <i>Gobipteryx</i> lacks at least iliopubic and ilioischial 
  fusion (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>46. <i>Iberomesornis</i> has an acetabulum 18% of ilial length (Sereno, 2000), 
  so is coded as plesiomorphic.</p>
<p>47. This character (ilium, pubis and ischium subparallel) is partly correlated 
  with character 55 (pubis retroverted more than 45 degrees past vertical), as 
  any taxon with 47 must have 55. Thus it is here restricted to the ischial portion.</p>
<p>48. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> has a large ilial antitrochanter (Novas, 1996). 
  <b>Enantiornithines</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Gobipteryx</i> lacks the character 
  (Kurochkin, 1996). </p>
<p>50. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> is polymorphic for the presence of a cuppedicus 
  fossa on the ilium (Elzanowski, 2002). </p>
<p>51. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lacks an ischial symphysis (e.g. coding in Turner 
  et al., 2007 and Hutchinson, 2001).</p>
<p>52. Enantiornithes (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- Kurochkin, 1996) have a pubic symphysis. 
  The pubis of <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> is distally incomplete (Clarke, 2004), 
  making it impossible to code for this character.</p>
<p>53. <i>Iberomesornis</i> (Sereno, 2000; Sanz et al., 2002) and enantiornithines 
  (<i>Gobipteryx</i>- coding in Clarke and Norell, 2002) have non-compressed pubic 
  shafts. </p>
<p>54. Enantiornithines should be coded as lacking a pubic boot based on <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  (Kurochkin, 1996). This distal pubis is unpreserved in <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  (Clarke, 2004). </p>
<p>55. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' pubic angle is uncertain as the proximal pubis 
  is unpreserved (Ostrom, 1976). </p>
<p>56. <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> has a capital ligament fossa in its femur (coding 
  in Senter, 2007). </p>
<p>58. <i>Iberomesornis</i> lacks a patellar groove (Chiappe, 1996).</p>
<p>59. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> does not have a distally closed popliteal fossa (coding 
  in Clark et al., 2002).</p>
<p>60. This is a composite character, coding for confluence between the lateral 
  condyle and ectocondylar tuber (to form a tibiofibular crest) in the second 
  state, and for the posterior projection of this crest in the third state. Chiappe 
  (2002) states <i>Patagopteryx</i> has a tibiofibular crest, and the illustration 
  shows it is not prominent. </p>
<p>61. <i>Iberomesornis</i> has a posterior trochanter (Sereno, 2000). </p>
<p>62. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> has been reinterpreted as having a completely 
  fused tibiotarsus (Sereno, 2000). The coding for Enantiornithes is retained, 
  though <i>Gobipteryx</i> has only partial fusion between its tibia and astragalocalcaneum 
  (Kurochkin, 1996). This may be a juvenile character, as other young enantiornithines 
  and <i>Baptornis</i> are known to lack fusion as well.</p>
<p>63. <b>Enantiornithes</b> is coded as polymorphic for the precence of two cnemial 
  crests, as <i>Alexornis</i> has this character (Brodkorb, 1976). </p>
<p>64. <i><b>Patagopteryx</b></i> has been reinterpreted as lacking an extensor 
  canal on its tibiotarsus, with the structure being merely the depressed area 
  between retinaculum extensor tubercles (Clarke and Norell, 2002). </p>
<p>65. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has a laterally oriented iliofibularis tubercle (coding 
  in Hutchinson, 2002). This also seems true in enantiornithines, based on <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  where there is a scar on the lateral surface but no raised tubercle (Kurochkin, 
  1996). </p>
<p>68. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> has no free distal tarsals (Sereno, 2000).</p>
<p>69. The character &quot;metatarsal fusion starting distally&quot; can only 
  apply in those taxa which have distal metatarsal fusion, which is covered by 
  character 67. Thus the taxa lacking distal fusion (<i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>, 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>, <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> and <b>Enantiornithes</b>) 
  are recoded as unknown for this character.</p>
<p>70. <i>Iberomesornis</i> lacks metatarsal V (Sereno, 2000). As <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  specimens are largely disarticulated and only preserve one pedal phalanx and 
  no metatarsal Is, the absence of metatarsal V is uncertain in this genus.</p>
<p>73. <b>Enantiornithes</b> is coded as polymorphic, as <i>Avisaurus gloriae</i> 
  (Varricchio and Chiappe, 1995) has an enclosed distal vascular foramen. <b>Hesperornithines</b> 
  should be coded as plesiomorphic, as basal taxa like <i>Baptornis</i> (Martin 
  and Tate, 1976) and <i>Parahesperornis</i> (Bell and Everhart, 2009) lack enclosed 
  distal vascular foramina.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This was quite a good analysis in many 
  ways. It had a decent number of characters, only three of which are correlated 
  with others and only one of which is a composite. Most characters are also quantified 
  well so that they are unambiguous. One issue is that since every character is 
  coded as present in Aves, the analysis is predisposed to find a topology where 
  every taxon forms a successively closer sistergroup to Aves. This almost eliminates 
  the possibility of finding combinations like Sauriurae, an Enantiornithes including 
  <i>Iberomesornis</i>, or Odontornithes. Only 15% (90/584) of the matrix was 
  miscoded. Many of these are due to discoveries since 1994 such as <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  postcrania (Kurochkin, 1996) and more complete skulls (Chiappe et al., 2001), 
  and the restudy of <i>Iberomesornis</i> by Sereno (2000). Another recurring 
  issue is the coding for Aves, which is different here due to the recent recognition 
  tinamous are nested deep in Palaeognathae, making ratite anatomy influence the 
  calculated basal state of the clade. Of course, taxa like lithornithids show 
  that Chiappe's view of ratite morphology being a reversal is almost certainly 
  correct, but this should not be assumed given only the taxa he examined combined 
  with a modern topology. Once recoded, the new topology is-</p>
<pre>|--Deinonychus
|--Archaeopteryx
`--Ornithothoraces
   |--Iberomesornis
   |--Enantiornithes
   `--Ornithuromorpha
      |--Patagopteryx
      `--+--Hesperornithes
         |--Ichthyornis
         `--Aves
</pre>
<p>Thus the only difference is that <i>Iberomesornis</i> is in a polytomy with 
  enantiornithines and ornithuromorphs, and the tree is now compatible with the 
  current consensus. </p>
<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Chiappe and Calvo's original matrix, 
  and his recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is already most 
  parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it. 86 82</p>

</table>
<p>Both the original codings and the recodings very strongly reject Sauriurae. 
  <i>Iberomesornis</i> is moderately supported as being outside Enantiornithes+Aves 
  in the old matrix, but its position relative to those groups is now ambiguous. 
  Placing <i>Patagopteryx</i> in Aves (as it was originally thought to be) or 
  making it a hesperornithine are both strongly rejected by both matrices. An 
  enantiornithine <i>Patagopteryx</i> is only moderately rejected by both though. 
  Cracraft's old topology placing hesperornithines outside Ornithothoraces is 
  strongly rejected by both matrices. The interrelationships of <i>Ichthyornis</i>, 
  hesperornithines and avians are ambiguous in both versions.</p>
