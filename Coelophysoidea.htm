<p><b><a name="Avepoda"></a>Avepoda</b> Paul, 2002<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (metatarsal I does not contact distal tarsals
homologous with <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i>) (modified from Paul, 2002)<br>
= Paleotheropoda Paul, 1988<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This clade was first suggested by Paul (1988) as a
more appropriate name for Theropoda (as their feet are birdlike as
opposed to beastlike), though he recognized Theropoda could not be
renamed. In his later 2002 book, Paul actually proposed Avepoda as a
subgroup of Theropoda, for those "that either possessed a foot in which
metatarsal I did not contact the distal tarsals, or descended from such
theropods, and belonged to a clade which includes Neotheropoda." The
definition is here modified by using <i>Allosaurus fragilis</i> as the
internal specifier, as that taxon is the official internal specifier of
Theropoda. Avepoda has almost exclusively been used by Paul, with other
authors using Neotheropoda (sensu Sereno) for the group since the two
usually have the same known content (though Avepoda is near certainly
more inclusive than Neotheropoda sensu Sereno, unless coelophysoids
were the first theropods to develop the tridactyl pes). However, <i>Procompsognathus</i>
was an avepod possibly outside the <i>Coelophysis</i>+<i>Passer</i>
clade in Paul's (1988) phylogeny and Gauthier's (1986) analysis, as was
<i>Liliensternus</i> in the latter. More recently, <i>Liliensternus</i>
was found to be outside the <i>Coelophysis</i>+<i>Passer</i> clade in
Bittencourt Rodrigues' (2010) thesis. A different complication arises
in Martinez et al.'s (2011) cladogram, where the tetradactyl <i>Tawa</i>
is a basal coelophysoid. In this case, Avepoda contains <i>Tawa</i>
and other coelophysoids under ACCTRAN character optimization, but
excludes Coelophysoidea under DELTRAN optimization.  Note it is
not the same as Avipoda Novas, 1992, which was proposed for a clade
similar in extent to Tetanurae.<br>
Paleotheropoda was proposed as a paraphyletic order of theropods by
Paul (1988), including all theropods which were not avetheropods. This
consisted of what are generally recognized today as coelophysoids,
ceratosaurs, megalosauroids and sinraptorids. No other reference used
the term due to the general dislike of paraphyletic groups, and in 2002
Paul referred to the same grade as baso-avepods. As Paul's (1988)
Theropoda was equivalent to Avepoda, Paleotheropoda is catalogued here
as a synonym of that group.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Neotheropoda was named by Bakker (1986) in a figure
for a clade containing ceratosaurs and tetanurines (his Dinoaves), but
excluding coelophysids (his podokesaurs). In 1988, Bakker et al. used
the name in the same manner. It was generally ignored for the following
decade, as most workers followed Gauthier's phylogeny which placed
coelophysids in Ceratosauria instead of basal to it. Sereno (1995)
revived the name in an abstract for a clade containing ceratosaurs
(including coelophysoids) and tetanurines but not <i>Eoraptor</i> or <i>Herrerasaurus</i>,
making his concept different than Bakker's. Sereno later (1998) gave
the first phylogenetic definition for the clade- "<i>Coelophysis</i>,
Neornithes, their most recent common ancestor and all descendants."
Wilson et al. (2003) specified <i>Coelophysis bauri</i>, while Sereno
(2004) specified <i>Passer domesticus</i>. Padian et al. (1999) used a
different definition- "The most recent common ancestor uniting
Neornithes and <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, and all descendants of that common
ancestor." I've modified it by using <i>Ceratosaurus nasicornis</i>
and <i>Passer domesticus</i> as the internal specifiers. Kischlat
(2000) used a similar definition, but substituted <i>Allosaurus</i>
for Neornithes since his Theropoda is based on <i>Allosaurus</i> (I
modify his definition by using type species <i>C. nasicornis</i> and <i>A.
fragilis</i>). 
However, Sereno's definition using coelophysoids has become the
consensus, making the clade fundamentally different than Bakker's
original now that ceratosaurs are viewed as closer to tetanurines than
to coelophysoids.<br>

Holtz (1992) first used Eutheropoda in his thesis for a clade
containing all theropods except <i>Procompsognathus</i>, consisting of
Ceratosauria sensu lato and Tetanurae. Listed diagnostic features are
cervical pleurocoels and a transversely narrow pubis. Subsequent
studies have shown <i>Procompsognathus</i> has cervical pleurocoels
and narrow pubis and is probably a coelophysoid. Eutheropoda was later
published in an abstract for "("Ceratosauria" + Tetanurae)" by Novas et
al. (2003), again using a broader version of Ceratosauria which
includes coelophysoids. <br>

Rowe and Gauthier's (1990) definition for Ceratosauria includes every
taxon they recognized as a ceratosaur, which makes it problematic now
that the group is often viewed as paraphyletic to varying degrees. As
coelophysids are usually seen as outside the <i>Ceratosaurus</i>+<i>Passer</i>
clade now, this definition would make all avepods ceratosaurs. If <i>Liliensternus</i>
is outside the <i>Coelophysis</i>+<i>Passer</i> clade (as in
Bittencourt Rogriguez, 2010), this version of Ceratosauria would be
slightly more inclusive than Neotheropoda.<br>

(at least 18 individuals including juveniles, subadults and adults)
over 3000 bones and fragments including associated skulls and skeletons

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Britt et al., 2010) quadratojugal fused to
quadrate; splint-like metatarsals II and IV.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Britt et al. (2010) initially announced this as three bonebeds
containing two taxa based on the preservation of both narrow and
distally expanded scapulae. They noted a small taxon based on BYU
19002, which has splint-like metatarsals II and IV, and a fused pelvis
and tibiotarsus suggesting adult age. They also noted a larger taxon
represented by multiple individuals and hundreds of elements, with
possibly procumbant dentary teeth, quadratojugal fused to the quadrate,
and cervical ribs as long as five vertebrae. Later, Britt et al. (2011)
reported only one taxon represented by two bonebeds of nineteen
individuals. As they described all ages as being present and metatarsal
II as splint-like, it seems small specimens like BYU 19002 have been
reinterpreted as juveniles and the scapular variation as individual or
ontogenetic.  Intriguingly, the metatarsal and dentary characters
are
like noasaurids, the fused quadrate and quadratojugal is like
abelisaurids, and some ceratosaurs like elaphrosaurines can be similar
to coelophysoids.  Further judgement awaits its eventual
description.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
One of two specimens discovered in 1996 at the Dinosaur Ridge locality
and assigned by Hunt (1998) to Theropoda, he notes "The larger species
is only known at present from a proximal tibia that represents an
animal comparable in size to the specimen described from Norian strata
in PEFO by Padian (1986)."  Nesbitt et al. (2007) stated "The
proximal
portion of the tibia bears a cnemial crest and two divided posterior
condyles. These features are not diagnostic to Theropoda; thus, this
specimen cannot be assigned to the Theropoda" and so only assigned it
to Archosauria indet..  While Hunt and Wright list it as in the
MDM
coll. and Nesbitt et al. as NMMNH unnumbered, Marsh and Parker (2020)
reveal it eventually became PEFO 43909.  Marsh and Parker assigned
it
to Neotheropoda after all based on the concave surface
between posterior condyles and cnemial crest and the fibular crest.<br>
In 1998 the Dinosaur Wash part of the Dying Grounds locality was
discovered, and Hunt and Wright (1999) state it "yields diverse small
reptile specimens including abundant postcrania and teeth of a small
theropod" depopsited at the MDM.  Therrien and Fastovsky (2000)
state "The theropod remains consist of vertebrae, teeth, and skull
fragments belonging to an undetermined theropod."  <br>
Polcyn et al. (2002)
state "ceratosaur vertebral elements and teeth that are probably
referrable to the Coelophysidae" are present at SMU microvertebrate
locality 252, listed as ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
sp. in their faunal table.  Parker (2005) says "obviously these
may also belong to poposaurids as admitted by these workers", but
Polcyn et al. only said this about different "small, laterally
compressed teeth [that] may be referable to either theropods or
poposaurs."  Parker similarly misrepresented the paper when he
claimed "these authors note that several jaw fragments with teeth may
actually pertain to coelophysoids", when Polcyn et al. actually wrote
"numerous isolated teeth and tooth-bearing jaw fragments have been
recovered and are referable to sphenodontids, lepidosauromorphs, and
theropod and ornithischian dinosaurs" without explicitly saying any of
the jaw fragments were theropod.  In any case the material remains
undescribed, and while isolated teeth are usually best referred to
Archosauria indet., vertebrae could be more diagnostic if they are more
than dorsal or caudal centra.<br>

by Parker and Irmis (2005) to "possess a sloping posterior margin
adjacent to the greater trochanter and therefore [is] probably
referable to the Theropoda."  All of the PEFO specimens were
assigned to Neotheropoda by Marsh and Parker (2020)
based on "An enlarged anteromedial tuber and corresponding ligament
sulcus" or "the presence of the fibular crest and a concave proximal
surface between the cnemial crest and posterior condyles."<br>
Discovered in 1934, Irmis (2005) stated UCMP 25820 is "assignable to
the
Saurischia because it has a well-developed posterolateral process, is
quadrangular in distal view, and has a concave posterolateral margin in
distal view."  Nesbitt et al. (2007) instead stated the presence
of  "a
well-developed descending posterolateral process, a concave
posterolateral margin in distal view and a well developed dorsal
excavation for insertion of the ascending process of the astragalus,"
... "in combination with a posterolateral process that extends well
beyond the body of the tibia laterally, allow us to refer this specimen
to Theropoda indet."  They state it may be referrable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>, which should be
determinable based on the tibial autapomorphies of that genus.<br>

?(MDM coll.) vertebrae and/or limb fragments (Hunt and Wright, 1999)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Hunt et al. (1996)
first mention "undescribed specimens of a smaller theropod dinosaur"
and "specimens (vertebrae, femur) of a ceratosaurian distinctly smaller
than the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>" partial
skeleton."  Hunt (1998) wrote "Our collecting has yielded
specimens of a third, smaller, ?ceratosaurian dinosaur including a
complete femur and numerous vertebra" from the Dinosaur Hill locality",
while Hunt et al. (1998) stated "Several other theropod specimens
(femur, vertebrae) have recently been collected by APH from this
locality (uncatalogued PEFO specimens)."  These would have been
collected in 1996 as part of The Dawn of the Dinosaurs Project and used
Hunt's sensu lato concept of Ceratosauria that includes
coelophysoid-grade taxa, but have yet to be described.<br>
Hunt and Wright
(1999) mentioned "a hollow, theropod limb shaft from Flattops"
collected in 1998 by the MDM in the 'Painted Desert' (= Petrified
Forest) Member.  This locality might be Flattops NW (PFV 070) or
Flattops W (PFV 071) (but is not Flattops NE PFV 354 because that is in
the Sonsela Member), and the specimen is possibly Archosauria indet. in
any case if even the identity of the limb bone can't be
determined.  They also say "The second most common dinosaur[in the
Petrified Forest Member] is a small theropod that is represented at
most localities by vertebrae and limb fragments", and their Table 1
lists MDM material found in 1998 at Zuni Well Mound and RAP Hill, as
well as MDM material found in 1999 at RAP Hill North and RAP Hill
West.  Marsh and Parker (2020) describe a proximal femur (PEFO
34863) and metatarsal I (PEFO 36741) from Zuni Well Mound which they
refer to Dinosauria and Ornithodira respectively, which may be some of
the supposed theropod limb fragments from that locality.  <br>
PEFO 33984 was stated by Parker and Irmis (2005) to "possess a sloping
posterior margin adjacent to the greater trochanter and therefore [is]
probably referable to the Theropoda."  All of the PEFO specimens
were
assigned to Neotheropoda by Marsh and Parker (2020)
based on "An enlarged anteromedial tuber and corresponding ligament
sulcus" or "the presence of the fibular crest and a concave proximal
surface between the cnemial crest and posterior condyles."<br>

Tykoski (1998) noted "The femur has a low, conical anterior trochanter"
and "The bone texture is rough and pitted in the place a trochanteric
shelf develops in robust adults", and concluded that while the locality
matches <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span> the
specimens "could just as conceivably be those of a very young <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus wetherilli</span>."  He
stated "they should be assigned to Ceratosauria <span style="font-style: italic;">indet</span>.", which is equivalent to
Neotheropoda here.<br>
Gay (2001) described a specimen found in 1978, which he identified as
"a distal humerus, a partial distal fibula and a tooth fragment" of an
infant <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>. 
He
claimed "The humerus very closely resembles that of UCMP 37302, with
the ectocondyle, ectepicondyle, entocondyle and entepicondyle all being
present in the same arrangement ... but much more pronounced", the
fibula has "the same general shape and curvature found in both MNA PI.
530 and MNA Pl.539", and "The tooth may or may not belong to this
animal."  However, Marsh and Rowe (2020) reidentified this
specimen as
"the distal end of a coelophysoid pubis", where the supposed humeral
and fibular pieces are
parts of a pubis (Marsh, pers. comm. 8-9-21) while the tooth may be
incorrectly assigned.<br>

(AMNH 2705) in February 1881 "at three localities, one described as
"Gallina Canyon", the other two as "Arroyo Seco"" (Sullivan et al.,
1996).  The latter reference further states that "It is not
certain from exactly which of the three localities BALDWIN collected a
given syntype or original referred specimen; the precise association
was lost long ago."  Thus "Arroyo Seco" as used on this site
refers to any of those three localities.  After preliminary
descriptions by Cope (1887a, b), Huene (1906, 1915) described and
illustrated most material, and Padian (1986) provided the definitive
historical review of the specimens.  Padian also first articulated
the issue that the Arroyo Seco elements were less diagnostic than
associated skeletons like UCMP 129618 found in 1982 or the numerous <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry (= Ghost Ranch, = Whitaker Quarry) skeletons found in
1947.  Hunt and Lucas (1991) attempted to solve this by naming the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> Quarry specimens <span style="font-style: italic;">Rioarribasaurus colberti</span>, but the
ICZN (1996) ruled that a <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry specimen (AMNH 7224) is the neotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>, leaving the
Arroyo Seco specimens as not definitely <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>.  Sullivan and
Lucas (1999) erected a new species of supposed ceratosaur sensu lato
from near Arroyo Seco, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis
baldwini</span>,
and believed Baldwin's Arroyo Seco material may belong to it,
but stated "most of these specimens are not diagnostic because they
lack
apomorphic characters that would permit unambiguous generic and
specific assignment."  While Sullivan and Lucas referred Baldwin's
AMNH 2706 pubis to the taxon and Heckert et al. (2000) proposed the
Snyder Quarry coelophysid was <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis</span>,
Nesbitt et al. (2005, 2007) and Ezcurra (2006) later demonstrated <i>Eucoelophysis</i>
was not a theropod but instead a silesaur and that these referred
materials are coelophysoid-grade theropods. Nesbitt et al. (2007)
reexamined the Arroyo Seco specimens and found that the cervical
vertebrae (AMNH 2717, 2720), sacrum (AMNH 2722) and pelvic elements
(AMNH 2705, 2706, 2708, 2722) could be referred to coelophysoid-grade
theropods based on- dual pairs of cervical pleurocoels, pubic obturator
foramen, well developed supraacetabular crest that arcs ventrally at
its lateral margin; a squared-off distal portion of the postacetabular
process; a deep brevis fossa where the lateral ridge originates near
the supraacetabular crest; flattened dorsal margin of the iliac blade;
fully perforated acetabulum. It's probable only one species of
coelophysid is represented, possibly congeneric or conspecific with <i>C.
bauri</i>. The dorsal vertebrae and most of the limb elements were
supposedly undiagnostic within Archosauria, femur AMNH 2704 is a
silesaur (this site), distal femur AMNH 2721 is <i>Dromomeron romeri</i>
(Nesbitt et al., 2009), and distal femur AMNH 2725 is a shuvosaurid
(Nesbitt et al., 2007).  The remaining material is listed here for
convenience pending restudy.<br>
Williston and Case (1912) reported "bone fragments referred
provisionally to the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>"
were found in the "immediate locality" of the type material. 
Colbert (1989) stated "In the summer of 1986, some fragmentary <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
bones were found at Ghost Ranch, somewhat to the east of Arroyo Seco
and downstream from the Ghost Ranch Quarry.  This locality is
about a mile to the southeast of the quarry."  Sullivan (1994)
reported "indeterminate ceratosaur fossils which are considered
topotypic material of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>"
found in 1993 from five sites around Arroyo Seco.  Sullivan et al.
(1996) published the specimens and localities, again proposing them as
topotypes for <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>. 
These are undescribed with only SMP VP-487 figured, and are probably
indeterminate at levels between Coelophysidae and Archosauromorpha.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Canjilon material</span>- Long and
Murry (1995) stated "A complete dorsal vertebra (UCMP V2816)
was found among the numerous <span style="font-style: italic;">Typothorax</span>
and pseudopalatine phytosaur
remains at the Canjilon Quarry", and "Though this vertebra is
comparable to those of AMNH 7224 in size and detail, we believe this
slightly older theropod specimen cannot be determined to genus and
refer it to Theropoda incertae sedis." Note V2816 is the locality
number for Canjilon Quarry, not a specimen number.  Based on this
reported resemblence to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>,
this is placed in Neotheropoda here instead of Saurischia because
herrerasaurids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chindesaurus</span>
have much shorter dorsal centra although they were classified as
theropods by Long and Murry.  Angielczyk (2002) reports "This
specimen could not be found."<br>
Discovered on October 13 1928, UCMP 152645 was first published by
Nesbitt and Stocker (2008) who briefly describe and figure the unfused
proximal tarsus.  They conclude "The combination of the character
states (perforated acetabulum, box-like calcaneum, and
anteroposteriorly compressed ascending process of the astragalus)
confirm that UCMP 152645 represents a theropod."  Within that
clade, it seems to be basal as "The ascending process has an
anteroposterior thickness more similar to those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
(AMNH FR 30576), the 'Padian theropod' (UCMP 129618; Padian, 1986) and
GR 211 [the Hayden Quarry coelophysid], than to the much more
anteroposteriorly thin process of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>."<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Chatterjee (1993)
stated as correspondence at the end of his <i>Shuvosaurus</i>
description "we have just found a diagnostic leg bone (tibia) from the
Post Quarry which confirms the presence of an ostrich dinosaur", though
this was not technically referred to the genus. The tibia was later
assigned the number TTU-P11044, as revealed in Lehane's (2005) thesis,
who suggested it was too small to belong to <i>Shuvosaurus</i>
individuals known from that quarry. He assigned it to Theropoda indet.,
as did Nesbitt and Chatterjee (2008) who described it as Theropoda
indet., and said it
is "identical to the Snyder Quarry coelophysoid (NMMNH P-29046, NMMNH
P-29047, and NMMNH P-31293; Nesbitt et al. 2007) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
(AMNH 7223; AMNH 7224) tibiae."  Marsh et al. (2019)
suggested it may belong to the<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Chindesaurus</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span>
"clade owing to the presence of two notches on the posterior margin of
the proximal end", but the second concavity is far medial of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chindesaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span>,
and the tibia otherwise differs in the long cnemial crest, fibular
crest, anteriorly shifted lateral condyle, and concave posterolateral
edge in distal view, which are all more similar to neotheropods (Martz
et al., 2012).  Contra Nesbitt and Chatterjee, it is not identical
to the Snyder Quarry theropod or <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>,
being most similar to Upper Cooper Canyon tibia TTU-P10534 in having an
anteroposteriorly deep distal end (97% of width), short posterolateral
process, anteriorly placed lateral condyle and no medial
malleolus.  It differs from that tibia in being even deeper
anteroposteriorly and having a convex anteromedial edge (both in distal
view).<br>
Lehane (2005) referred incomplete ilium TTU-P10071 to <i>Shuvosaurus</i>
in his thesis, but it was identified as <i>Coelophysis</i>
by Lehman and Chatterjee (2005) and agreed to be theropod by later
authors (Nesbitt and Chatterjee, 2008; Martz et al., 2012). While Martz
et al. only identify it to the level of Neotheropoda, it is probably a
coelophysid based on the striaght dorsal edge.<br>
UCMP 65737 was collected on June 15 1963, while UCMP 65773-65775 were
collected on June 22 1963.  These were all referred to ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> on the UCMP online
catalogue, but could easily be from e.g. shuvosaurids pending further
information.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was discovered
between 2001 and 2002. Cunningham et al. (2002) identified TTU-P10534
as "An isolated tibia is referred to a large ornithischian dinosaur",
but Nesbitt et al. (2007) noted it has theropod synapomorphies like a
fibular crest, and shares a subrectangular distal outline with a small
posterolateral process with basal neotheropods.  While it is
listed as unnumbered in Nesbitt et al.'s paper, the number is listed in
Nesbitt and Chatterjee (2008).  It was assigned to Neotheropoda by
Sarigul (2017) and stated to closely resemble <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
in "the robust and poorly flared cnemial crest, slightly elevated
medial border of the proximal surface, relative sizes of tibial
condyles, the triangular fibular crest and the shape of the distal
articular surface."  On the other hand, Nesbitt et al. claimed "it
is indistinguishable from the tibia of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gojirasaurus</span> and the smaller, less
robust, tibiae of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>." 
However, it differs from named basal neotheropods in it
anteroposteriorly deep distal end (87% of width) and short
posterolateral process, while the anteriorly placed lateral condyle is
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Gojirasaurus</span> and the
Snyder Quarry theropod, but like <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
and the Petrified Forest theropod.  It may be close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Lepidus</span>
in the lack of a medial malleolus, as that taxon also seems to have a
short posterolateral process but is unavailable in distal view.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Huene (1921) referred these to <i>Aetosaurus</i>, but
they were reidentified by Walker (1961) as a 'coelurosaur' similar to <i>Procompsognathus</i>.
The quadrate was originally identified as a pubis, the pterygoid as a
postorbital+postfrontal, the mid dorsal as a proximal caudal, the
scapula as an ischium, and the pubis as a scapula. Knoll (2008)
considered most of the material could be aetosaurian or indeterminate,
but thought the scapula might be theropodan though not <i>Procompsognathus</i>.
Huene also describes the pubis SMNS 12596 as <i>Saltoposuchus</i>,
which Walker (1970) referred to a 'coelurosaur' resembling <i>Procompsognathus</i>.
This was figured as a crocodylomorph by Knoll (2008).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) posteroventral medial premaxillary process
(also in coelophysids); narial fossa absent on premaxilla; portion of
maxilla anterior to antorbital fenestra longer than portion under
fenestra (also in <i>Eodromeus</i>); maxilla articulates in slot on
lateral jugal.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martill et al. (2016) listed "large external
naris with slender subnarial bar" in their diagnosis, but as the nasal
is not definitely identified and has no narial border, the naris is of
uncertain size. Furthermore, the slender subnarial process of the
premaxilla is found in most basal saurischians (except <i>Herrerasaurus</i>,
<i>Daemonosaurus</i> and <i>Chilesaurus</i>). Three premaxillary teeth
are unique among the coelophysoids that Martill et al. classified <i>Dracoraptor</i>
as, but shared with <i>Daemonosaurus</i> and <i>Chilesaurus</i>. The
jugal process is no more slender than coelophysids, and not that
different from <i>Daemonosaurus</i>. Almost all basal saurischians
have an anteriorly directed pubis (except some herrerasaurids and <i>Chilesaurus</i>),
and <i>Dracoraptor</i>'s ischium is actually longer compared to its
pubis than coelophysids (~71% vs. 61-~67%) and comparable to e.g. <i>Herrerasaurus</i>
and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. Finally, Martill et al. list "large dorsal
process on distal tarsal IV" but there is no obvious dorsal process.
The tarsal is very close to <i>rhodesiensis</i> in shape except the
posterior third is narrower and it has a slightly concave medial edge.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 2014 and was described
in 2016.<br>
Note the maxillae are in medial view, as the figure caption states, but
contra the text. Contra the text and reconstruction, only the small
anteriormost jugal groove probably articulated with the maxilla. The
longer ridge and groove on the main body is common in early dinosaurs
(e.g. <i>Herrerasaurus</i>) and non-articulating. The supraoccipital
is in anterior (internal) view, not ventral view as stated by the text.
Note the large posttemporal fenestrae as in <i>Silesaurus</i> but
unlike dinosaurs. The cervical is not opisthocoelous, contra the text,
as the anterior central surface is slightly concave. The supposed first
caudal is near certainly a ?last sacral based on the broad transverse
processes originating on the centrum (compare to e.g. <i>Staurikosaurus</i>).
The authors do call it "a partially sacralised element", but any
ambiguity seems unnecessary. The next element could easily be a sacral
too, though its more fragmented condition makes this more uncertain.
I'm doubtful the supposed furcula is correctly identified. One side is
much narrower than the other, and each is curved in a different
direction (thin side concave toward the outside of the angle). Furcular
arms are subequal in width, and those of coelophysoids (e.g. <i>kayentakatae</i>)
are basically circular in section, so that twisting in <i>Dracoraptor</i>
is not an excuse. It's more probably a posterior dorsal rib, which are
also similar in having a ridge along the outside corner. The tuberculum
may be covered in matrix. The authors say "A calcaneum is not present.
Two distal tarsals (dt III &amp; dt IV) and part of a putative third
are present in a row." No archosauriforms actually have three distal
tarsals per pes (certainly no theropods do), so that 'putative third'
is more likely the supposedly missing calcaneum, especially as it's
placed right next to distal tarsal IV (labeled 'Ldtii'). The supposed
"?Metaacarpal of digit I" [sic] is a metacarpal II, very similar to <i>rhodesiensis</i>,
more elongate than metacarpal I and more robust than metacarpal III.
While I haven't identified all of the phalanges in this block, it's
clear Martill et al.'s statement "they are assumed to be from the left
manus as they are associated with the left radius and ulna" is in
error. For instance, the phalanx underlying the proximal radius is too
large to belong to any manual digit and is probably pedal phalanx
III-1, while supposed manual unguals I and III lack flexor tubercles
("I" shows an obvious depression in that area) and at least "III" is
virtually straight. These unguals more nearly match pedal unguals of
e.g. <i>Coelophysis</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i>, while supposed
ungual II is manual due to its curvature and large flexor tubercle.
Among other phalanges, that at the distal end of metacarpal II matches
a manual phalanx II-1, that on the proximal end of metacarpal II
belongs to manual digit III, that between unguals "I" and "II" looks
like its from pedal digit II, and the small one by the anterior end of
the dorsal centrum would be manual IV-1. The latter suggests a less
reduced digit IV than coelophysids or <i>Herrerasaurus</i>. Thus the
manual reconstruction with its short penultimate phalanges and
metacarpal ratios should not be trusted.<br>
Martill et al. (2016) recovered <i>Dracoraptor</i> as a basal
coelophysoid sister to Coelophysidae using a version of Nesbitt et
al.'s basal dinosaur matrix. 15% of their <i>Dracoraptor</i> entries
are miscoded though, and once corrected and placed in an improved
version of that matrix that excludes the highly modified <i>Velociraptor</i>
OTU, it emerges as sister to a <i>Daemonosaurus</i>+<i>Chilesaurus</i>
clade, which is itself sister to Neotheropoda.<br>

<p>Halticosauridae Bock, 1952<br>
Halticosaurinae Bock, 1952 vide Paul, 1988<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Bock (1952) originally named this as a family of
coelurosaurs (sensu Huene) containing <i>Liliensternus</i> (as <i>Halticosaurus
liliensterni</i>). It is often ascribed to Huene (1956). Welles (1984)
included <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Halticosaurus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i>
and <i>Longosaurus</i>, while Chatterjee (1993) and Hu (1993) also
included the first two genera. Paul (1988) used a subfamily
Halticosaurinae to include <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.
The family has never been defined with explicit synapomorphies, instead
being a receptacle for the larger coelophysoids which current analyses
indicate form a grade basal to coelophysids and/or
averostrans/tetanurines. Although <i>Halticosaurus</i> has never been
entered in a data matrix, <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
have never formed a clade exclusive of <i>Coelophysis</i> in any
published study. Thus Halticosauridae has remained unused by most
current workers. If <i>Halticosaurus</i> is shown in the future to
share synapomorphies with <i>Liliensternus</i>, <i>Dilophosaurus</i>,
<i>Sarcosaurus</i> or another taxon outside Coelophysidae,
Halticosauridae should be applied to the resulting clade.<br>

sacral vertebra; more distally placed anterior trochanter; smaller
distal condyles on metatarsal II which extend less far proximally on

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1906. Norman (1990) and
Rauhut and Hungerbuhler (2000) believe <i>Halticosaurus</i> is
indeterminate. However, Welles (1984) finds differences between
comparable taxa such as <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Huene (1908) originally assigned <i>Halticosaurus</i>
only to Dinosauria, then later (1909) to Saurischia. Romer's (1956)
assignment to Hallopodidae is incorrect, as <i>Hallopus</i> is a
crurotarsan differing from <i>Halticosaurus</i> and other theropods in
having a proximally unprojected anterior trochanter among other
characters. Norman (1990) believed the remains could be from a basal
sauropodomorph or a theropod, though the sauropodomorph characters
seems to be untrue (cervical pleurocoels absent; two sacral vertebrae;
similar femur), and the theropod character primitive (elongate
metatarsal). Assignments to Compsognathidae (Zittel, 1911) and
Coeluridae (Huene, 1920) are similarly incorrect, as the low spike-like
anterior trochanter is more primitive than coelurosaurs. Most workers
have assigned <i>Halticosaurus</i> to Podokesauridae (Huene, 1914), an
equivalent Procompsognathidae (Romer, 1966), or its eponymous family
Halticosauridae (Bock, 1952). These categories are equivalent to the
modern concepts of Coelophysoidea, with halticosaurids now thought to
be a basal grade of that clade. Between 1934 and 1984, such statements
were usually based on <i>Liliensternus</i>, then believed to be a
species of <i>Halticosaurus</i>. Rauhut and Hungerbuhler (2000) give
the only modern account of <i>H. longotarsus</i>, noting the material
is very poorly preserved and most is not identifiable as theropod. As
the holotype was found with <i>Sellosaurus gracilis</i> remains, some
may be prosauropod. The proximal femora show a spike-like lesser
trochanter and downturned head, as in coelophysoids. They therefore
think some of the type may be coelophysoid. If this is true, the short
cervical centrum excludes it from Coelophysidae. However, <i>Halticosaurus</i>
has never been included in a phylogenetic analysis or described in
detail since its discovery.<br>

Lower Lias, England</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK 41352) maxillary or dentary fragment, tooth (25
x 10 x ? mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note the name <i>Megalosaurus woodwardi</i> has been
independently created two other times. Once by Huene (1932) as a
(probably accidentally retained) assignment of his new species <i>Magnosaurus
woodwardi</i> (itself an objective junior synonym of <i>Sarcosaurus
adrewsi</i>), and again by Olshevsky (1991) as an unattributed supposed
junior synonym of <i>Walgettosuchus woodwardi</i>. These are all based
on different holotypes, though ironically Lydekker (1909) did consider
the <i>Sarcosaurus andrewsi</i> material to belong to <i>Megalosaurus
woodwardi</i>.<br>
This tooth was first mentioned by Dawkins (in Huxley, 1869) as <i>Megalosaurus</i>.
Purchased by the NHMUK in 1869, Lydekker (1888) described it as <i>Zanclodon</i>(?)
sp. b. as he felt the large degree of labiolingual compression and
longitudinal striations were more similar to that genus than to <i>Megalosaurus</i>.
Lydekker (1909) reviewed Woodward's (1908) paper describing the tibia
that would later be named <i>Sarcosaurus andrewsi</i>, and felt the
tibia and tooth belonged to the same species, which he named <i>Megalosaurus
woodwardi</i>, designating the tooth as the type. Huene (1926) was
apparently unaware of the 1909 paper and named NHMUK 41352 <i>Megalosaurus</i>
(gen. ?) <i>lydekkeri</i>, stating simple curvature distinguished it
from <i>Megalosaurus terquemi</i>. In 1932, Huene reassigned the
species to <i>Magnosaurus</i>, again with reservations, though without
stating his reason. He believed unspecified remains from the Lower Lias
of Watchet referred to <i>Megalosaurus</i> by Phillips might belong to
the same species, but as these have never been described this is
uncertain. NHMUK 41352 has since been called <i>Megalosaurus or
Magnosaurus lydekkeri</i> and is usually placed as Theropoda indet., as
in the most recent reviews by Benson and Barrett (2009) and Carrano et
al. (2012). Carrano et al. considered it likely to be non-tetanurine as
it's striated and "the tooth lacks the specialized features of
tetanurans in which such striations also occur (e.g. spinosaurids)."
But the striations in <i>M. woodwardi</i> are much narrower and less
prominent than the fluting in spinosaurids, and there's no reason they
couldn't evolve in another tetanurine lineage.<br>
Because <i>Megalosaurus woodwardi</i> has priority over <i>Megalosaurus
lydekkeri</i>, but has not been used since it was named, ICZN Article
23.9.1 should be consulted to check if the former is a nomen oblitum.
Usage of <i>Megalosaurus lydekkeri</i> must be maintained if
(23.9.1.1) <i>M. woodwardi</i> has not been used as a valid name after
1899 (false, as Lydekker used it in 1909) and (23.9.1.2) <i>M.
lydekkeri</i> has been used as a valid name "in at least 25 works,
published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 50 years
and encompassing a span of not less than 10 years" (false as far as I
can tell, as an extensive search located only 13-15 works since 1962).
Thus <i>Megalosaurus woodwardi</i> is the valid name, unless a worker
were to petition the ICZN to suppress it. <br>

valid. The angular rostral margin is found in <i>Liliensternus,

interdental plates are found in <i>Plateosaurus, Dilophosaurus</i> and
several other theropods. The third character, "replacement teeth
exposed at base between interdental plates", is correlated with
separate interdental plates. The authors find it agrees quite well with
<i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, but refer it to
Theropoda indet.. Welles (1984) found several differences from <i>Dilophosaurus</i>,
so I think we should wait for an in depth analysis to proclaim this
specimen indeterminate. If added to the matrix of Carrano et al.
(2012), it emerges as a noasaurid, suggesting it may be a basal
ceratosaur, though the authors considered it a non-averostran.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- A chimaerical taxon whose holotype includes portions
of multiple organisms. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in Summer 1983 and initially identified as
"a juvenile specimen referrable to <i>Coelophysis"</i>
(Chatterjee, 1986), the type material was then reported as two
individuals of the oldest bird in the popular press (Wilford, 1986).
Wilford stated Chatterjee "said he was naming the creature <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>,
or first bird", with the avian identification based on both characters
now recognized in even coelophysid theropods (e.g. large orbits,
furcula, sternum, hollow bones) and some generally limited to
coelurosaurian clades (large braincase, teeth limited to anterior jaws,
keeled sternum, ulnar and metacarpal quill knobs).  Beardsley
(1986) reported additional bird-like characters claimed by Chatterjee-
incomplete postorbital bar, "typically avian" quadrate, elongated
forelimbs, "flight muscle attachment sites on the humerus" and
(lateral) cnemial crest.  Chatterjee (1987) reported thirty
cranial characterts shared by <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
and Aves but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>,
and the following year suggested a semilunate carpal articulating with
a single metacarpal also supported this (Chatterjee, 1988).  This
relationship was met with skepticism from the paleontological
community, with Ostrom (1987) questioning its avialan identification,
while Paul (1988) tentatively believed it to be a herrerasaurian. 
This latter idea was based on the combination of primitive characters
(low astragalar ascending process; supposed tetradactyl pes which is
contradicted by the short metatarsal I identified in the holotype) and
bird-like characters of <span style="font-style: italic;">Herrerasaurus</span>
that were not explicitly said to
be shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
(narrow scapula that is more developed in than
<span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>- Elongation Index ~9
vs. 5.8; unspecified pectoral joint
similarity; proximally extensive humeral ectocondyle; acetabular
antitrochanteric surface that was never proposed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>;
opisthopubic pelvis).  Paul also claimed supposed herrerasaur
<span style="font-style: italic;">Alwalkeria</span> "shares some
distinctive features with "Protoavis."", but
the only potential feature mentioned is serrationless teeth which are
part of the crocodylomorph skull in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alwalkeria</span> type, not the
dinosaurian portion.  Given that celophysoids have a narrower
scapula than <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> (EI
7.7) and proximally extensive ectocondyle
(e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">rhodesiensis</span> QG/1;
contra Paul), only the opisthopubic pelvis remains to
connect <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> to
herrerasaurines.  Given the otherwise highly
dissimilar pelvic anatomy it is unlikely the supposed pelvis belongs to
a herrerasaurian.<br>
Chatterjee
(1991) officially named the taxon and described the skull in depth
while figuring some of the type postcrania, then described the type and
Kirkpatrick postcrania (Chatterjee, 1999).  Unfortunately, the
material has a highly fractured surface and was repaired and
reconstructed prior to being figured, with photographs not indicating
clearly which features are real and illustrations being either
simplistic (1991) or idealized schematics (1995-1999).  Notably
the appendicular measurements given in 1999 are based on Chatterjee's
reconstructions that usually involve unknown lengths of missing shaft,
so are not repeated above.  Some authors agreed it
was avialan (Kurochkin, 1992; Peters, 1994; Kurochkin, 1995; Martin,
2004). When analyzed as a bird naively accepting Chatterjee's
interpretations, <i>Protoavis</i> is resolved as- an avialan more
derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
intermediate between <i>Avimimus</i>
and Ornithothoraces (Chatterjee, 1991; Chatterjee, 1998; Dyke and
Thorley, 1998); or an enantiornithine-grade ornithothoracine
(Chatterjee, 1999). Kurochkin (1995) hypothesized it was the basalmost
euornithine.  As detailed on this
site, almost every supposed bird-like character proposed in
Chatterjee's 1991 cranial analysis is also present even in basal
theropods (e.g. crista prootica covers anterior temporal recess; middle
cerebral vein; cerebellar fossa extends to supraoccipital), seemingly
absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
(naris posteriorly placed; reduced dorsal maxilla
process; dorsal quadratojugal process absent; quadratojugal cotyla on
quadrate; pterygoid condyle on qudrate; small olfactory lobes; etc.) or
poorly constructed.  The same cranial characters are largely
repeated
in his 1999 analysis, while any discussion of his postcranial
characters is marred by the questionable identification of elements'
identities or even referral to the same taxon.  Note the
Kirkpatrick quarry and unassigned type element identifications above
listed with question marks are based on Chatterjee's identifications,
so could easily be different elements.<br>
Thus most authors have dismissed an avialan identity (Kurochkin, 1991;
Ostrom, 1991; Wellnhofer, 1992; Chiappe, 1995; Feduccia, 1996; Ostrom,
1996; Sereno, 1997; Hunt et al., 1998; Renesto, 2000; Nesbitt et al.,
2005; Martz et al., 2013). These authors have usually suggested the
remains are chimaerical, including a non-avian coelurosaur braincase
(Witmer, 2001), simiosaur cervicals (Renesto, 2000), possibly
lepidosauromorph humerus (Witmer, 2001), coelophysoid femur and
proximal tarsals (Hutchinson, 2001; Nesbitt et al., 2005), and
non-avian archosaurian pes (Sereno, 1997). Chinle and Dockum simiosaurs
(<span style="font-style: italic;">Ancistrorhynchus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Avicranium</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dolabrosaurus</span>, <i>Drepanosaurus</i>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Skybalonyx</span>,
Harris and Downs, 2002, multiple TTU specimens in Mueller and
Chatterjee in prep. in Martz, 2008, Renesto et al., 2009, Martz et al.,
2012), lepidosauromorphs (<i>Clevosaurus</i>), coelophysoids (<i>Camposaurus,
Coelophysis</i>, "Comanchesaurus", <i>Gojirasaurus</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lepidus</span>)
and crurotarsans (phytosaurs, revueltosaurs, aetosaurs, poposauroids,
teratosaurids, crocodylomorphs) are known, but if some elements are
coelurosaurian, it would be unprecedented.  Witmer (2001) has
undertaken the most detailed independant analysis of the remains, and
concludes many of the morphologies identified by Chatterjee (e.g.
pterygoid cotyla on quadrate; mandibular condyles on quadrate; quadrate
foramina; quadratojugal cotyle on quadrate; basisphenoid; scapulae;
clavicle; coracoidal sulci on sternum; intermuscular line on sternum;
ulnar quill knobs; metacarpal quill knobs; opisthopuby; fused ilium and
ischium; ischial antitrochanter; tibiotarsal fusion) cannot be
confirmed. However, he notes several characters are birdlike-
apparently absent contact between squamosal and quadratojugal and
postorbital; heterocoelous cervical vertebrae; well developed cervical
hypapophyses; large cervical neural canals; coracoid morphology
(elongated; strut-like; procoracoid and acrocoracoid processes). 
The inability to trust Chatterjee's identifications has led to the
remains being basically ignored over the last decade.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A coelurosaur braincase?</span>
Witmer (2001) described the large floccular fossa, cranial pneumatic
recesses and metotic strut as coelurosaurian characters in the holotype
braincase. However, the metotic strut is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span> and other
taxa closer to averostrans than
coelophysoids, and comparing <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
to <i>"Megapnosaurus" kayentakatae</i>
suggests it's possible the supposed anterior opening of the posterior
tympanic recess is the actual vagus nerve, while the supposed vagus
foramen could be the larger of two hypoglossal (XII) foramina giving it
the coelophysoid condition.  Anterior temporal recesses go back at
least to basal dinosauromorphs, dorsal tympanic recesses are present in
coelophysoids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Megapnosaurus" kayentakatae</span>) and
the
latter species even shows a posterior tympanic recess albeit with a
smaller and more dorsally located opening than <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>.  The
floccular fossa is no larger than recently figured in <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span> or
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>.  Thus the
supposed coelurosaurian characters have
been discovered to have a much broader distribution, and even if the
cranial foramina of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
were correctly identified they could work
for e.g. a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Gojirasaurus</span>
if the taxon is close to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Simiosaur cervicals?</span>
Renesto (2000) noted some <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
cervical vertebrae share several
characters with <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalancosaurus</span>-
"the same general outline", "the
prezygapophyses have a convex surface and are vertically oriented",
"The presence of "hypapophyses" and of elongate, narrow centra that are
concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly, together with low neural
spines."  Indeed, the hypapophyses of both forms an
elongate keel, the posterior central surface is dorsally angled, the
neural spine is anteriorly limited, and three dimensionally preserved
simiosaur cervical AUP 11362 (Renesto and Fraser, 2003) shows that like
<span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> the central
articulations are actually heterocoelous. 
Note this only applies to what Chatterjee describes as cervicals 2-5,
as the cervicals described as 10-12 are more generalized amphicoelous
archosauromorph in structure.  Renesto also suggested cranial
similarities, the skulls of both being "narrow and pointed anteriorly
with an inflated ... postorbital region", "with a ventrally bent
anterior portion" of the mandible.  However, the supposed dentary
fragments of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> are
ambiguous and too fragmentary to determine
curvature, and the general triangular shape is common in amniotes and
not even that developed in the rounded premaxilla assigned to the
<span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> holotype. 
However, the L-shaped frontals with narrow
interorbital space and highly offset postorbital processes, broad
parietals and anteriorly projecting spurs ("zygomatic process" of
Chatterjee) are similar and suggest the holotype skull roof is also
simiosaurian.  Of Chinle and Dockum simiosaurs, only <span style="font-style: italic;">Avicranium</span>
and isolated elements MNA.V.3652 preserve cranial or cervical
material.  Despite some general similarity to <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> material
in having a triangular skull with large orbits, expanded endocranium,
toothless maxilla and elongate retroarticular process, <span style="font-style: italic;">Avicranium</span>
strongly differs from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
skull roof in having anteriorly
broad frontals, ventrally extensive squamosal and dorsally broad
quadrate.  Although the cervicals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avicranium</span>
are not described
or figured well, the neural spines are tall unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>, while
isolated Chinle cervical centrum MNA.V.3652 is truly procoelous with a
tall anterior surface and ventrally angled posterior surface.  As
more basal <span style="font-style: italic;">Vallesaurus</span> also
has anteriorly broad frontals, this may
indicate the <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span> skull
roof is most closely related to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Megalancosaurus</span> among
simiosaurs.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lepidosauromorph humerus?</span>
Witmer (2001) stated "Although the distal humeral condyles indeed are
well developed, the humerus compares tolerably well with that of extant
squamates, and a lepidosauromorph identification is worthy of
consideration."  Compared to the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Clevosaurus</span>,
the deltopectoral crest is developed more distally and laterally, the
ectocondyle exists and is especially exposed posteriorly, and
entepicondylar and ectepicondylar foramina are absent.  These same
differences exist with the Middle Triassic <span style="font-style: italic;">Fraxinasaura</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Megachirella</span> and the Early Jurassic
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gephyrosaurus</span>, suggesting the
paratype humerus is not lepidosauromorph.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coelophysoid hindlimbs?</span>
Hutchinson (2001) stated "Chatterjee (1997, 1998) reconstructed the
femur of 'Protoavis' with a medially offset femoral head. I have
examined TTUP 9200; it appears to be the femur of a small (possibly
juvenile) basal theropod. The middle of the femoral shaft is missing
and thus the femoral head orientation is not certain. 
However, the preserved femur is identical to coelophysoid femora ...,
and there is no independent evidence that the femoral head was
oriented other than craniomedially as in other basal
theropods."  Nesbitt et al. (2007) in turn wrote it "exhibits the
following dinosaur and theropod characters: offset femoral head,
ligament sulcus, strongly developed facies articularis
antitrochanterica of the femur (from Langer 2004), anterior trochanter
with strong trochanteric shelf and a small posterior trochanter. 
Notably the posterolateral lip on the greater trochanter ("posterior
trochanter") and obturator ridge are similar to coelophysoids like
<span style="font-style: italic;">"Megapnosaurus" kayentakatae</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis rhodesiensis</span>,
but not
herrerasaurids or <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>,
and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chindesaurus</span>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span> clade lacks
a prominent ligament sulcus.  Thus the proximal femur is likely to
be coelophysoid, and as the proximolateral lip, obturator ridge and
trochanteric shelf are only present in robust individuals, this may
represent a new tiny taxon instead of a juvenile.  <br>
Witmer (2001) wrote the paratype proximal tarsals "clearly derive from
a small dinosaur and probably can be assigned to Theropoda, but they
show no real avian or even coelurosaur apomorphies. The ascending
process of the astragalus is very low. The calcaneus is quite large and
shares with the astragalus a very large fibular articular surface" and
that he "can see no evidence of the fusion noted by Chatterjee." 
Nesbitt et al. (2007) further noted the tibial facet is limited to the
astragalus (incorrectly described, but correctly referenced to Rauhut's
2003 character 219) and "the astragalus and calcaneum articulated
directly distal to the tibia and fibula", both of which are unlike
averostrans.  The lack of even a rudimentary calcanear tuber is
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Herrerasaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eodromaeus</span>, while the
non-gluteaform
shape is unlike the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chindesaurus</span>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span> clade.  <br>
Additional <i>Coelophysis</i>-like
material is known from the Cooper Canyon Formation (ilium TTU-P10071,
tibiae TTU-P11044, TTU-P14786 and TTU-P10534), which may belong to the
same taxon<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other material</span>- Many elements
of <i>Protoavis</i>
appear to be from a new supposed pterosauromorph named and described in
a thesis (Atanassov, 2001, 2002), "Procoelous vertebrate taxon A" of
Martz et al. (2012). The holotype (Chatterjee, 1991; reidentified as a
vomer and pterygoid in 1999) sternum is an ischium, the paratype radius
and ulna are the tibia and fibula respectively, and the paratype
metacarpus is the metatarsus.  The latter was foreseen by Sereno
(1997), who wrote "The four-digit manus (Chatterjee 1995), for example,
is more appropriately identified as an archosaurian pes."  The new
form's maxilla, dentary, ilium and femur seem unrepresented in <i>Protoavis</i>'
material, while some characters of the vertebrae are a good match.
Unfortunately, only two vertebrae (both sacrals) were associated with
the appendicular and cranial elements of this new taxon, so it's
possible the latter's referred vertebrae are from a tanystropheid,
simiosaur or other taxon.<br>
The articulated series of paratype posterior cervicals is not similar
to simiosaurs and instead resembles basal archosauromorphs in being
amphicoelous with offset centrum faces while lacking laminae often
present in e.g. dinosaurs and other archosaurian subgroups.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Kirkpatrick material</span>-
Chatterjee (1991) notes "A few disarticulated bird bones were found on
Collier's ranch", stating that "A beautiful humerus from this quarry
shows all the avian hallmarks. So far, only vertebrae, coracoid and
limb elements of birds have been recovered from this site, and the
affinity of this material will be discussed in a separate paper." 
He later (1995) states "thirty disarticulated postcranial elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
were recovered from a small mound in the Kirkpatrick quarry", and
similarly in 1997 "I collected a total of thirty-one isolated
postcranial elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
from the Kirkpatrick quarry."  Both works include composites using
elements from both quarries, notably the large-keeled supposed sternum,
although no specimen numbers are mentioned or other elements purely
based on Kirkpatrick material.  His 1998 paper figures the
supposed sternum TTU-P9361, humeri TTU-P9362 (the one mentioned in
1991) and TTU-P9363, although it does not mention the Kirkpatrick
quarry or specimens in the text.  Chatterjee (1999) figures much
of the material, but mostly as idealized reconstructions, with only the
sternum and humeri from the 1998 paper, supposed radius TTU-P9368 and
distal femur TTU-P9370 photographed.  The proximal humerus
TTU-P9365 is mislabeled TTU-P9364 in Chatterjee's figure 14e-f. 
Incomplete humerus TTU-P9362 shows the same distal morphology as the
paratype with some proportional differences (more flared, entocondyle
larger anteriorly and more transversely expanded posteriorly),
suggesting it is a related taxon to whatever the poaratype humerus
belongs to.  Notably, the proximal ulna TTU-P9369 does not
resemble the paratype's proximal 'ulna' in having a projected olecranon
and expanded shaft, and the possible radius TTU-P9368 is much more
slender than the paratype's proximal 'radius', so these elements don't
seem to belong to the pterosauromorph tibia and fibula and may be an
actual ulna and radius.  The ulna strongly resembles <span style="font-style: italic;">Clevosaurus</span>
AUP 11178 in general shape in side view, so may be referrable to that
taxon.  Elzanowski (2008) stated "the Triassic Tecovas formation
femoral fragments which were assigned by Chatterjee (1991) to <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>, but are better
comparable to lizards than to either <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoavis</span>
holotype or any birds" are unlike non-bird theropods in lacking an
ectocondylar tuber.  This refers to the Kirkpatrick femora, and
indeed TTU-P9370 differs from the holotype in lacking an ectepicondylar
tuber so is from a different taxon.  Note the tuber in the
holotype does not necessarily indicate it is from a theropod, as they
are found in other taxa such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Fruitadens</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromomeron</span> as well.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Note the species was originally spelled <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes </span><span style="font-style: italic;">gürichi</span>
by Huene, but this is considered an incorrect original spelling that
must be corrected by ICZN Article 32.5.2.1 ("In the case of a diacritic
or other mark, the mark concerned is deleted, except that in a name
published before 1985 and based upon a German word, the umlaut sign is
deleted from a vowel and the letter "e" is to be inserted after that
vowel") to result in <span style="font-style: italic;">V. guerichi</span>
instead.<br>
Huene (1932) referred this to Podokesauridae as the "size and
structure" fit that family best, and when describing <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
stated (translated) "Due to the age difference and the different
curvature, the species is certainly different, but it is possible that
the genus is the same" (Huene, 1934).  Welles (1984) agreed
regarding the potential synonymy but believed "Our knowledge of
theropod fibulae is so limited that we cannot identify this fibula, and
must consider <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes gurichi</span>
a nomen vanum."  Norman (1990) similarly stated "The material is
indeterminate" at the level of Theropoda and even identified the
element as the "Broken proximal end of a tibia (?fibula)", and Rauhut
and Hungerbuhler (2000) concurred "even its identification as a fibula
may be doubted" and gave it the ridiculously broad status of
"Vertebrata, nomen dubium."  Czepiński et al. (2014) reported in
an abstract that Huene was basically right all along, identifying it as
the proximal fibula of a "probable non-tetanuran neotheropod." 
This was elaborated on in the publication of Skawiński et al. (2017)
that redescribed the taxon in depth and provided detailed comparisons
which distinguished it from most saurischians except non-averostran
neotheropods.  Of the latter, they reported "<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> is very similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes</span>
in all aspects (Welles 1984). There are subtle differences in size and
position of M. iliofibularis tubercle, which is positioned slightly
more proximally and smaller (45 mm, i.e. 9% of total length of fibula;
compared with 52 mm in <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes</span>,
i.e. 15-17% of total length of fibula) in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>. Fibulae of <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dracoraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes</span> are virtually
indistinguishable in shape at first glance... However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
lacks well visible M. iliofibularis attachment."  However, the
authors noted that "is possible that one of the most striking features
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes</span>, the prominence
of crest for the insertion of M. iliofibularis, is a result of
intraspecific variation, as it occurs in many archosaurs" and that the
lack of a proximomedial fibular ridge (unlike older coelophysoids) may
be due to being ontogenetically young.  Given this potential
intraspecific variation, Skawiński et al. conclude "probably it is not
possible to identify <span style="font-style: italic;">Velocipes</span>
more precisely than Theropoda indet.", but this should be revised to
Neotheropoda indet. as they do distinguish it from herrerasaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eodromaeus</span>.<br>

<b>History of use and Podokesauroidea</b>- The idea of grouping <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
with coelophysoids has a long history, but prior to 1994 was done under
two older names- Podokesauridae (Russell, 1984; Carroll, 1988) and
Coelophysidae (Paul, 1988; Novas, 1991; Novas, 1992). The clade was
left unnamed by Rowe (1989), where it was first supported
cladistically. Welles (1984) and some other authors had recognized the
relationship between <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i>,
generally placing them both in Halticosauridae, but had only vague
ideas about their relationship with smaller coelophysids. Holtz (1994)
was the first to use the name Coelophysoidea for a <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
+ Coelophysidae clade, which was soon defined to be stem-based (Sereno,
1998) and thus included <i>Coelophysis</i> and any taxa more closely
related to it than to neoceratosaurs. The term has been used in this
way ever since. Madsen and Welles (2000) correctly noted that
Podokesauroidea has priority over Coelophysoidea according to the ICZN,
since it was named fourteen years earlier. Yet all other workers ignore
this, generally because they value Phylocode rules and Podokesauroidea
has not been phylogenetically defined, or they misread the ICZN to
demand family-level eponyms be diagnosable (it actually only says they
must be nomenclaturally valid). Coelophysoidea is used on this website
because of its near-universal usage since 1994.<br>
<b>Is <i>Dilophosaurus</i> a coelophysoid?</b>- An additional
phylogenetic issue is whether <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and related taxa
(e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Cryolophosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dracovenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>; called dilophosaurs
here as they may not be monophyletic) are coelophysoids, or more
closely related to averostrans. Traditional phylogenies placed them in
Coelophysoidea (see above), and this was found in many 2000s analyses
as well (Wilson et al., 2003; Holtz et al., 2004; Tykoski and Rowe,
2004; Tykoski, 2005; Ezcurra and Novas, 2007). Yet a few 2000s analyses
instead recovered <i>Dilophosaurus</i> as more closely related to
averostrans (Rauhut, 2003; Yates, 2005; Smith et al., 2007). 
Rauhut found <i>Dilophosaurus</i> to be equally well supported as a
coelophysoid when <i>Shuvosaurus</i> was (correctly) excluded, Yates
found dilophosaurs were coelophysoids with only one added step, and
Smith et al. found dilophosaurs were coelophysoids with only six added
steps. Similarly, Ezcurra and Novas found equal bootstrap support for
either option. Yet Tykoski (2005) found it took twenty additional steps
to place <i>Dilophosaurus</i> closer to ceratosaurs and tetanurines.
Perhaps importantly, none of the analyses supporting coelophysoid
dilophosaurids have included <i>Cryolophosaurus</i>, <i>Dracovenator</i>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>, whereas Smith
et al. included all three and Yates includes <i>Dracovenator</i>. Also
relevant is that Tykoski found <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
to have been misscored in prior analyses due to a reliance on subadult
specimens.  All more recent analyses recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> closer
to averostrans than <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>,
such as the taxonomically extensive
Wang et al. (2016) which takes eighteen more steps to place
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> in
Coelophysoidea.  Cau's megamatrix has been
published in several analyses, with Dal Sasso et al. (2018) focusing on
basal neotheropods where it takes only two extra steps to place
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> in
Coelophysoidea (as happened using the different taxon
set in Cau, 2018).  Most recent coelophysoid-grade taxa have been
described using versions of Nesbitt's dinosauromorph analysis which
recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> closer
to averostrans and have Ezcurra et al.
(2021) as the most recent incarnation incorporating the most
taxa.  This topology agrees with Ezcurra's (2012) analysis
"composed of 39 terminals and 633 informative characters" which remains
unpublished, and the results of correcting some scores in this analysis
form the basis of the topology used on this site.  Enforcing
coelophysoid <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
requires only three additional steps. 
Thus the current popularity of non-coelophysoid <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> is not
due to strong character support, and much could probably be revealed by
comparing the strongly supported coelophysoid <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> of Tykoski
(2005) with the opposite in Wang et al. (2016).<br>
<b>Ex-coelophysoids</b>- Several taxa have been included in authors'
equivalents of Coelophysoidea in the past, but do not appear to belong
there. <i>Avipes</i>, <i>Lukousaurus</i>, <i>Saltopus</i> and <i>Velocipes</i>
were all included in Carroll's Podokesauridae, as was common in the
pre-cladistic age. None have ever been placed in Coelophysoidea based
on synapomorphies, the basic rationale being that they were small
Triassic theropods. Current research suggests <i>Saltopus</i> is a
more basal dinosauriform (Benton and Walker, 2010), and <i>Avipes</i>
and <i>Velocipes</i> to be avemetatarsalians of more dubious nature
(Rauhut and Hungerbuhler, 2000). <i>Lukousaurus</i> has not been
recently restudied, but lacks several coelophysoid apomorphies and is
more likely crurotarsan. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>
was assigned to Coelophysoidea (as Coelophysidae) by a couple authors
(Paul, 1988; Novas, 1992) before it was realized to be a ceratosaur
sensu lato (Holtz, 1994), which has been the result of every published
cladistic analysis. Paul (1988) also believed spinosaurids were derived
from coelophysids, but the description of more complete spinosaurid
specimens has led to their classification as tetanurines (Sereno et
al., 1996; Charig and Milner, 1997). Maisch and Matzke (2003)
tentatively assigned tooth GPIT SGP 2001/5 and supposed distal fibula
(actually an ischium?) GPIT SGP 2000/2 from the Qigu Formation of China
to Coelophysoidea, but given their Late Jurassic age and lack of
convincing synapomorphies they are assigned to Averostra here. 
Rauhut (2003) found <i>Shuvosaurus</i> to fall out as a coelophysoid
in his analysis, but the description of <i>Effigia</i> (Nesbitt and
Norell, 2006) led to its recognition as a crurotarsan. Novas et al.
(2009) called femur ISI R283 from the Lower Dharmaram Formation of
India a coelophysoid, but it was later described less specifically as a
non-averostran theropod (Novas et al., 2010). <i>Dracoraptor</i> was
found to be a coelophysoid in its description (Martill et al., 2016),
but this is based on miscodings, and the taxon actually falls out more
basally by <i>Daemonosaurus</i> and <i>Chilesaurus</i>. <br>
<b>Coelophysoidea defined</b>- Sereno's (1998) and Padian et al.'s
(1999) definitions for Coelophysodea are basically equivalent as nearly
every phylogeny agrees <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i> are
more closely related to each other than either is to <i>Coelophysis</i>.
The presence of <i>Passer</i> as a specifier in Sereno's (in press)
redefinition is useful, but <i>Carnotaurus</i> seems superfluous,
since there has never been a (<i>Ceratosaurus</i> (<i>Passer</i> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>,
<i>Coelophysis</i>))) topology suggested. Allain et al. (2012) suggest
only <i>Passer</i> as the external specifier, which leads to
difficulties is coelophysoids are ceratosaurs, as then Coelophysoidea
is a synonym of Ceratosauria instead of a subgroup.<br>

<b>Lectotype</b>- (AMNH 2701) cervical vertebra (63 mm)<br>
<b>Comments-</b> <i>Coelurus longicollis</i> was originally named by
Cope (1887a) based on a cervical vertebra (AMNH 2701), dorsal vertebra
(AMNH 2715), caudal vertebra (AMNH 2702) and femur (AMNH 2704). Cope's
diagnosis consists of characters found in all coelophysoids (cervical
centra with concave anterior articular surface; oblique articular
surfaces on cervical centra; slender mid caudal vertebrae), as well as
the supposed absence of posterior pleurocoels in the cervical (untrue),
and the larger size than <i>C. bauri</i> (possibly ontogenetic or
individual variation). Cope later (1887b) reassigned the species to <i>Tanystropheus</i>
due to the amphicoelous cervicals and referred several more specimens
(AMNH 2703, 2705-2708, 2716, 2735). Huene (1906) further referred a
distal metapodial (AMNH 2730) to the species, and later (1915)
reassigned the material quite extensively. The syntype dorsal (AMNH
2715) was referred to <i>C. bauri</i>, as was the ilium AMNH 2708. The
caudal AMNH 2735 was reassigned to either <i>C. bauri</i> or <i>C.
willistoni</i>, while the supposed tibia or metatarsal AMNH 2721 that
had been referred to <i>C. bauri</i> was now referred to <i>C.
longicollis</i> (it's actually a <i>Dromomeron</i> femur- Nesbitt et
al., 2009). Huene (1915) also referred several additional specimens
(AMNH 2729, 2731, 2739, 2749) to <i>C. longicollis</i>. Though Welles
(1984) intended his <i>Longosaurus longicollis</i> to be based on this
species, he chose a holotype different than the <i>C. longicollis'</i>
lectotype, so the taxa are not objective synonyms. See the discussion
of "unnamed Coelophysidae (Cope, 1887)" above for more details. The
lectotype has an elongate centrum as in coelophysoids.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (UCMP V128659; paratype of <i>Syntarsus kayentakatae</i>)
(juvenile) six proximal caudal centra, three centra, two partial neural
arches, fragmentary ilium, proximal pubes, pubic shaft fragments,
incomplete femora, proximal tibiae, proximal fibula, fragments <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b> (modified from Gay, 2010) short anteriorly projected
pubic peduncle on the ilium (possibly caused by breakage); accessory
medial femoral condyle (possibly the ectocondylar tuber misidentified
due to switching left and right femora); mediodistal femoral crest
longer than half of shaft length (exact position and thus homlogy
uncertain).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Gay lists several characters in the diagnosis
which are meant to distinguish it from other theropods, including <i>kayentakatae</i>.
Gay's description of <i>Kayentavenator</i>'s femoral condyles is
confusing as the "accessory condyle" is said to project from the medial
condyle, yet the only accessory condyle in theropods including birds
(which Gay states the accessory condyle resembles) is the ectocondylar
tuber which is associated with the lateral condyle. Unfortunately, this
supposedly unique morphology is not illustrated, with the femur only
photographed in anterior view. Since the distal femur is separated from
the proximal end in at least one element (and presumably the other, as
the total length of both is said to be difficult to determine), it
seems at least possible Gay confused the right and left distal femora.
This would give them standard theropod ectocondylar tubers instead of
apomorphically lacking the tuber and having a unique medial accessory
condyle. The acetabular shape is described as arching "upward under the
acetabular rim, making it taller than it is wide." However, it is clear
from the illustration and Tykoski's photo that the supracetabular crest
is broken. If it was pendent as in other coelophysoids, the apparent
acetabular depth would decrease. If the below speculation about the
pubic peduncle being broken in Gay's illustration is correct, this
would also add to the acetabulum's length once corrected for. The
greater trochanter and femoral head are stated to be fused, which seems
to be an unorthodox way of saying there is no concavity between them.
Gay notes in the description <i>Coelophysis</i> shares this
morphology, and this is true for all other coelophysoids as well. Gay
describes a mediodistal crest on the femur extending from the medial
condyle for at least half the length of the element. While this might
be assumed to be the medial epicondyle on the anteromedial edge common
in non-tetanurines (but always less than a third of femoral length), <i>kayentakatae</i>
also has a longer (40% of femoral length) crest extending from the
medial condyle on the posterior shaft. Of course if the distal femora
have been switched as proposed above, the crest would become lateral
instead. A posterior lateral crest is present in <i>kayentakatae</i>'s
holotype, but this is intermediate in length between the medial
epicondyle and postromedial crest. These posterior crests are
undeveloped or poorly developed in <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i>,
<i>Coelophysis bauri</i> and <i>Segisaurus</i>, though seem present in
at least some <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>. The distal femur is
photographed in anterior view and shows no evidence of a medial
epicondyle (though the dark coloring in this area could indicate the
bone surface is broken off), while any posterior crest is of course
unobservable. The transverse groove on the proximal femoral head
surface is said to be unique among theropods, but is polymorphic in <i>Coelophysis</i>
(e.g. NMMNH P-29046 and P-54620, UCMP 129618), so could be expected in
some <i>kayentakatae</i> individuals as well. The caudal centra are
said to be highly constricted, with the description further specifying
"minimum width of approximately 4mm, with an articular surface diameter
of 17mm (Figure1)." Based on the scale in that figure, the articular
surface is indeed close to 17 mm, but the minimum central height is 11
mm instead of 4 mm. While <i>kayentakatae</i> caudals have not been
illustrated in lateral view, these proportions are similar to other
coelophysoids like <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i>.
A few additional characters are listed as being specifically distinct
from <i>kayentakatae</i>. The anterior trochanter is said to be placed
more medially, but this is not true. It should be noted that only
robust femora are otherwise known for <i>kayentakatae</i>, which makes
comparison of minor details questionable. The trochanter of <i>Kayentavenator</i>
is actually more laterally placed than gracile individuals of <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
and <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>, but comparable to <i>Liliensternus</i>.
The "groove in ventral surface of femoral head" is presumedly a typo
for the groove in the proximal surface, which is dealt with above. The
"spike on medial surface of tibia" is a typo for the lateral fibular
crest, as indicated by Gay using the same character with 'lateral'
substituted for 'medial' to distinguish <i>Kayentavenator</i> from <i>Coelophysis</i>
and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. The crest of course is not a spike, and is
stated to be large in <i>kayentakatae</i> as well. Thus the supposed
diagnostic characters are all problematic. The accessory femoral
condyle and acetabular shape may be misinterpreted, the distal femoral
crest is unique as described but impossible to homologize, the caudal
proportions and "fused" greater trochanter are normal for
coelophysoids, and the transverse femoral head groove is prone to
individual variation. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- UCMP V128659 was discovered in October 1981 (UCMP
online, contra Rowe, 1989) and referred to <i>Syntarsus kayentakatae</i>
by Rowe (1989), as a subadult gracile individual. Tykoski (1998) did
not examine it for his redescription of the species, but later (2005)
examined it for his PhD thesis and considered it to be "probably
referrable to <i>"Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>" without discussion. Gay
(2010) described the specimen as the new taxon <i>Kayentavenator
elysiae</i>. <br>
<b><i>Kayentavenator</i> a tetanurine?</b> Based on a small
phylogenetic analysis, Gay placed <i>Kayentavenator</i> in Tetanurae
but outside Avetheropoda. This was based on several characters. The
pubic articulation of the ilium is also larger than the ischial
articulation in <i>kayentakatae</i>, and by a larger amount than <i>Kayentavenator</i>.
The pubic peduncle's distal surface is also longer than wide in
ceratosaurs and coelophysids like <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> The
cnemial process arises from the lateral surface of the tibia in almost
all theropods including <i>kayentakatae</i>. The trochanteric shelf is
absent in all gracile and juvenile ceratosaurs and coelophysids, so
cannot be used to place the juvenile <i>Kayentavenator</i> holotype in
Tetanurae. Finally, the anterodistal femoral fossa is said to be
non-elliptical in shape, which refers to a character originally used by
Perez-Moreno et al. (1993). Ironically, in Perez-Moreno et al.'s
analysis, the avetheropods were coded as having an elliptical fossa
unlike Gay's analysis. In truth, avetheropods do not have fossae that
are more or less oval than that of more basal theropods. While the
fossa is poorly developed in <i>Coelophysis</i>, it is illustrated by
Rowe in <i>kayentakatae</i> (as being non-elliptical due to its flat
medial edge, for what it's worth) and is stated to be distinct in <i>Segisaurus</i>
as well. Gay also lists a feature in the description that is supposedly
diagnostic of tetanurines- a pronounced sheet of bone projecting from
the medial surface of the tibia, referring to Naish's (1999)
description of NHMUK R9385. Yet this must be a mistake as the feature
Naish describes is the fibular crest on the lateral surface. However, <i>Segisaurus</i>
has a prominent fibular crest comparable to tetanurines', while <i>kayantakatae</i>'s
is also described as large. There are therefore no characters placing <i>Kayentavenator</i>
in Tetanurae.<br>
<b><i>Kayentavenator</i> not a coelophysid?</b> Gay states <i>Kayentavenator</i>
"lacks a crista tibiofibularis and its associated groove, which are
present in all coelophysoids and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>." Yet
coelophysoids do not have a tibiofibular crest, the structure labeled
as such by Rowe in <span style="font-style: italic;">kayantakatae</span>
being the ectocondylar tuber present in almost all theropods. Young <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> specimens lack the
deep groove lateral to the ectocondylar tuber, so its absence in the
juvenile <i>Kayentavenator</i> specimen (confirmed by Tykoski, 2005)
is expected. <i>Kayentavenator</i> is coded differently than
"Coelophysisidae" [sic] in Gay's matrix for several additional
characters. The caudal vertebrae are coded as having pleurocoels in the
neural arch, which is not possible since pleurocoels are by definition
a feature of vertebral centra. Furthermore, Gay states the position of
the two partial preserved neural arches is impossible to ascertain. The
pneumatic fossae are stated to face anteriorly on each side of the
neural arch, indicating they may be anterior peduncular fossae as in <i>Coelophysis</i>
cervicals, or even anterior infradiapophyseal fossae which all theropod
presacrals possess. Since the neural arches are so fragmentary they
cannot even be placed in the vertebral column (they are assumed by Gay
to be from the posterior region only because the other remains are from
the pelvis and hindlimb), they could even be backwards and merely
exhibit posterior peduncular fossae as in all coelophysid cervicals
including those of <i>kayentakatae</i>. Again, this supposedly unique
feature is not illustrated, making evaluation difficult. The brevis
fossa is coded as being deep unlike coelophysoids, but coelophysoids
including <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> have deep brevis fossae.
Coelophysids are oddly coded as lacking a supracetabular crest, which
is untrue. They are also incorrectly coded as having an acetabular
height only a third or less of the acetabular length, which is not true
of any theropod (e.g. the ratio in <i>kayentakatae</i> is 88%). For
the character "Pubic peduncle of ilium depth: 0, extends ventrally to
the same level as ischiadic peduncle; 1, extends more ventrally than
ischiadic peduncle.", coelophysids are coded as having nonexistant
state 2 unlike <i>Kayentavenator</i>'s state 0. In actuality
coelophysids including <i>kayentakatae</i> have pubic peduncles
extending ventral to their ischial peduncle. This is also true in <i>Kayentavenator</i>
based on the stereophotograph in Tykoski's (2005) thesis, which does
not agree with Gay's drawing. The photo also shows a complete articular
surface on the pubic peduncle, while no obvious anteroventral corner to
the process exists in Gay's illustration. Perhaps the peduncle was
broken off during Gay's examination? The obturator foramen is coded as
open in <i>Kayentavenator</i>, despite Gay illustrating the ventral
edge as closed but broken and stating the ventral margin was missing.
Oddly, <i>Kayentavenator</i> is coded as having a pubic fenestra while
coelophysids are not, despite the fact the latter are the theropods
best known for having pubic fenestrae. Gay codes <i>Kayentavenator</i>
as having a more propubic pelvis (~30 degrees from horizontal) than
coelophysids (~45 degrees). This would be based off the angle of the
pubic peduncle's articular surface, but as noted above, the
preservation of this surface in Gay's illustration is in doubt. The
femoral head is coded as being subequally long and deep (in
anterior/posterior view) while coelophysids' are coded as
proximodistally elongate. However, the transverse width (from medial
edge of femoral head to medial edge of shaft) is only 68% of the
proximodistal height of the head, which is close to that in the <i>kayentakatae</i>
holotype (63%). Since <i>Coelophysis</i> varies between 43 and 62%, a
difference of 5% seems within plausible individual variation in <i>kayentakatae</i>.
The anterior trochanter is aliform (as confirmed by Tykoski, 2005)
while coelophysids' were incorrectly coded as absent. In actuality,
many gracile coelophysoids (e.g. <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Coelophysis
rhodesiensis</i>) have aliform anterior trochanters as well. Gay codes
coelophysids as having an anterior trochanter (contra the previous
character) which does not extend proximally past the femoral head's
ventral margin unlike <i>Kayentavenator</i>, but coelophysids'
anterior trochanters do in fact extend past the femoral head's margin
(e.g. <i>kayentakatae</i>- Rowe, 1989). Finally, the proximomedial
fibular sulcus is coded as absent in coelophysids unlike <i>Kayentavenator</i>,
but this feature is present in all adult coelophysids and was even made
famous by <i>kayentakatae</i>. In all, the characters which supposedly
differ from coelophysids are miscodings or based on questionable
morphologies (perhaps switched distal femora, possibly broken pubic
peduncle, uncertain neural arch position). Supporting the placement of <i>Kayentavenator</i>
in the Coelophysoidea is the presence of a divided articular facet on
the pubic peduncle of the ilium, as illustrated by Tykoski. <br>
<b><i>Kayentavenator</i> an individual of <i>kayentakatae</i>?</b>
Comparing <i>Kayentavenator</i> to other coelophysoids is made
difficult not only by the poor preservation and juvenile status of the
former, but also the wanting description and figures, as well as the
general lack of postcranial characters in coelophysid diagnoses. The
one complete caudal centrum of <i>Kayentavenator</i> lacks a ventral
median groove, unlike at least some of <i>kayantakatae</i>'s centra.
Yet this varies within the tail of many theropods like <i>Eustreptospondylus</i>,
so is probably unimportant. The pubic peduncle being longer than wide
is more similar to <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> than <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
and <i>Liliensternus</i>, as is the narrow and ventrally pointed
ischial peduncle. The femoral head is more elongate than other
coelophysoids (including <i>Halticosaurus</i>- contra Gay), but this
shows individual variation that could be accommodated by <i>kayentakatae</i>
as noted above. If Gay's correct about the anterodistal femoral fossa,
this is like <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>, <i>Segisaurus</i> and <i>kayentakatae</i>
but unlike <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.
The fibular crest is larger in <i>Segisaurus</i> than in <i>Coelophysis</i>,
which is in turn larger than in <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. Based on Gay's
description, <i>Kayentavenator</i> is more similar to coelophysids in
this respect, but without figures it's difficult to determine.
Similarly, any comparisons of vertebral fossae or distal femoral ridges
are hindered by their unknown homology due to a lack of description and
figures. Based on published evidence, <i>Kayentavenator</i> seems to
be a coelophysid. Past that, it's difficult to tell. There's nothing
verified that is more similar to <i>kayentakatae</i> than to other
coelophysids, so I don't think it should be referred to that species.
There are already at least two Kayenta coelophysids after all (<i>kayentakatae</i>
and the Shake-n-Bake taxon which is too small and fused to belong to <i>Kayentavenator</i>).
There are a few supposed diagnostic characters that have escaped
definite rejection (short anteriorly projected pubic peduncle on the
ilium; accessory medial femoral condyle; ambiguous mediodistal femoral
crest longer than half of shaft length), but I'm hesitant to believe
these are real based on the lack of appropriate femur illustrations,
differences from the ilium's photo in Tykoski's thesis, and generally
large amount of errors present in the paper. Further analysis may
vindicate Gay or may identify features shared only with <i>kayentakatae</i>.
At the moment, whether one makes <i>Kayentavenator</i> a nomen dubium
depends on how much one trusts Gay's description. Ezcurra (2012) found <i>Kayentavenator</i>
to be sister to <i>kayentakatae</i> and so suggested their synonymy,
based on a large unpiblished analysis. <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Initially described as a coelurosaur in Warrener's (1983) thesis, this
material was collected between 1951 and 1962.  She felt several
additional elements were possibly referrable (metapodial field number
P65/23, phalanges P65/30 and P65/49 and ungual P65/45), but Spiekman et
al. (2021) said "these elements do not exhibit diagnostic theropod
features" so they are listed as Archosauriformes here.  Fraser and
Padian (1995) mention "associated and articulated material of ... <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span>."  Rauhut and
Hungerbuhler (2000) described the holotype specimens as ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span> sp., and said they "are
extremely similar to the coelophysid <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span>"
and "furthermore very similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Procompsognathus</span>,
and new discoveries might prove that they are referable to this
genus."  Note these authors used field numbers for the specimens
(BMNH
PV RU P 77/1 for the pelvis and articulated vertebrae, BMNH PV RU P
76/1 for the femur), whereas Spiekman et al. reported both are
catalogued as NHMUK PV R 37591.  Galton and Kermack (2010) mention
it
as "vertebrae and the pelvic girdle and hind limb of the coelurosaurian
theropod dinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>." 
Although Keeble et al. (2018) stated "We could not locate these fossils
in the NHMUK collections", Spiekman et al. say "the articulated partial
pelvic girdle and vertebrae, as well as the femur and complete isolated
dorsal vertebra referred to the theropod by Warrener have now been
relocated" and described the specimens in detail as a new taxon of
coelophysoid <span style="font-style: italic;">Pendraig milnerae</span>. 
Spiekman et al. used Ezcurra's version of Nesbitt's dinosauromorph
matrix and recovered it as a non-coelophysid coelophysoid in a polytomy
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Lucianovenator</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Powellvenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span>+Coelophysidae. 
It is placed in
Coelophysoidea here based on the elongate dorsal centra, fused
synsacrum and wider angle between the pubic peduncle
and preacetabular process.<br>

the non-holotype material is considered referred instead of paratype,
"in case that in the future it is shown that they do not belong to the
same species as the holotype."  The material was discovered in the
late 1960s, PVL 4414 "next to the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Riojasuchus</span>"
(Ezcurra, 2017).  For PVL 4414, Ezcurra writes "the size is
congruent for a single neotheropod individual and the character-states
are consistent for a single neotheropod taxon."  PVL 3848 was
originally described by Bonaparte (1971) as Coelurosauria indet., under
the Hueneian concept that included coelophysoids.  Indeeed, he
states Podokesauridae is the "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="" class="">group that best matches the
proportions of the bones described" [translated].  Novas (1989)
later redescribed and </span></span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="" class="">identified
it a</span></span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="" class="">s
Theropoda indet. in his thesis.  Three partial cervical vertebrae
were originally placed in this specimen, but Ezcurra states "these
vertebrae are smaller than expected for a single individual in
comparison with the hindlimb bones and they do not show neotheropod
apomorphies (e.g., pleurocoels).  As a result, these three
articulated cervical vertebrae were tentatively excluded from PVL
3848."  They are placed here tentatively as Saurischia
indet..  Ezcurra writes "PVL 3848 could not be located in the
collections of the PVL after several visits of the author during the
last ten years and should be considered currently lost (J. Powell pers.
comm., 2015)."<br>

<b>Podokesauridae</b>- Podokesauridae was first proposed by Huene
(1914a) as a basal grade of coelurosaurs (sensu Huene). This position
was retained throughout the mid-1900's, with podokesaurids seen as
directly ancestral to coelurids, and less directly to compsognathids
and ornithomimids. Barsbold (1977) had podokesaurids ancestral to all
theropods, and coelurids and troodontids in particular. Huene (1914a)
originally included <i>Podokesaurus</i>, <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Saltopus</i>
and <i>Tanystropheus</i>. Later added were <i>Procompsognathus</i>
(Huene, 1914b), <i>Halticosaurus</i> (Huene, 1914b), <i>Procerosaurus</i>
(Huene, 1920), <i>Avipes</i> (Huene, 1932), <i>Spinosuchus</i>
(Huene, 1932), <i>Dolichosuchus</i> (Romer, 1956), <i>Lukousaurus</i>
(Romer, 1956), <i>Velocipes</i> (Romer, 1956), <i>Trialestes</i>
(Reig, 1963; as <i>Triassolestes</i>), <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>
(Raath, 1969; as <i>Syntarsus</i>), <i>Dilophosaurus</i> (Russell,
1984), <i>Alwalkeria</i> (Chatterjee, 1987; as <i>Walkeria</i>), <i>Segisaurus</i>
(Carroll, 1988), "Comanchesaurus" (Hunt and Lucas, 1989), <i>Sarcosaurus</i>
(Madsen and Welles, 2000) and <i>Liliensternus</i> (earlier as <i>Halticosaurus
liliensterni</i>, then explicitly by Madsen and Welles, 2000). The
family was generally not used after the 1980's, with its genera then
referred to as ceratosaurs, coelophysoids and/or coelophysids. Madsen
and Welles (2000) correctly noted that Podokesauridae has priority over
Coelophysidae according to the ICZN, since it was named fourteen years
earlier. Yet all other workers ignore this, generally because they
value Phylocode rules and Podokesauridae has not been phylogenetically
defined, or they misread the ICZN to demand family-level eponyms be
diagnosable (it actually only says they must be valid). Coelophysidae
is only used on this website because of its near universal usage since
1991.<br>
Nopcsa (1923) changed it to subfamily Podokesaurinae within
Hallopodidae, which has not been followed as <i>Hallopus</i> is a
crocodylomorph.<br>
<b>Coelophysidae</b>- Welles (1984) erected Coelophysidae from Nopcsa's
earlier subfamily Coelophysinae, including <i>Coelophysis</i> and <i>Sarcosaurus</i>
without comment. Paul (1988) later included <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Dilophosaurus</i>,
<i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Coelophysis
rhodesiensis</i> in the family. This was followed by Novas (1991,
1992), though Holtz (1994) restricted the term to exclude the basal <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.
This is followed by all workers currently yet the precise extent of
Coelophysidae has since been controversial, sometimes including <i>Liliensternus</i>
(Carrano et al., 2002), and sometimes restricted to <i>Coelophysis </i>(Rauhut,
2003). This depends both on the definition used and the resolution
within derived Coelophysoidea. An intermediate extent is used here,
based on the definition in Holtz (1994) and the analysis of Tykoski
(2005).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Procompsognathidae</span>- Huene
(1929) separated <i>Procompsognathus</i> from podokesaurids as a new
family Procompsognathidae, which was not followed by many authors
through the 1900's. Huene (1932) included <i>Pterospondylus</i> as
well, which was often viewed as a synonym of <i>Procompsognathus</i>.
Romer (1966) and others have incorrectly used this as a senior synonym
of Podokesauridae, including <i>Avipes</i>, <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Dolichosuchus</i>,
<i>Halticosaurus</i>, <i>Lukousaurus</i>, <i>Podokesaurus</i>, <i>Procompsognathus</i>,
<i>Saltopus</i>, <i>Scleromochlus</i>, <i>Spinosuchus</i>, <i>Trialestes</i>
and <i>Velocipes</i> in the family. Steel (1970) only included <i>Procompsognathus</i>
and <i>Halticosaurus</i>. Welles (1984) and Paul (1988) both only
included <i>Procompsognathus</i> in the family. Procompsognathidae has
not been used since the 1980's, as <i>Procompsognathus</i> has most
often been viewed as a coelophysoid incertae sedis or coelophysid, and
was even made an internal specifier of Coelophysidae by Sereno (1998).
Yet if the genus is a basal dinosauriform as Allen (2004) believes, the
family may be justified again.<br>
<b>Segisauridae</b>- Segisauridae was established by Camp (1936) to
include only <i>Segisaurus</i>, viewed as related to coelurids and
compsognathids within Coelurosauria sensu Huene. This practice was
followed until Gauthier (1986) determined that <i>Segisaurus</i> was a
ceratosaur sensu lato. Segisauridae has been almost unused since, with <i>Segisaurus</i>
being placed in Coelophysoidea and/or Coelophysidae instead (Sereno,
1997). If Coelophysidae is restricted to <i>Coelophysis</i>, as
defined in Tykoski and Rowe (2004), then Segisauridae may be used for
its sister clade, including <i>Segisaurus</i>, <i>"Syntarsus"
kayentakatae</i> and perhaps <i>Camposaurus</i>. On this site they are
grouped as Segisaurinae within Coelophysidae.<br>
<b>Ex-coelophysids</b>- Huene (1914) included <i>Saltopus</i> as one
of his original podokesaurids, placing it ancestral to <i>Halticosaurus</i>.
This placement was common, though current research indicates it is most
likely a more basal dinosauriform (Langer, 2004). <i>Tanystropheus</i>
is another original podokesaurid of Huene's, but is now known to be a
protorosaur (Wild, 1973). Several species (<i>T. bauri</i>, <i>T.
longicollis</i> and <i>T. willistoni</i>) are now recognized as
coelophysids however. <i>Halticosaurus</i> was assigned to
Podokesauridae (Huene, 1914) by many authors and indeed seems to be
coelophysoid, though its short cervical centra exclude it from
Coelophysidae as used here. <i>Procompsognathus</i> was soon placed in
Podokesauridae by Huene (1914), which has been supported by some recent
analyses (Ezcurra and Novas, 2006) and rejected by others (Allen,
2004). <i>Procerosaurus</i> was assigned to Podokesauridae by Huene
(1920), but is actually a junior synonym of <i>Tanystropheus</i>
(Wild, 1973). <i>Spinosuchus</i> was first described as a <i>Coelophysis</i>
specimen (Case, 1922), and was later referred to Podokesauridae once it
was placed in its own genus by Huene (1932). Nesbitt et al. (2007) have
most recently assigned it to Archosauriformes <i>incertae sedis</i>. <i>Avipes</i>
was first described as a podokesaurid (Huene, 1932), but recent studies
have been unable to place it more definitively than Avemetatarsalia
(Rauhut and Hungerbuhler, 2000). <i>Lukousaurus</i> was originally
described as a coelurosaur related to <i>Podokesaurus</i>, <i>Procompsognathus</i>
and <i>Saltopus</i> (Young, 1948), and explicitly placed in
Podokesauridae by Romer (1956). It has not been recently restudied, but
lacks several coelophysoid apomorphies and is more likely crurotarsan. <i>Velocipes</i>
was placed in Podokesauridae by Romer (1956), yet like <i>Avipes</i>,
recent studies have been unable to place it more definitively than
Avemetatarsalia (Rauhut and Hungerbuhler, 2000). <i>Dolichosuchus</i>
was similarly placed in Podokesauridae by Romer (1956), but Welles
(1984) notes it is almost identical to <i>Liliensternus</i>, so it is
possibly just outside Coelophysidae. Reig (1963) assigned <i>Trialestes</i>
(as <i>Triassolestes</i>) to Podokesauridae. Romer (1972) properly
recognized it as a crurotarsan, though it does have several
dinosaur-like characters. Russell (1984) assigned <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
to the Podokesauridae, though following Holtz (1994), it is now
considered just basal to Coelophysidae. Welles (1984) placed <i>Sarcosaurus</i>
in Coelophysidae without comment, while Madsen and Welles (2000) placed
it in Podokesauridae, but it appears to represent a more basal
coelophysoid (Tykoski, 2005). <i>Protoavis</i> was originally believed
to be a juvenile <i>Coelophysis</i> (Chatterjee, 1986), and while some
material is coelophysoid (Nesbitt et al., 2007), none can be assigned
to Coelophysidae itself with certainty. (Chatterjee (1987) assigned his
new genus <i>Walkeria</i> to Podokesauridae, but it has since been
renamed <i>Alwalkeria</i> and placed more basally as a basal
eusaurichian (Langer, 2004). <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> was assigned to
Coelophysidae by a couple authors (Paul, 1988; Novas, 1992) before it
was realized to be a ceratosaur sensu lato (Holtz, 1994), which has
been the result of every published cladistic analysis. <i>Liliensternus</i>
is often assigned to Coelophysidae (e.g. Paul, 1988) and was often
viewed as a podokesaurid when still classified as a species of <i>Halticosaurus</i>,
yet based on the present definition of Coelophysidae is just barely
excluded from that clade. "Comanchesaurus" was listed as a podokesaurid
by Hunt and Lucas (1989), though it more recently could not be
definitely placed closer to <i>Coelophysis</i> than <i>Liliensternus</i>
(Nesbitt et al., 2007). Sullivan and Lucas (1999) believed their new
taxon <i>Eucoelophysis</i> to be most closely related to <i>Coelophysis</i>,
but Ezcurra (2006) has since determined it to be a more basal
dinosauriform. Rauhut (2003) found <i>Shuvosaurus</i> to fall out as a
coelophysid in his analysis, sister to <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>,
but the description of <i>Effigia</i> (Nesbitt and Norell, 2006) led
to its recognition as a crurotarsan.<br>
<b>Defining Coelophysidae</b>- Holtz (1994) first defined
Coelophysidae, as the most exclusive clade containing <i>Coelophysis
bauri</i>, <i>Syntarsus rhodesiensis</i> and <i>S. kayentakatae</i>.
This matches its use in recent papers such as Tykoski (2005) and
Ezcurra and Novas (2006). Two other definitions have been proposed for
Coelophysidae, neither one ideal. Sereno (1998) used <i>Procompsognathus</i>
and <i>Coelophysis</i> as internal specifiers. Yet <i>Procompsognathus</i>
may not be dinosaurian (Allen, 2004), in which case all of Dinosauria
would be coelophysids according to his definition. Even when <i>Procompsognathus</i>
is found to be a coelophysoid, it usually has an uncertain position
within the clade. Tykoski (2005) found it could fall it anywhere in the
<i>Liliensternus</i> + <i>Coelophysis</i> clade. Ezcurra and Novas
(2006) found it only slightly more constrained, within the <i>Zupaysaurus</i>
+ <i>Coelophysis</i> clade. Under this definition, Coelophysidae has
an extremely uncertain content, which may include <i>Liliensternus</i>,
<i>Zupaysaurus</i>, <i>Segisaurus</i>, etc. or may not. Tykoski and
Rowe (2004) proposed a definition which used <i>Coelophysis bauri</i>
and <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> as internal specifiers. This is
easy to apply to most analyses, where the two emerge as sister taxa.
However, this would exclude not only <i>Liliensternus</i>, <i>Zupaysaurus</i>
and <i>Lophostropheus</i> from Coelophysidae, but also <i>Segisaurus</i>
and <i>"Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>. This is far more exclusive than
most concepts of Coelophysidae (or Podokesauridae) have been. Also, the
synapomorphies for <i>Coelophysis</i> are all cranial, making the
assignment of postcrania to Coelophysidae impossible.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered on August
21 1982, UCMP 129618 was described by Padian (1986) as a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>. 
This was because "compared to the type material. they correspond
exactly in both size and detail to the largest pieces in Cope's
collection", although Padian did state "there are differences between
the Ghost Ranch [ = '<span style="font-style: italic;">Rioarribasaurus</span>',
= <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
neotype quarry] and Petrified Forest specimens that may require
taxonomic reevaluation when full descriptions of the former are
published."  Hunt and Lucas (1991) agreed, calling it the Lacey
Point theropod "and note several differences including better
development of the posteroventral arch of the ilium ... a distinct
emargination on the distal tibia for reception of the ascending process
of the astragalus ... a much more distinctly offset [femoral] head ...
a shorter fourth trochanter ... a less well developed trochanteric
shelf [and] a well developed obturator foramen."  They concluded
"UCMP 129618 represents a ceratosaurian ... distinct from <span style="font-style: italic;">Rioarribasaurus</span> that probably
merits a new generic name."  Hunt et al. (1998) stated it differed
from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
neotype in having "(1) femoral head more offset from the femoral shaft,
with a deep groove on the proximal face of the head and a concave
distal margin to the head so that the medioventral corner of the head
forms a ventrally directed point; (2) a tibia with a more robust
cnemial crest and very large crest for attachment of the flexor muscle
and ligaments on the anterior face; (3) a larger ascending process of
astragalus; (4) an ilium with larger supra-acetabular crest and
proportionally shorter posterior blade; and (5) proximal tarsals that
are more flared."  de Ricqlès et al. (2003) and Padian et al.
(2004) reported on its histology.  Irmis (2005) stated "It is
likely, given the morphological and temporal differences between the
Petrified Forest and Ghost Ranch material, that they represent separate
taxa (Parker and Irmis, in press). Therefore, we refer the Petrified
Forest material to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
sp. pending description of the new material."  Unfortunately, the
resulting Parker and Irmis (2005) publication didn't comment on
differences or taxonomy, still calling it <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
sp..  Nesbitt et al. (2007) stated "Recent recovery of new
specimens of the same taxon from equivalent strata in Petrified Forest
National Park suggests that the Petrified Forest taxon is generally
larger and more robust than the Ghost Ranch material" and referred it
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> sp. without
justification.  Spielmann et al. (2007) incorrectly stated "no
specific differences have been enumerated in the literature" and
provided high resolution photos of most pelvic and hindlimb
elements.  While they believed the morphological, temporal and
geographical similarity with <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>
and the Snyder Quarry coelophysid made it "most parsimonious to assign
both to the same taxon" and thus referred UCMP 129618 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>, they only listed
characters which would place it closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>. 
Cabreira et al. (2016) first included the specimen in a phylogenetic
analysis as the Petrified Forest theropod where it emerges in a
trichotomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>+Coelophysidae,
but with a small sample size of coelophysoid-grade taxa and no
averostrans this precise placement is poorly supported.  Wang et
al. (2017) included this in an independent analysis and recovered it as
a coelophysoid just outside Coelophysidae.  Ezcurra
(2017) called this Padian's <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>,
and stated it differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">C. bauri</span>
(USNM 529376) in lacking a femoral extensor fossa.  Marsh and
Parker (2020) figured much of the specimen and referred it "to the
Coelophysidae owing to the presence of the infrapopliteal ridge on the
distal end of the femur and the coossifed proximal tarsals" although
they mentioned these also occur in some ceratosaurs.  Preliminary
comparisons suggest it is a coelophysid based on the fused metatarsal
III and distal tarsal III, but is not a coelophysine based on the
rounded anteromedial corner of the femur in distal view.<br>
Two of "several theropods" mentioned by Stocker et al. (2004) in an
abstract, Parker and Irmis (2005) comment on "the partial skeletons of
three coelophysoids. These specimens have not yet been completely
prepared, though preliminary research has shown them to be identical to
UCMP 129618."  Discovered in 2004 and apparently not catalogued
yet, Parker and Irmis figure the proximal femur of what would be PEFO
22983 and what is presumably the distal left femur of PEFO 33981 as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
sp. ... from PFV 231."  Nesbitt et al. (2007) mention two partial
skeletons from the Giving Site (PEFO 33981 and 33983) as being the same
taxon as UCMP 129618 based on greater size and robusticity than the <span style="font-style: italic;">C. bauri</span> material from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry.  Marsh and Parker (2020) figured some of their elements
and referred both to Coelophysidae for the same reasons as UCMP
129618.  Parker and Irmis' third partial skeleton ended up being
shuvosaurid PEFO 33953 (Parker, pers. comm. 2021).  Most recently,
Ezcurra et al. (2021) finds "PEFO 21373/UCMP
129618 and PEFO 33983 possess a unique combination of character states
that allows assigning both to a single, new species of neotheropod. The
third specimen [PEFO 33981] has a congruent morphology, but lacks
preservation of key features, preventing an unambiguous referral to the
new taxon. A phylogenetic analysis [presumably Nesbitt's modified by
Ezcurra] found the new taxon as one of the earliest branching
coelophysoids, outside Coelophysidae (<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
+ <span style="font-style: italic;">Megapnosaurus</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">"Syntarsus"</span>)."<br>
Hunt and Wright (1999) note a specimen found in 1999 at the Jeremiah's
Perch locality which they assign to the same species as UCMP 129618,
stating it "is currently only partially excavated, but it includes at
least femora, tibiae, cervical vertebrae, teeth as well as many other
elements."  Marsh and Parker (2020) stated it "was recently
returned and prepared at PEFO."<br>

Initially catalogued at MCZ 8817 (Tykoski, 1998), at least some have
since been recatalogued as MCZ 9442-9469 and TMM 43689 (Tykoski, 2005).
Tykoski (1998) used MCZ 8817a-s as preliminary labels for some
specimens, but it is unknown which numbers most of these specimens are
now catalogued under.  It is assigned to Coelophysidae here based
on tibiotarsal fusion.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This material was discovered after 2000 and initially
described as <i>Lucianosaurus bonoi</i> (Martinez and Apaldetti, 2017
online) in an April 17 2017 preprint, which Creisler (DML, 2017) noted
was preoccupied by the archosauromorph tooth taxon <i>Lucianosaurus
wildi</i> (Hunt and Lucas, 1994). Martinez and Apaldetti (2017) quickly
corrected their draft on May 11 2017 with the new genus name <i>Lucianovenator</i>.  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Lucianosaurus</span> was never
registered with ZooBank, though <i>Lucianovenator</i> has a ZooBank
entry but no explicit statement of ZooBank registration in its
publication. Thus both names were considered nomina nuda pending
physical publication (ICZN Article 8.5.3), which occured in November
2017 for <span style="font-style: italic;">Lucianovenator</span>.<br>
Martinez and Apaldetti recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Lucianovenator</span>
as a coelophysid in a trichotomy with <i>Camposaurus</i> and <i>Coelophysis?
rhodesiensis</i> using a version of Nesbitt et al.'s dinosaur analysis.
Only one or two steps are needed to shift the genus to another position
within Coelophysidae, but moving it outside the clade requires 8 or
more steps.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Tykoski and Rowe, 2004) nasal crests; frontals
separated by midline anterior extension of parietals.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Tykoski and Rowe (2004) listed transverse
groove on anterior astragalar surface as an additional diagnostic
feature of this species, but it is also present in <i>Coelophysis bauri</i>
and the Shake-n-Bake coelophysid (Tykoski, 2005).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The 'juveniles' previously referred (Rowe, 1989; MCZ
8817) are actually the distinct "Shake-n-Bake" coelophysid (Tykoski,
1998). The sacral and caudal material assigned to the holotype may
belong to the other two individuals with the same specimen number.
Tykoski (2005) found this species to be more closely related to <i>Segisaurus</i>
than to <i>Coelophysis</i>. 
Barta et al. (2018) suggested metacarpal I and phalanx II-2 of Tykoski
may be  phalanx I-1 or II-1 and II-1 or III-2/3 respectively.<br>
UCMP V128659 was discovered in 1982 and referred to <i>Syntarsus
kayentakatae</i> by Rowe (1989), as a subadult gracile individual.
Tykoski (1998) did not examine it for his redescription of the species,
but later (2005) examined it for his PhD thesis and considered it to be
"probably referrable to "<i>Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>" without
discussion. Gay (2010) described the specimen as the new tetanurine
taxon <i>Kayentavenator elysiae</i>. However, the description and
analysis contain numerous errors, and a placement in Coelophysidae
seems correct, though there is no published evidence <i>Kayentavenator</i>
is the same taxon as <i>kayentakatae</i>. Excurra (2012) did find the
two to be sister taxa and recommended synonymy based on an unpublished
analysis though.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Munter, 1999) ilia contact dorsally on midline
(may be taphonomic).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1994, Munter (1999) found IGM 6624 to be
sister to <i>"Syntarsus</i>" based on the antitrochanter projecting
into the acetabulum (though this is also present in <i>Coelophysis
bauri </i>and<i> Liliensternus</i>). It differs in having ilia contact
sacral neural spines two and three. The skull fragments may not belong
to the same taxon and were thought to be a neoceratosaur or
maniraptoran by Munter due to their pneumatized paroccipital roots.
However, this has since been found to exist in coelophysids such as <i>"S."
kayentakatae</i>. Hernandez (2002) erected a new species <i>Syntarsus
mexicanum</i> from the locality, which is probably based on IGM 6624
since no other coelophysoid specimens have been reported from there and
Munter emphasized similarity to what he called <i>Syntarsus</i>.
However, it is a nomen nudum for not including a diagnosis (ICZN
13.1.1) or a type specimen (ICZN 16.4.1). Hernandez also mentioned
cranial elements of <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, which are probably IGM 6625
based on Munter's comparison to neoceratosaurs. Munter and Clark later
(2006) described the specimens and included IGM 6624 in Carrano et
al.'s (2002) matrix where it emerged sister to <i>Coelophysis</i>
(excluded due to lacking fused sacral neural spines), and Rauhut's
(2003) matrix where it was in the clade of <i>Coelophysis</i> (the
latter including <i>kayentakatae</i>). They considered IGM 6625
provisionally theropod. The only potential apomorphy noted in the
material has been the ilia which meet at the midline, but this may be
taphonomic. Munter and Clark note that the dorsally oriented acetabulum
suggests distortion, but the rugose medial ilial surface suggesting
contact with the other ilium and general lack of distortion in other
fossils from the locality suggests it was natural. Ezcurra (2012) found
the specimen to be closer to <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Segisaurus</i>
and <i>Camposaurus</i> than <i>kayentakatae</i> based on a large
unpublished analysis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Nopcsa (1923) named this subfamily within
Compsognathidae, separate from Compsognathinae and Ornithomiminae. This
was not followed, though Sereno (1998) later used it as a subfamily of
Coelophysidae to contain <i>Procompsognathus</i> and <i>Segisaurus</i>,
separate from the coelophysine <i>Coelophysis</i>. This was not found
in future studies (e.g. Tykoski, 2005; Ezcurra and Novas, 2007;
Ezcurra, 2012), where <i>Procompsognathus</i> instead has a more
unstable position more derived than <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. This makes
the utility of Procompsognathinae questionable and the application of
Sereno's definition to any taxon except <i>Procompsognathus</i> itself
impossible. If <i>Procompsognathus</i> is non-dinosaurian as Allen
(2004) suggests, Procompsognathinae may have some use depending on its
exact relationships.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut, 2000) scapula more slender than <i>Coelophysis
bauri</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Hallopus</i> "celerrimus" is probably a synonym of
<i>Procompsognathus triassicus</i>, according to Molnar (pers. comm.).
He suspects this based on the fact they come from the same locality and
beds, were proposed by the same person, and Fraas never used the name <i>Hallopus</i>
"celerrimus" after he published <i>Procompsognathus triassicus</i>.<br>
<i>Procompsognathus</i> was found in 1909. It was described based on a
postcranial skeleton (SMNS 12591) and skull (SMNS 12591a), which were
long assumed to belong to the same individual but probably do not based
on the differently colored matrix and small size of the skull compared
to <i>Coelophysis</i>' proportions (Knoll, 2008). Huene (1921)
referred another skull (SMNS 12352) and manus (SMNS 12352a) to the
taxon, but these are now agreed to be crocodylomorphan (Welles, 1984;
Sereno and Wild, 1992; Knoll and Rohrberg, 2012). Huene (1921) also
referred parts of the <i>Saltoposuchus</i> type slab (SMNS 12597) to <i>Procompsognathus</i>,
but these were agreed to be <i>Saltoposuchus</i> by Crush (1984).<br>
Sereno and Wild (1992) considered the skull SMNS 12591a to belong to <i>Saltoposuchus
connectens</i>, while Chatterjee (1993, 1998) believed it to be
theropod. Allen (2004) believes the skull belongs to the same taxon as
the postcrania, and based on cladistic analyses both including and
excluding the former, places <i>Procompsognathus</i> as a
non-dinosaurian avemetatarsalian. Knoll and Schoch (2006) tentatively
stated the skull was tetanurine based on a supposed maxillary fenestra,
yet Knoll and Rohrberg (2012) figure it as Theropoda indet.. Ezcurra
(2012) found <i>Procompsognathus</i> to be a non-coelophysid
coelophysoid sensu stricto in a large unpublished analysis, though it
was unreported if the skull was coded.<br>

(modified)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(suggested) promaxillary fenestra absent; lateral dentary groove
absent; humerus straight in lateral view; angled anteromedial corner of
femur in distal view.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Although originally proposed by Nopcsa in 1928 to only
include <i>Coelophysis</i> (and not <i>Podokesaurus, Procerosaurus,
Saltopus</i> or <i>Tanystropheus</i>), this subfamily went largely
unused until Paul (1988) used it for <i>Coelophysis</i> and <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>,
to separate them from the halticosaurine <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.
Sereno (1998) then used it to group <i>Coelophysis bauri</i> and <i>Megapnosaurus
rhodesiensis</i>, defining it to include <i>Coelophysis</i> and
exclude <i>Procompsognathus</i>. In Sereno's topology, this also
excluded <i>Segisaurus</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i>. Yet subsequent
studies (e.g. Tykoski, 2005; Ezcurra and Rautian, 2006) have shown <i>Procompsognathus</i>
to have an uncertain placement within derived coelophysoids, making the
precise application of Sereno's definition impossible and the content
of his Coelophysinae (besides <i>Coelophysis</i> itself) unknown.
Carrano et al. (2002) later used Coelophysinae for a <i>rhodesiensis</i>
+ <i>bauri</i> clade, excluding <i>Liliensternus</i>. Taking these
prior uses into account, Coelophysinae is here used for the <i>rhodesiensis</i>
+ <i>bauri</i> clade, but with <i>Segisaurus</i> as the external
specifier instead of <i>Procompsognathus</i>. This is a clade
recovered in most phylogenetic analyses where coelophysid
interrelationships are resolved (e.g. Tykoski, 2005; Ezcurra and Novas,
2007) and is equivalent to Sereno's Coelophysinae in content. Ezcurra
(2012) found this to only include <i>Coelophysis bauri</i> however,
with <i>kayentakatae</i> more basal, and <i>Camposaurus</i> and <i>rhodesiensis</i>
as segisaurines.<br>
Segisaurinae was based on Camp's family Segisauridae and is used here
for the clade formed by <i>Segisaurus</i>, <i>"Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>
and possibly <i>Camposaurus</i> recovered by Tykoski (2005). Such a
clade was not recovered by Ezcurra and Novas (2006), where <i>"Syntarsus"
kayentakatae</i> was instead closer to <i>Coelophysis</i> than to <i>Segisaurus</i>.
Similarly, it was not recovered in Ezcurra (2012) where <i>Camposaurus</i>
and <i>rhodesiensis</i> are segisaurines, and <i>kayentakatae</i> is
a basal coelophysid. <br>
Kalandadze and Rautian (1991) proposed the subfamily Syntarsiinae, but
this cannot be used for a theropod group, as <i>Syntarsus</i> is the
name of a beetle (Ivie et al., 2001).<br>

<b>Material</b>- (MNA.V.1968) teeth(?), dorsal ribs, gastralia,

(MNA.V.2588) (centra 34-37 mm) fourth sacral centrum, fifth sacral
centrum, first caudal centrum, second caudal centrum, third caudal
centrum, ilium (196 mm), proximal pubis, ischia (172 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in 1986, this material was first reported in an abstract by
Morales (1994) who stated it "may represent two individuals" and
mentioned "phalanges; and some isolated teeth" not noted in the
eventual description by Lucas and Heckert (2001) but which may be some
of "the remaining bones" of MNA.V.1968 that are said to be
undiagnostic.  When Morales stated "Distally the pubes are fused
forming a rod-like (not plate-like) pubic shaft and ending as a single
united expansion (a knob, not a pubic "foot")", he was describing the
distal ischia of MNA.V.1968.  Also, Morales' statement "the part
of
the pubic plate where the obturator foramen and pubic fenestra might
lie, is not preserved" is incorrect, as Lucas and Heckert find "One
foramen is well demarcated, but whether this is the obtuator foramen or
an additional pubic fenestra is uncertain."<br>
Morales (1994) believed "The shape and relative size of the brevis
shelf of the ilium and the degree of ventrolateral expansion of the
supracetabular crest is more similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span>" than <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>,
but did not assign it to a genus.  Lucas and Heckert (2001)
thought the level of the ilioischial suture was "different from the
photographic illustration of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
by COLBERT (1989: fig. 76)", but must have mistaken a more ventral
break in that figure for the suture, which is not visible and thus
probably completely fused.  Similarly, when they state the
inturned femoral head is "more marked than that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
illustrated by COLBERT (1989: fig. 80)", the latter is an innacurate
drawing as detailed by Downs.  They conclude "the pelves described
here closely conform to descriptions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus rhodesiensis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">S. kayentakatae</span> (RAATH 1977,
TYKOSKI 1998), so we assign them to <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span>
sp.", also noting they are larger than the Shake-N-Bake
coelophysid.  Lucas and Heckert also state "the pubes fuse to the
ischia slightly posterior of the midpoint of the acetabulum, which is
positioned farther posteriorly than in <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>and
may represent a unique or species-level distinction."  Wang et al.
(2017) is the only publication to include the specimen in an analysis
(as "Moenave Coelophysoid"), where it emerged as a coelophysid in a
polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Megapnosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span>.  It is
assigned to Coelophysinae here based on the shallow ilium with concave
dorsal margin.<br>

MNA.V.2777 and UCMP 177314, but these are not referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> here.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype tibiotarsi were collected in 1934 and first published by
Murry and Long (1989), who said "Theropod bones (tarsi, sacral and
distal vertebrae) are present in the University of California Museum of
Paleontology collections from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Placerias</span>
Quarry."  Lucas et al. (1992) later figured and mentioned them as
"fused ankles that consist of the distal ends of co-ossified
tibiae-fibulae-astragalae. These bones probably pertain to
ceratosaurian theropods."  Long and Murry (1995) figured one of
the tibiotarsi as Ceratosauria indet. and described them as Theropoda
indet., but noted the straight distal margin in anterior/posterior view
"differs from that seen within other primitive theropods" including
UCMP 129618, and that the less concave anterior margin later found to
be diagnostic was different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
at least.  Hunt et al. (1998) included UCMP 34498 in "A large
number of dissociated, similar-sized theropod postcranial specimens,
with no duplication of elements" that they believed "represent a single
individual" of their new taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus
arizonensis</span> (see below for paratype material).  They
referred <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> to
Ceratosauria sensu lato based on the fused astragalocalcanea, and
thought it was most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">rhodesiensis</span> (their <span style="font-style: italic;">Rioarribasaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Syntarsus</span>) in the fused
tibiotarsus.  Downs (2000) states <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>
"was founded on hind
limb and tarsal characters which are contrasted with <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> characters illustrated
[incorrectly by L. Darling] in Colbert's monograph.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> appears to fall easily
within the range of variation seen in the Ghost Ranch sample of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> and is thus a nomen
dubium."  Irmis (2005) agreed, stating "direct comparison of <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> with casts of
corresponding elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span> from the Ghost Ranch <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry shows that they are identical."  Nesbitt et al. (2005,
2007) agreed it cannot be distinguished based on the straight distal
margin, claiming they "could not corroborate this difference when
directly comparing '<span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>'
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
(AMNH FR 30614 and AMNH FR 30615)", but their own figure 5 shows the
opposite.  Similarly, they say "One difference between '<span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>,' some specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
and all other theropods is that in ventral view, the concave depression
on the anterior side of the astragalus is much stronger and more abrupt
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>;
however, some specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span> have a morphology identical to '<span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>'", referring to AMNH
30614 in their Figure 5.  Yet that specimen clearly has the
medially extensive anterior groove of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>
and most other theropods, and is merely compressed anteroposteriorly to
make the depression appear shallow.  Tykoski (2005) stated the
presence of fibulocalcanear fusion is otherwise only seen in <i>"Syntarsus"
kayentakatae</i>, though otherwise the material could not be placed
more precisely within the <i>Coelophysis</i>&lt;<i>Liliensternus</i>
clade. The holotype was reanalyzed by Ezcurra and Brusatte (2011), who
argued several characters can distinguish <i>Camposaurus</i> from
other named taxa, including the straighter distal and anterior
astragalocalcanear margins. The authors added <i>Camposaurus</i> to
Nesbitt's dinosauromorph analysis, finding it to be a coelophysid
closer to <i>rhodesiensis</i> than to <i>Coelophysis bauri</i> and <i>kayentakatae</i>.
Similarly, Ezcurra (2012) found <i>Camposaurus</i> to be closer to <i>rhodesiensis</i>
and <i>Segisaurus</i> than to <i>Coelophysis bauri</i> and <i>kayentakatae</i>
based on a large unpublished analysis. Wang et al. (2017) recovered it
as a coelophysid in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">rhodesiensis</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Referred material</span>-
Hunt et al. (1998) included several elements from the same locality as
paratypes, but future authors such as Nesbitt et al. (2007) and Ezcurra
and Brusatte (2011) have excluded these "Given that the holotype and
referred specimens were discovered in a quarry containing the bones of
many taxa and individuals, and that there is no clear association
between them."  <br>
Proximal femur UCMP 139622 (UCMP uncatalogued in Hunt et al., 1998) has
since been assigned to Saurischia by Irmis (2005) and the more
rectangular head suggested by Hunt et al. as diagnostic is indeed
different from coelophysoid-grade taxa.  Dorsal centra MNA.V.3091
('MNA V2777' in Hunt et al.) and UCMP 177314 (UCMP uncatalogued in Hunt
et al.), partial synsacrum UCMP 138591, and fragmentary synsacra UCMP
178047, 178048 and 178049 (all UCMP uncatalogued in Hunt et al.) were
all placed in Archosauria indet. by Nesbitt et al. (2007) as "they are
equally comparable to many dinosauriforms as well as <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvosaurus</span>."  <br>
Proximal pubis UCMP 177318 was tentatively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> by Hunt et al. (1998),
but is reassigned to Archosauria indet. here.<br>
Tykoski (2005)
referred to "a piece of the right pelvic girdle that includes the
acetabular border formed by fusion of the pubic peduncle of the ilium
and the proximal pubis (UCMP 25791)" as possibly from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span> type individual. 
This had only been previously published as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Rutiodon</span>
specimen preserving a "Pubic tubercle reduced to a rugosity" by
Hutchinson (2001), and is in the UCMP online catalogue as a reptilian
ulna discovered in 1934.  It's possible Tykoski confused this with
UCMP
177318 noted above, but this is a left proximal pubis that shows no
evidence of fusion with the ilium.<br>
Nesbitt et al. (2007) say distal femur UCMP 25834 and distal tibia UCMP
25820 from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Placerias</span>
Quarry may belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>,
but neither has been figured or supported with autapomorphies, although
the tibia could potentially be examined for <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>' distinctive ridge and
tuberosity.<br>
Ezcurra and Brusatte (2011) noted Hayden Quarry coelophysid tibiotarsus
GR 227 shares all of their proposed <i>Camposaurus</i> apomorphies,
which could mean the Hayden Quarry material is referrable to that
taxon. This is not formalized here as the Hayden material is
undescribed and from a higher stratigraphic level than <i>Camposaurus</i>.

announced "several individuals of a large
coelophysoid theropod" from the Hayden quarry, of which a tibiotarsus
was figured by Irmis et al. (2007). Nesbitt and Stocker (2008) mention
astragalocalcaneum GR 211, which was also listed in the appendix of
Whiteside et al. (2015) as a coelophysid. Barta et al. (2018) figure a
metacarpus GR 1033 that fuses distal carpal III to the semilunate
carpal.  The material has yet to be described. Ezcurra and
Brusatte (2011) noted GR 227 shares all of their proposed <i>Camposaurus</i>
apomorphies, which could mean the Hayden quarry material is referrable
to that taxon. This is not formalized here as the Hayden material is
undescribed and from a higher stratigraphic level than <i>Camposaurus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The Snyder Quarry coelophysoid material (NMMNH
P-29046-29047, 30779-30780, 30852, 31293-31661) was originally referred
to <i>Eucoelophysis sp.</i> by Heckert et al. (2000) based on supposed
similarities in the scapulocoracoid, ischium and tibia. Nesbitt et al.
(2007) showed the former genus is non-dinosaurian while Heckert et
al.'s material exhibits numerous dinosaur, theropod and coelophysoid
synapomorphies. <i>Eucoelophysis</i>' holotype differs in lacking a
distinct acetabular rim on the ischium, an offset femoral head, a
differentiated lateral and fibular condyle that is separated by a
distinct sulcus, and a well developed curved cnemial crest. The
appressed lateral tibial surface is developed differently in both taxa.
Ezcurra (2006) noted NMMNH P-30852 shows an alveolar ridge like <i>Liliensternus</i>
and coelophysoids, and a square anterior end on the antorbital fossa as
in <i>Zupaysaurus</i> and coelophysoids. Spielmann et al. (2007)
redescribed the material (including newly identified NMMNH
P-54617-54620), assigning it to <i>Coelophysis bauri</i> based on
NMMNH P-30852 lacking a promaxillary fenestra (also in <i>Coelophysis
rhodesiensis</i>) and having a ventrally broad lacrimal. The other
Snyder Quarry material was assigned to the same species based on
general similarity and close association, though the other specimens
were only identified to more inclusive taxa based on their own
morphologies. While Spielmann et al. identified NMMNH P-54618-54620 as <i>Coelophysis</i>
based on the transverse proximal femoral groove, this is also present
in <i>Kayentavenator</i>.
Wang et al. (2017) are the only publication to add the material to a
phylogenetic analysis, recovering it as the most basal coelophysoid,
outside Coelophysidae.<br>

<i><b>= </b>Megapnosaurus</i> Ivie, Slipinski and Wegrzynowicz, 2001 <br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>"Syntarsus"</i>/<i>Megapnosaurus</i> is often
synonymized with <i>Coelophysis</i> (Paul, 1988; Bristowe and Raath,
2004), as new discoveries invalidate supposed differences between the
taxa (e.g. Downs, 2000; Bristowe and Raath, 2004). In 2001, Ivie et al.
discovered that <i>Syntarsus</i> was preoccupied by a zopherid beetle
(Fairmaire, 1869). The entomologists who determined this attempted
unsuccessfully to contact Raath so that he could rename it, and ended
up renaming it themselves. Paleontologists might have reacted more
positively if the replacement name (<i>Megapnosaurus</i>) hadn't been
facetious, translating to "big dead lizard", since that's what all
dinosaurs are to entomologists. Thus the trend has been to ignore the
name, a position made easier by its resemblence to <i>Coelophysis</i>.
However, a large unpublished analysis by Ezcurra (2012) has found <i>rhodesiensis</i>
to be a segisaurine, complicating taxonomy if this is found to be well
supported.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Tykoski, 1998) anterior pedunclar foramina in
cervical vertebrae (unknown in <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>).<br>
(after Downs, 2000) unspecified differences from <i>Coelophysis
rhodesiensis</i> in cervical length, proximal and distal hindlimb
proportions and proximal caudal vertebral anatomy.<br>
(after Tykoski and Rowe, 2004) differs from <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>
and <i>"Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i> in lacking pit at the base of the
nasal process of the premaxilla.<br>
(after Bristowe and Raath, 2004) differs from <i>Coelophysis
rhodesiensis</i> in having a longer maxillary tooth row;
anteroposterior length of ventral lacrimal process &gt;30% of its
height.<br>
(after Ezcurra, 2007) absence of an offset rostral process of the
maxilla; strongly caudally bowed quadrate; small external mandibular
fenestra (9-10% of mandibular length) (also in <i>Dilophosaurus</i>).
Differs from <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> in having a square-shaped
rostral process of the jugal; unreduced medial condyle of the distal
trochlea of the metacarpal I.<br>
(after Barta, Nesbitt and Norell, 2018) differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis rhodesiensis</span> in lacking
a pisiform; metacarpal V present.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Cope (1887a) originally diagnosed <i>Coelurus
bauri</i> based on several characters. Posterior pleurocoels in the
cervical centra are present in all coelophysoids, including the <i>longicollis</i>
type. The dorsal longitudinal grooves on the anterior cervical neural
arch (alongside the neural spine) are present in other coelophysoids as
well. The smaller size than <i>longicollis</i> is within the range of
ontogenetic or individual variation. The femur is said to be "not so
strongly grooved at the third [=fourth] trochanteric ridge", but this
specimen (AMNH 2725) has been reassigned to a shuvosaurid by Nesbitt et
al. (2007).<br>
Cope (1889) erected <i>Coelophysis</i> because the vertebrae have
neural canals, which he did not believe were present in <i>Tanystropheus</i>.
Besides being primitive, this is untrue for <i>Tanystropheus</i>. In
addition, Cope noted the amphicoelous cervicals differed from <i>Coelurus</i>
(though the opisthocoelous cervicals assigned to <i>Coelurus</i> by
Marsh have since been removed) and the lack of an ectocondylar tuber on
the femur differed from <i>Megadactylus</i> (=<i>Anchisaurus</i>)
(though this was based on a silesaurid femur). <br>
Colbert (1964) listed numerous characters in his diagnosis of <i>Coelophysis</i>,
most of which are primitive for neotheropods- lightly built; hollow
bones; skull narrow; teeth laterally compressed and serrated;
amphicoelous vertebrae; ten cervical vertebrae; thirteen dorsal
vertebrae; five sacral vertebrae; sacral vertebrae fused; distal
caudals elongate; forelimb ~50% of hindlimb length; carpals present;
manual digit IV reduced; elongate ilium; pubis anteroposteriorly
flattened; pubic boot; ischium rod-like; ischium proximally expanded.
Some are not true in <i>Coelophysis</i>- pubis equal or longer than
femur. [entry in progress] <br>
<b>Original <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span></b><span style="font-style: italic;">-</span> The original type material was
discovered in 1881 at Arroyo Seco and described by Cope (1887a) as <i>Coelurus
bauri</i> and<i> C. longicollis</i>, though they were referred to that
genus without justification.  Cope later (1887b) referred these to
<i>Tanystropheus</i> instead, along with a third species from the same
collection- <i>T. willistoni</i>. He felt the amphicoelous cervicals
of his material were more similar to the amphicoelous vertebrae of <i>Tanystropheus</i>
(then thought to be caudals) than the supposedly opisthocoelous
cervicals of <i>Coelurus</i> (based on vertebrae now removed from that
taxon- YPM 1996 and 1997).  In 1889, Cope separated the three
species from <i>Tanystropheus</i> as his new genus <i>Coelophysis</i>
because the vertebrae have neural canals, although that is also true in
the former genus.  Huene (1906, 1915) illustrated the material and
described it in more depth, but because of the numerous complete
skeletons discovered at the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry in 1947, the Arroyo Seco fragments were largely ignored until
the 1980s.<br>
<b>Ghost Ranch</b>- On June 22 1947 an extensive bonebed of
coelophysids was discovered at Ghost Ranch (later specified as the
Whitaker Quarry or <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry in 1989 to distinguish it from the Canjilon Quarry also near
Ghost Ranch, with <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry being the term generally used today) and were assigned to <i>Coelophysis</i>
by Colbert (1947) in a popular article. Colbert and Baird later (1958)
assigned the Ghost Ranch specimens specifically to <i>C. bauri</i>,
which Colbert (1964) explained was due to his believing <i>C.
longicollis</i> and <i>C. willistoni</i> were older and younger
individuals respectively of the same species. Padian (1986) first
articulated the issue that the Arroyo Seco elements
were less diagnostic than associated skeletons like UCMP 129618 found
in 1982 or the numerous <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry skeletons. 
Hunt and Lucas (1991) attempted to solve this by naming the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> Quarry specimens <span style="font-style: italic;">Rioarribasaurus colberti</span>, but the
ICZN (1996) ruled that a <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
Quarry specimen (AMNH 7224) is the neotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>, leaving the
Arroyo Seco specimens as not definitely <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>. 
These Arroyo Seco specimens, the Petrified Forest theropod (UCMP 129618
plus a few referred specimens), the Snyder Quarry coelophysid (assigned
to <span style="font-style: italic;">C. bauri </span>by Spielmann et
al., 2007), and other Late Triassic American material may be referrable
to <i>C. bauri</i> or at least <i>Coelophysis</i>, but this cannot be
determined until the Ghost Ranch specimens are redescribed (although
the consensus is <span style="font-style: italic;">Lepidus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Camposaurus</span>- possibly including the
Hayden Quarry material, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gojirasaurus</span>
are all distinct). The illustrations of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span> in Colbert (1989)
are inaccurate and have hampered comparison to other coelophysids.
Downs (2000) notes most of the supposed differences from <i>C.
rhodesiensis</i> are not real (both have a vaulted palate; interdental
plates; obturator fenestra; pubic fenestra; fused pelvis; triangular
dorsal transverse processes; identical hindlimb morphology; the
supposed nasal fenestra of <span style="font-style: italic;">rhodesiensis</span>
is just the standard saurischian posterolateral nasal process also
known in <i>bauri</i>). Tykoski (2005) notes the presence of a median
basisphenoid spur that follows the roof of the basisphenoid recess
cannot be ascertained in <i>Coelophysis</i>
(contra Tykoski and Rowe, 2004). Ezcurra (2006) noted that contra
Bristowe and Raath (2004), an anteriorly pointed antorbital fossa only
occurs in some adult specimens (e.g. CM C-3-82, AMNH 7224, YPM 41196),
but not others (e.g. AMNH 7240, MCZ 4327). It is thus not a diagnostic
character of the species.  Wang et al. (2017) "noted a high degree
of polymorphism in skeletons from that quarry traditionally referred to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>,
even considering ontogenetic variation" and suggested "there may be
additional basal theropod taxa represented by material from Ghost Ranch
(possibly <span style="font-style: italic;">Daemonosaurus</span>)." 
Barta et al. (2018) noted that for the
carpus "the main variable characters within the Ghost Ranch specimens
of <span style="font-style: italic;">C. bauri</span>
are the separation or fusion of the intermedium and ulnare (or
alternatively the presence or absence of an intermedium altogether),
presence or absence of an ossified centrale, and the degree of fusion
among the distal carpals."<br>
The manus of AMNH 30631 was first photographed by Xu et al. (2009)
without a specimen number as figure S3b.  It was later described
and illustrated in detail by Barta et al. (2018), who stated it "is
from a smaller block (#36) from the 1947 excavation of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> Quarry" and "was found
with much of a foot, but this manus and pes cannot be connected to any
other individual in the quarry."<br>
Note YPM 5705, listed by Galton (1971) in Table 2 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>, is a cast of the
neotype AMNH 7224 (YPM online).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Supposed </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Eucoelophysis</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> TMP 1984.063.0033</span>- Rinehart et al.
(2009) refer a partial skeleton from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> Quarry (TMP
1984.063.0033) to <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis</span>. 
The authors list several characters supposedly showing this isn't
<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span> unlike the
other thirty-three dinosaurs in the
block.  Four sacrals are reported, with the last not fused to the
others.  "The distal scapula is less rounded and the middle shaft
portion is distinctly wider than in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>", but
<span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis</span> has a scapular
blade which is narrower than <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>. 
The transverse proximal femoral groove is also present in coelophysids
(e.g. UCMP 129618), while the anterior trochanter was said to be very
similar to gracile <span style="font-style: italic;">rhodesiensis</span>
so would be expected in a gracile
<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>. 
Rinehart et al. state "A small, sharp, distinct,
crest-like anterolateral trochanter is located immediately anterior to
the greater trochanter on the anterior surface of the femur head as is
seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis baldwini</span>
(Fig. 42E-F). This trochanter is unique,
and we consider it to be the single most diagnostic feature in our
assignment of TMP84-63-33 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis</span>." 
Yet this is merely the
dorsolateral trochanter, common in dinosauriforms including <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span> itself (Nesbitt, 2011).   The authors also say
"The tibia
shows an appressed tibia surface (a wide, shallow sulcus to accommodate
the fibular shaft) as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eucoelophysis
baldwini</span>", which would count
against a neotheropod identity if true.  Finally, TMP
1984.063.0033 is said
to have distal tarsals "that are very much more robust than any
observed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>",
but distal tarsal IV is described as
22% as thick as transversely wide while that of UCMP 129618 is
42%. 
Thus the only potentially valid suggested differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>
are one less fused sacral, the broader and more angled scapula, and the
absent fibular crest on the tibia, none of which are clearly
figured.  If these are true, referral to the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Daemonosaurus</span>
is possible if that taxon is a neotheropod based on the cervical
pleurocoels, confluent supracetabular crest and brevis ridge, fused
astragalocalcaneum, "attenuated first digit [of the pes], and the fifth
metatarsal ... reduced to a thin splint of bone."  However these
characters (except for the pleurocoels) along with the elongate dorsal
centra, long postacetabular process, deep brevis fossa and small pubic
boot are incompatable with a herrerasaur, which <span style="font-style: italic;">Daemonosaurus</span>
has recently been argued to be.  It seems most likely given the
similarity to coelophysoid-grade taxa that this is merely a
misinterpreted <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
specimen.<br>
<b>Cannibalism in <i>Coelophysis</i>?</b>- AMNH 7223 and 7224 are
preserved with supposed stomach contents (vertebrae and a hindlimb in
7223; articulated remains anteriorly, plus a sacral vertebra, ilium and
proximal femora posteriorly in 7224) that have been traditionally
viewed as evidence of cannibalism (e.g. Colbert, 1989). However, the
supposed stomach contents of AMNH 7223 don't lie within the ribcage,
and those in the anterior of 7224 lie under the ribcage (Gay, 2002;
Nesbitt et al., 2006). The posterior fragments in AMNH 7224 are within
the ribcage, but are crocodylomorph, not theropod (Nesbitt et al.,
2006). The supposedly cannibalized manual elements identified in
coprolites and cololites by Rinehart et al. (2005) cannot be identified
as <i>Coelophysis</i> (Nesbitt et al., 2006). There is thus no
evidence of cannibalism in <i>Coelophysis</i>. <br>
<b>Not <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span></b><span style="font-style: italic;">-</span> Colbert and Baird (1958) referred
BSNH 13656 from the Portland Formation of Connecticut to <i>Coelophysis</i>
sp., but these were later referred to <i>holyokensis</i> by Colbert
(1964). Several authors (Gregory, 1945; Elder, 1978, 1987) assigned
material from the Colorado City Member of the Dockum Formation in Texas
to <i>Coelophysis</i>, but these are <i>Trilophosaurus</i> (Hunt et
al., 1998). The centra from "Lot's Wife" (actually Agate Bridge N) of
the Sonsela Member of the Chinle Formation of Arizona referred to <i>Coelophysis</i>
by Colbert (1989) are Archosauromorpha indet. (Parker and Irmis,
2005).  Sullivan (1994) reported "indeterminate ceratosaur fossils
which are considered topotypic material of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>"
found in 1993 from five sites around Arroyo Seco.  Sullivan et al.
(1996) published the specimens and localities, again proposing them as
topotypes for <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>. 
These are undescribed with only SMP VP-487 figured, and are probably
indeterminate at levels between Coelophysidae and Archosauria.<br>

which was tentatively reidentified as <i>Dracovenator</i> by Yates
(2005). Bristowe and Raath (2004) used a partially articulated juvenile
skull to show the nasal fenestra identified by Raath (1977) was in fact
closed in life, Raath articulated the palatine backwards, and that his
reconstruction of the lacrimal-jugal articulation is inaccurate. They
also confirmed the hyoids identified by Raath were furculae.<br>

(from Carrano et al., 2005) rectangular humeral deltopectoral crest.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Segisaurus</i> has been reprepared, showing a
furcula in articulation with the coracoids (not separate clavicles) and
thin-walled long bones.<br>
Although Carrano et al. (2005) could not recover any resolution within
Coelophysoidea in their cladistic analysis, when several characters are
changed to ordered, the results differ. If a standard coelophysoid
topology of (<i>Dilophosaurus</i> (<i>Liliensternus</i> <i>,Coelophysis</i>))
is enforced, <i>Segisaurus</i> is placed outside the <i>Liliensternus</i>
+ <i>Coelophysis</i> clade. This differs from Rauhut's (2000)
findings, which placed it in the Coelophysidae.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Nesbitt and Stocker
(2008) figure three specimens found in 1934 or 1935
and refer them to Theropoda.  MCZ 3038 is a metatarsal II stated
to be "identical to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis
bauri</span>
and other early theropods, and fragments of an identical metatarsal II
(part of UCMP 152645) were found at the Canjilon Quarry. However, no
unique character states are shared between MCZ 3038 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis bauri</span>
exclusive of other theropods."  MCZ 3039 is a cervical with
anterior and posterior pleurocoels, leading the authors to say that
this "clearly indicates that the cervical can be assigned to a
theropod, and more specifically, a coelophysoid", but more recent
phylogenies place some taxa with double pleurocoels such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
outside Coelophysoidea.  Finally, the distal femur MCZ 4779 is
said to have "a short, posteriorly pointed crista tibiofibularis, a
cleft separating the crista tibiofibularis from the lateral condyle of
the femur and a gently rounded lateral condyle of the femur. All of
these character states are present in early theropods as well as other
basal saurischians and are not diagnostic to a specific taxon." 
More specifically, the obtuse angle between the lateral condyle and
crista tibiofibularis and the groove running posterolaterally into it
are saurischian characters.  Comparing it to non-averostran
neotheropods, it is most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zupaysaurus</span>
based on the lack of an extensor groove and short transverse width
compared to anteroposterior depth.  The proximal outline of
metatarsal
II is also more similar <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>,
differing from the more semicircular shape of coelophysids or the short
anterior edge with rounded anterolateral corner of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>.  <br>

incomplete tibia <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Collected in 1992,
Benton et al. (1995) described this as a theropod based on the "fibula
closely appressed to tibia and attached to a tibial crest" and
"thin-walled, hollow, long bones", and probably a ceratosaur (sensu
lato) based on its age and sharing a "straight tibia with a broad
proximal end, priminent cnemial crest, and sharp fibular facet" with <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span>. 
As noted by Carrano and Sampson (2004), Benton et al. misidentified
this distal left tibia as a proximal right tibia.  Thus the
fibular crest is unpreserved and the feature Benton et al. described is
only a sharp lateral edge to the shaft, while their cnemial crest is
the proximomedial buttress.  Ironically, it is still very similar
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> so was
correctly identified for mostly incorrect reasons, as Carrano and
Sampson concluded it "cannot be identified more specifically than
Coelophysoidea indet.."  The distal outline appears more similar
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Zupaysaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelophysis</span> based on the longer

<b>Material</b>-
(NMMNH P4569; Bull Canyon neotheropod) (subadult) incomplete atlantal
intercentrum, partial anterior cervical epipophysis, two cervical
central fragments, cervical rib tuberculum, dorsal centrum, two dorsal
prezygapophyses, two dorsal transverse processes, four dorsal rib
tubercula, five dorsal rib capitula, partial proximal caudal centrum,
partial distal caudal centrum, fourteen partial dorsal or caudal
centra, many dorsal or caudal central fragments, apical
dorsal/sacral/caudal neural spine, left scapular fragment, two distal
right manual phalanges, proximal manual ungual, right ilial pubic
peduncle, right ilial supracetabular crest, proximal right ischial
fragment, proximal left femur (65.41 mm wide trans), distal left tibia,
distal left fibula, partial left astragalocalcaneum, distal right
metatarsal II, distal left metatarsal IV, incomplete pedal phalanx
II/III-1, proximal phalanx II/III-1, phalanx IV-4, three proximal
?pedal phalanges, distal pedal phalanx<br>
<b>Comments</b>- NMMNH P4569 was originally seen as a coelophysoid by
Lucas et al. (1985) and Hunt and Lucas (1989), though Murry and Long
(1989) and Long and Murry (1995) referred it to Sauropodomorpha. Hunt
(1994) named this "Comanchesaurus kuesi" in his unpublished thesis,
assigning it to Herrerasauridae. It was called herrerasaurid B by Hunt
et al. (1998). Nesbitt et al. (2007) confirmed a saurischian identity
based on the dorsal astragalar basin, but noted the astragalar
morphology was closer to coelophysids than to <i>Herrerasaurus</i> or other taxa. Griffin (2019) described the specimen in detail as
"Neotheropoda genus indeterminate species indeterminate", placing it in
the clade due to astraglocalcanear fusion and the presence of a ridge
on the proximomedial fibula. He added it to a version of Nesbitt et al.'s dinosauromorph matrix and recovered it in a polytomy with <em>Gojirasaurus</em>, <em>Liliensternus</em>, <em>Zupaysaurus</em> and more derived theropods.<br>
Nesbitt et al. further noted the fragmentary remains referred to
"Comanchesaurus" are indeterminate.<br>
Although the name "Comanchesaurus kuesi" was originally used in thesis,
and thus not available for use in this website, it was later published
by Nesbitt et al. (2007). <br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (UCM 47221; in part) (5.5 m) pubis (497 mm), tibia
(469 mm), metatarsal V (105 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Nesbitt et al., 2005) more robust tibia than <i>Coelophysis
bauri</i>.<br>
(after Griffin, 2019) differs from <em>Coelophysis? rhodesiensis</em> in- raised scar on  anterior surface of metatarsal V; absence of sulcus on  proximomedial surface of metatarsal V.<br>
differs 
from <em>Dilophosaurus</em> in- non-convex surface between lateral and anteromedial tubera of metatarsal V in proximal view. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was originally briefly described and
illustrated as Procompsognathidae gen. et sp. indet. by Parrish and
Carpenter (1986). It was then described and named "Revueltoraptor
lucasi" by Hunt (1994) in his unpublished thesis, and called
herrerasaurid A by Hunt et al. (1998). It was finally officially named
and described as the coelophysoid <i>Gojirasaurus quayi</i> by
Carpenter (1997). However, Nesbitt et al. (2005) find the holotype to
be chimaeric, which was elaborated on in their 2007 publication. They
found the dorsal vertebrae were referrable to <i>Shuvosaurus</i> and
the pubis and tibia referrable to a coelophysoid (contra the 2005
abstract where the dinosaurian elements were relegated to Saurischia
indet.). They could not assign the other material (teeth, dorsal ribs,
gastralia, chevron) or the several referred specimens noted by Hunt
(1994) (NMMNH P4666, P16607, P16656, P16946, P17134, P17154, P17258,
UMMP 7274) to a particular taxon of archosaur. The reassignment of the
dorsal material makes the sole apomorphy identified by Rauhut invalid
(mid/posterior dorsal vertebrae with taller neural spines than other
coelophysoids), and <i>Gojirasaurus</i> is presently indeterminate
relative to <i>Coelophysis</i> except for the greater robustness of the tibia (Nesbitt et al., 2007).
This may be size-related.  Griffin (2019) described the previously
unrecognized metatarsal V (which is clearly not the robust element of a shuvosaurid) and did find that element distinguishable from <em>Coelophysis? rhodesiensis</em> and <em>Dilophosaurus</em>.<br>
Although the name "Revueltoraptor lucasi" was originally used in
thesis, and thus not available for use in this website, it was later
published by Nesbitt et al. (2007). The name was first noted publically
on the Dinosaur Mailing List in 2000 by Gay, who noted several elements
at the NMMNH were labeled as "Revueltoraptor". These were specimens
referred to the taxon by Hunt (1994), and are not identifiable as <i>Gojirasaurus</i>. <br>
Rauhut (2003) suggested <i>Gojirasaurus</i> may be synonymous with <i>Shuvosaurus</i>,
as a large <i>Shuvosaurus</i> premaxilla was found in the same
deposits (identified as Reptilia indet. by Parrish and Carpenter,
1986), and the tooth associated with the <i>Gojirasaurus</i> holotype
may not belong to it. However, Nesbitt and Norell (2006) have
demonstrated that <i>Shuvosaurus</i> is a pseudosuchian whose pubis
and tibia differ markedly from <i>Gojirasaurus</i>'.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Hunt (1994) and Hunt et al. (1998) referred this
specimen to Herrerasauridae based on the short dorsal centra,
strap-like scapula and elongate pubis. However, the dorsals are now
assigned to <i>Shuvosaurus</i>, the scapula is Archosauria indet., and
all theropods have elongate pubes. Parrish and Carpenter (1986)
believed the taxon to be most closely related to <i>Liliensternus</i> within their Procompsognathidae, in which they included all
coelophysoids. Carpenter (1997) concurred regarding the similarity to <i>Liliensternus</i>,
referring it to Coelophysoidea and possibly Coelophysidae. Rauhut's
analysis (2003) found <i>Gojirasaurus</i> to be a coelophysoid more
closely related to coelophysids than to <i>Liliensternus</i>. Yates'
(2005) updated version of Rauhut's analysis found <i>Gojirasaurus</i> to be in a polytomy with <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>, <i>"M."
kayentakatae</i> and <i>Segisaurus</i>, more derived than <i>Coelophysis
bauri</i>. Tykoski and Rowe (2004) could only say that <i>Gojirasaurus</i> was a coelophysoid more derived than <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, which was
also the result of Carrano et al.'s (2005) analysis. Tykoski (2005)
could find even less resolution, with <i>Gojirasaurus</i> having an
uncertain position within Coelophysoidea, though in a polytomy with <i>Zupaysaurus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Coelophysis</i> in the majority rule tree.
Ezcurra and Novas (2007) found it to be the sister taxon of <i>"Syntarsus"
kayentakatae</i>, outside Coelophysinae. However, all of these analyses
included <i>Shuvosaurus</i> and Archosauria indet. remains in their <i>Gojirasaurus</i> OTUs, as they were published prior to Nesbitt et al.'s reanalysis of
the holotype. Thus any particular placement within Coelophysoidea is
questionable, and must be reexamined to determine if it was based on
pubic or tibial characters. Ezcurra (2012) found <i>Gojirasaurus</i> to
be a non-coelophysid coelophysoid sensu stricto in a large unpublished
analysis. Griffin (2019) added it to a version of Nesbitt et al.'s dinosauromorph matrix and recovered it in a polytomy with &quot;Comanchesaurus&quot;, <em>Liliensternus</em>, <em>Zupaysaurus</em> and more derived theropods.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut, 2000) one pair of pleurocoels in the
cervical vertebrae, less developed infradiapophyseal fossa; the absence
of a horizontal ridge at the basis of the cervical neural spines;
absence of a lateral bulge on the ilium.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The syntypes were discovered in 1932. Huene (1932)
assumed nine cervicals and fourteen dorsals as compared to the modern
neotheropod default of ten cervicals and thirteen dorsals. He also only
identified three sacrals, but comparison to <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
indicates his first caudal is a fourth sacral (based on the expanded
transverse processes), and his second caudal would then be a fifth
sacral. The metacarpals III and IV of Huene are II and III based on
comparison to <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, which results in all of the manual
material being from the next medial digit than Huene's identification
(e.g. supposed proximal metacarpal V is metacarpal IV).  The
syntype remains of this species are usually referred to two
individuals. However, the material was found disarticulated and may
represent more than two individuals. Because of this and the fact it is
hard to separate the remains belonging to the various individuals,
Rauhut and Hungerbuhler (2000) recommend retaining all of the material
as the syntypes of <i>Liliensternus</i> (contra Welles 1984, who made
the larger individual the lectotype). Because the neurocentral sutures
are unfused and only two fused sacrals are present, the remains are
probably juveniles or subadults. Contra Rowe and Gauthier (1990), the
pubis encloses a complete obturator foramen, not just a notch.<br>
The UA coll. metatarsal was originally a syntype of <i>Plateosaurus
engelhardti</i>, described as a manual or pedal element by Meyer (1855)
and a pubic fragment by Huene (1908). It was reidentified as a proximal
metatarsal IV "of a theropod dinosaur such as the ceratosaurian <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus liliensterni</span>" by
Galton (2000) and a proximal metatarsal II of cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus sp.</span> by Moser (2003).
Comparison with figures of <i>Liliensternus</i> indicates Moser is
correct, who also stated it is "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">the same size and
shape, if not completely identical" to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span>  He further notes the
element is missing from the UA collections.<br>
Jaekel (1914) reported Fund. Nr. IV as a small dinosaur with
theropod-type teeth (ziphodont and finely serrated) and postcrania
consisting of "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">a
femur, an os pubis, an ilium, several vertebrae of the sacral and tail
region."  Sander (1992) mentioned it as "theropod postcranial
remains
which were briefly described by Jaekel (1914a, p. 195) as indeterminate
carnosaur" which he "listed as pertaining to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>."  However,
Huene (1932) described the postcrania as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Palaeosaurus</span> (?) sp. (aff. <span style="font-style: italic;">diagnosticus</span>),
which by that time consisted only of a posterior dorsal centrum, two
partial distal caudal vertebrae, a partial ilium and incomplete
pubis. 
It shows the squared postacetabular process and hypertrophied
semilunate pubic tubercle Yates found diagnostic of <span style="font-style: italic;">Efraasia minor</span>,
so is here referred to that taxon.  It is unknown whether the
theropod
teeth were lost or recatalogued.  Jaekel also noted "several [<span style="font-style: italic;">Plateosaurus</span>]
skeletons were accompanied by broken-off tooth crowns of carnosaurs",
but these teeth remain undescribed.  Sander referred <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterospondylus</span> from these same
deposits to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span> as
well, but as noted by Rauhut and Hungerbuhler "the transverse processes
in ... <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span> are less
strongly backturned and not as significantly triangular" as <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterospondylus</span>.  </span><br>
Kuhn (1939) referred several elements to <span style="font-style: italic;">Halticosaurus</span> aff. <span style="font-style: italic;">liliensterni</span> (MHH coll.), saying "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">the
find to be described here originally originally consisted of a more or
less complete skeleton, of which only a few parts had to be recovered"
[translated].  He stated the mid caudal centrum "</span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">is suitable for
identification with <span style="font-style: italic;">Halticosaurus</span>",
the tibia is less bowed anteriorly and with a somewhat smaller
tuberosity (lateral condyle?), while the metatarsals and phalanges "</span><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">cannot be distinguished
from <span style="font-style: italic;">Halticosaurus liliensterni</span>." 
The tibia's proximal diameters are 16x9 mm compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>' 95x55 mm, while the
caudal is 14 mm long compared to ~53 mm.  Thus it is much smaller,
even moreso that the co-occuring <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterospondylus</span>,
and might be a juvenile or wrongly referred.</span><br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered from
2008-2012, Sulej et al. (2012) referred the pelvis ZPAL V.39.33 to
Coelophysoidea indet., and additionally stated the lack of confluence
between the supracetabular crest and brevis shelf was shared with <i>Liliensternus</i>. 
However, Niedzwiedzki et al. (2014) redescribed it as Theropoda indet.,
finding the condition is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Tawa</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lophostropheus</span> or
coelophysids.  They also found the notch below the postacetabular
process "is most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Lophostropheus</span>,
both of which possess deep notches that, like in ZPAL V.39/33, result
from the large size of the ischial peduncle and its posterior expansion
at its distal tip."  Indeed, no differences were noted from <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span> except the presence
of fusion when the specimen is about 1.2 times smaller.<br>
Sulej et al. also referred partial scapulocoracoid ZPAL V.39/35 to
Coelophysoidea, but it was placed in Herrerasauridae by Niedzwiedzki et
al. (2014) once described.  Similarly, Sulej et al. assigned teeth
ZPAL
V.39/37, caudal vertebrae ZPAL V.39/38 and pedal unguals ZPAL V.39/36
to Coelophysoidea indet., but Niedzwiedzki et al. reported they "do not
preserve any clear neotheropod (or dinosaur or dinosauriform) character
states; this material is not described in this article and will be the
subject of future study."  They are placed in Archosauriformes

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Zahner and
Brinkmann, 2019) four exceptionally long but slender premaxillary tooth
crowns (as long as anterior maxillary teeth but mesiodistally less
wide- ratio 3/1 versus 2.4/1); premaxillary tooth crowns labiolingually
flattened, mesially somewhat broader than distally and with fine
serrations along their mesial and distal carinae (5 per 1 mm);
promaxillary foramen and maxillary fossa present; supratemporal fossa
restricted to posterior half of parietal; shallow basisphenoid recess;
exit of vagus nerve (X) through a posterior foramen lateral to foramina
for hypoglossal nerve (XII); three distinct processes of the articular
(medial, dorsolateral and dorsal); markedly low rectangular posterior
dorsal neural spines (ratio 2/1); posteriorly increasing height of
dorsal neural spines; flattened ventral surfaces and expanded articular
faces of sacral centra; deep fossa on lateral surface of second sacral
vertebra; proximal caudals with longitudinal fossae on centra and
neural arches; prominent anteroproximally located tubercular processes
on first four chevrons; pronounced pubic and ischial boots, ischial
boot larger than pubic boot.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype
postcrania was discovered in spring 2006, but the skull was only found
in 2009.  Different portions of the skeleton were described in
three theses (Hugi, 2008; Unterrassner, 2009; Zahner, 2014), while
Mallison (online 2012) reported on and photographed the specimen as the
Frickopod.  Oettl-Rieser and Zahner (2018) discussed this as the
Frick theropod before Zahner and Brinkmann (2019) officially described
and named it.  They used a novel phylogenetic analysis to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span> closer to
averostrans than coelophysids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zupaysaurus</span>, but further
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Dracoraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryolophosaurus</span>. 
Interestingly, their figure 1i apparently shows the large slab prior to
final preparation as photographed by Mallison seven years earlier that
exposed the dorsal column.  Perhaps it was taken from Hugi's
thesis.<br>
Tooth MSF 24 was found in 1985 associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">Plateosaurus</span>
skeleton MSF 23, while "about 15 isolated rootless theropod teeth were
found during the 1988 excavation" (MSF coll. including MSF 30-33)
associated with other <span style="font-style: italic;">Plateosaurus</span>
skeletons (1988/1, 1988/2 and/or 1988/3) (Sander, 1992).  Sander
referred these to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
based on the high DSDI (~1.08), which he compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">kayentakatae</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lophostropheus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>, "the teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus liliensternii</span>" being
"generally similar in shape, size, and density of serration."  <span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span> is very similar
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span>
and from the same locality, though its lateral tooth morphology remains
unpublished.  The teeth are thus provisionally referred to it,
pending publication of Zahner's thesis.<br>
In mid May 2017 a theropod skeleton was discovered in the same layer as
the isolated teeth (Anonymous, 2017), the published hindlimb photo of
which shows is neotheropod. The ilium is similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span>,
and all but the hindlimb should be eventually comparable.  The
article says this may be a new taxon, but it is provisionally listed
here given the coelophysoid-grade morphology and proximity to <span style="font-style: italic;">Notatessaraeraptor</span>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Andrews, 1921) subpreacetabular notch
extremely acute.<br>
(after
Ezcurra et al., 2021) ilium with a slightly posteriorly projecting
ischiadic peduncle; ilium without laterally exposed ventromedial margin
of the brevis fossa except for a short portion of its base (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryolophosaurus</span>);
ilium with a poorly transversely expanded brevis fossa (also in other
non-coelophysoid neotheropods); femur with dorsolateral trochanter
(also in other non-averostran neotheropods); fourth trochanter poorly
posteriorly expanded (also present in coelophysoids and early
ceratosaurians); femur without an extensor groove; tibia with fibular
crest that reaches posterior lateral condyle; tibia with
anteroposterior depth versus mediolateral width ratio ≥ 0.6; tibia with
anteroposteriorly narrow facet for reception of the ascending process
of the astragalus; tibia with an angle between the main axis of the
lateral half of the facet for reception of the ascending process of the
astragalus and the longitudinal axis of the bone ≥ 25 degrees in
anterior view; tibia with a proximally well-extended posteromedial
notch on the distal end; tibia with a poorly projected medial
malleolus; fibula with a poorly projected and tab-like posterior margin
of the proximal end in lateral view.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Andrews (1921) also distinguished <i>Sarcosaurus</i>
from <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i>
by its small conical anterior trochanter, but this is plesiomorphic.<br>
Paul (1988) stated the more proximally placed "outer ridge" (=
trochanteric shelf?) on the femur distinguished it from <i>Ceratosaurus</i>,
but this does not appear to be true.<br>
Carrano and Sampson (2004) claimed <i>Sarcosaurus</i> is undiagnostic,
but Ezcurra et al. (2021) confirmed "the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus woodi</span> to be diagnosable
using a unique combination of character states."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">andrewsi</span>-
The tibia NHMUK R3542 was originally described by Woodward (1908) as a
megalosaurian whose slenderness "and the trochlear shape of the facette
for the astragalus, suggest a lighter and more active reptile than the
ordinary Megalosaurians", but left it unnamed as "the tibia alone is
insufficient for a more exact determination of its affinities." 
It was then accidentally made the type of two species simultaneously by
Huene (1932), <span style="font-style: italic;">Magnosaurus woodwardi</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus andrewsi</span>. 
Huene also lists <i>Megalosaurus woodwardi</i> in the section on <i>Magnosaurus
nethercombensis</i>, stating both should be <i>Megalosaurus</i>
subgenus <i>Magnosaurus</i>. As <i>Magnosaurus</i> is explicitly
named as a new genus on that same page, this was probably an earlier
opinion that was mistakenly retained.  Huene (1956) ended up
calling it <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus andrewsi</span>,
making him first reviewer and establishing the correct name. 
Carrano and Sampson (2004) found it to be indistinguishable from the
referred specimen of <i>Sarcosaurus woodi</i> except for size, and
suggested the two species might be synonyms.  This was formalized
by Ezcurra et al. (2021).<br>
<b>"Liassaurus"</b>- In 1927, Huene was informed of a theropod partial
skeleton in the Warwick Museum which he later described (1932) as a
specimen of <i>Sarcosaurus woodi</i>. 
The supposed distal pubis is actually a proximal fibula (Ezcurra et
al., 2021). Carrano and Sampson (2004) referred to the skeleton as cf. <i>Sarcosaurus
woodi</i>, seemingly depending on Huene's description. While both Huene
and Carrano and Sampson noted similarity between the Warwick specimen
and the <i>woodi</i> holotype, neither provided synapomorphies to
support such a referral. Pickering (1995) listed the name <i>Liassaurus
huenei</i> in an unpublished bibliographic work, credited to Welles,
Powell and Pickering. This is a nomen nudum however, as he didn't
follow ICZN Article 8.1.3- it must have been produced in an edition
containing simultaneously obtainable copies by a method that assures
numerous identical and durable copies. He later (Welles and Pickering,
1999) referred to it as an unnamed Liassic theropod in the comparative
section of an unpublished <i>Megalosaurus</i> redescription. It is
presumably one of the theropods to be redescribed by Welles and Powell
in their unpublished study from the 1970's, which Pickering intends to
publish as Mutanda Dinosaurologica. Pickering posted his diagnosis for
"Liassaurus" on a private newsgroup in 2005, of which only the absent
trochanteric shelf was different from <i>Sarcosaurus</i>. 
As this latter character varies dimorphically in ceratosaur-grade
theropods, it is not seen as taxonomically significant.  Ezcurra
et al. redescribed the specimen and referred it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus woodi</span>
based on "the unique combination of a proportionally short
middle-posterior dorsal centrum (length - anterior height ratio &lt; 2,
also present in non-coelophysid theropods) and femur with a low fourth
trochanter (also present in coelophysids and early ceratosaurian
averostrans) and with a dorsolateral trochanter on the proximal end
(also present in non-averostran theropods)."<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Andrews (1921) originally assigned <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus</span> to the Megalosauridae,
in which he included not only basal tetanurines, but also <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
and carnosaurs. Specifically, Andrews felt the ilium was similar to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
and <i>Megalosaurus</i>, while the anterior trochanter was more
primitive than <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i>Ceratosaurus</i>,
though closest to the latter. An assignment to such a broad
Megalosauridae was standard throughout the 1900s. Kurzanov (1989)
referred it to his more restricted concept of Megalosauridae
(containing <i>Megalosaurus</i> and sinraptorids) without comment.
Huene (1932) placed it in Coeluridae based on similarity to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span> (now recognized as a
ceratosaur), but in 1956 referred it to his incorrectly formed family
Coelurosauridae. Gauthier (1986) recognized <i>Sarcosaurus</i> as a
ceratosaur sensu lato on the basis of its trochanteric shelf, which was
followed by Rowe (1989). This was elaborated on by Rowe and Gauthier
(1990), who placed <i>Sarcosaurus</i> in Ceratosauria but outside
their unnamed equivalent of Coelophysidae based on the poorly defined
M. iliofemoralis fossa on the ilium and the lack of an obturator ridge
on the posterior femoral head. Paul (1988) referred <i>Sarcosaurus</i>
to the Ceratosauridae based on pelvic bones which are fused and "nearly
identical" in shape to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>. Welles (1984) was the
first to suggest coelophysoid relations, placing it in Coelophysidae
with <i>Coelophysis</i> (but not other currently recognized
coelophysoids) without comment. Carrano and Sampson (2004) described
characters shared with coelophysoids, such as long dorsal centra, an
anteriorly facing pubic peduncle, small, spike-like anterior
trochanter, and notched, circular distal tibia. They also noted
resemblence to <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, and
referred <i>Sarcosaurus</i> to Coelophysoidea. Tykoski (2005) notes
that <i>Sarcosaurus</i> has a mix of coelophysoid and ceratosaur sensu
stricto characters, and found it to be the most basal coelophysoid in
their analysis based on two characters- supracetabular crest flares
lateroventrally to hide dorsal acetabulum in lateral view; anterior
trochanter conical. Ezcurra (2012) found <i>Sarcosaurus</i> to be the
most basal ceratosaur in a large unpublished analysis. Most recently,
Ezcurra et al. (2021) used the Nesbitt dinosauromorph analysis to
recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Sarcosaurus</span> closer to
Averostra than <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>,
but less so than <span style="font-style: italic;">Tachiraptor</span>. 
Correcting some of the scorings moves it to a more basal position
closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Liliensternus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zupaysaurus</span>.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (PULR-076) (5-6 m) skull (450 mm), mandibles, atlas,
axis (110 mm), cervical vertebrae, cervical ribs, dorsal vertebrae,
sacral vertebrae, distal caudal vertebrae, proximal scapulocoracoid,
two proximal manual unguals, distal femora, proximal tibia, distal
tibia, distal fibula, astragalocalcaneum<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Arcucci and Coria, 2003) horizontal
ramus of the maxilla with parallel dorsal and ventral margins; tibia
with a very deep and caudally open notch for the reception of an
astragalar caudal process.<br>
(after Ezcurra, 2007) maxillary fenestra within the antorbital fossa
(also in Tetanurae); ventrally bowed rostral process of the lacrimal
(also in <i>Sinraptor</i>); kinked ventral process of the squamosal;
wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (also in several
tetanurines). <br>
(after Ezcurra and Novas, 2007) maxillary-jugal ventral margin
describing an obtuse angle in lateral view; notch on the dorsal margin
of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal ramus
of lacrimal rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the
ascending process of the maxilla; lacrimal with highly pneumatized
antorbital recess (also in Averostra); short and square-shaped
retroarticular process of the mandible; cnemial crest poorly developed.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The name "Zupaysaurus" was first announced on the
Discovery News television program on 11-12-1999, but was not published
until its official description in 2003.<br>
Originally thought to be "more derived than <i>Coelophysis</i>"
(Arcucci and Coria, 1997), and later a ceratosaur (Arcucci and Coria,
1998). When officially described by Arcucci and Coria (2003), it was
found to be a basal tetanurine. However, later analyses have found that
it is in fact a coelophysoid. Carrano et al. (2005) found it to be a
coelophysoid, but could not recover any resolution within that clade. <i>Zupaysaurus</i>
was found to be in a trichotomy with <i>Liliensternus</i> and
coelophysids by Tykoski (2005). Ezcurra and Novas (2005) agree the
taxon is a coelophysoid, which was elaborated on in Ezcurra and Novas
(2007). Of the supposed tetanurine characters, some are reinterpreted
as convergences (maxillary fenestra; lacrimal recess; fibula with
distal end expanded almost double the shaft width), while others aren't
present in <i>Zupaysaurus</i> (antorbital maxillary tooth row;
lacrimal horn; distal tibia transversely expanded) or are present in
coelophysoids as well (lateral temporal fenestra reduced and
key-hole-shaped; tibia with a posterolaterally concave distal end;
ascending process of astragalus anteriorly positioned). They found it
to be in a trichotomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Segisaurus</span>
and Coelophysidae. Smith et al. (2007) found <i>Zupaysaurus</i> to be
more derived than coelophysoids, sister to a clade containing
dilophosaurids, ceratosaurs and tetanurines. This was based on- tooth
row that ends at the anterior rim of the orbit (not actually present);
jugal with an expanded anterior end; lacrimal fenestra; broad contact
between the squamosal and quadratojugal; well-developed anterior wall
to the lateral mandibular glenoid; broadened retroarticular process;
posterodorsally facing surface for the attachment of the m. depressor
mandibulae on the retroarticular process; astragalar ascending process
that is higher than the astragalar body. Placing <i>Zupaysaurus</i>
inside Coelophysoidea took five more steps. The same position was found
in Ezcurra's (2012) large unpublished analysis. <br>

This specimen is currently under preparation and still requires
detailed study."  They figure it in posterior view as "mid-dorsal
vertebra from a coelophysoid theropod dinosaur."  Milner et al.
(2012) figure the vertebra in multiple views as "Theropod cranial
thoracic (anterior dorsal) vertebra (SGDS 768)", and it was later
described in detail by Marsh et al. (2021).  The latter study used
Nesbitt's dinosauromorph analysis to recover it as a member of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> + Averostra
clade.  Comparison to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>
suggests it is around the sixth dorsal based on parapophysis position,
neural spine shape in dorsal view and centrum shape in ventral view,
but it differs in having more transversely flared centrum ends and
retaining a ventral keel.  Notably this eliminates the supposed
difference of lacking a pleurocoel, since these are only present in the
first four dorsals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>.

two maxillary fragments, nine maxillary teeth, posterior skull,
posterior mandibles, sixth cervical central fragment, seventh cervical
vertebra (118 mm), eighth cervical vertebra (108 mm), ninth cervical

curving midline crest with fluted rostral and caudal surfaces formed by
dorsal expansions of the lacrimals; complete constriction across the
infratemporal fenestra formed by the squamosal and jugal; extremely

Smith et al. (2005) concluded this was a very basal tetanurine, but
their later published analysis (Smith et al., 2007) found <i>Cryolophosaurus</i>
to clade with <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>"D." sinensis</i> and <i>Dracovenator</i>
in a Dilophosauridae. Carrano et al. (2012) have since recovered it as
a non-orionidan tetanurine again, but only one more step removes it
from Averostra. Nine steps were needed to place it in Coelophysoidea
where they recovered <i>Dilophosaurus</i> however. As several other
relevent taxa were not included (e.g. <i>Zupaysaurus</i>, <i>Dracovenator</i>,
<i>Sarcosaurus</i>), this result is questionable.<br>

premaxillary posterodorsal process to a blade-like nasal crest;
extension of the antorbital fossa onto the<br>
lateroventral side of the nasal; presence of a nasolacrimal crest.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Although historically various taxa (<i>Liliensternus</i>,
<i>Halticosaurus</i>, etc.) have been proposed to be more closely
related to <i>Dilophosaurus</i> than to <i>Coelophysis</i> or
tetanurines (e.g. Welles, 1984; Paul, 1988), these were not supported
by phylogenetic analyses. The first analysis to recover such sister
taxa to <i>Dilophosaurus</i> was that of Yates (2005), which found a
clade containing <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Zupaysaurus</i> and <i>Dracovenator</i>
to be sister to Averostra. Smith et al. (2007) later found a clade
containing <i>"Dilophosaurus" sinensis (= Sinosaurus)</i>, <i>Dracovenator</i>,
<i>Cryolophosaurus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> (but not <i>Zupaysaurus</i>,
which was slightly more basal). <i>Zupaysaurus</i> has been assigned
to Coelophysidae in other recent analyses (Carrano et al., 2005;
Tykoski, 2005; Ezcurra and Novas, 2007) or sister to dilophosaurids
plus more derived theropods (Ezcurra, 2012). Smith et al.'s dilophosaur
clade was also sister to Averostra. Both Yates' and Smith et al.'s
analyses could place their dilophosaur clades in Coelophysoidea with
few added steps (1 in Yates; 6 in Smith et al.).<br>
Dilophosauridae was first used by Charig and Milner (1990) to refer to
Paul's (1988) informal dilophosaurs, which he actually used the
subfamiliy Halticosaurinae for (contra their quote). Since they did not
diagnose or define the family, it is a nomen nudum (ICZN Article
13.1.1). Madsen and Welles (2000) mention a Dilophosauridae used in the
same sense as Coelophysoidea. However, they then state Dilophosaurinae
should be a subfamily of Podokesauridae containing only <i>Dilophosaurus</i>.
Finally, they show an indented table with Dilophosauridae containing
only Dilophosaurinae, with <i>Dilophosaurus</i> its sole genus. This
table lists characters of Dilophosaurinae/idae, so this is the first
valid use of the family. <br>

Xu et al. (2009) illustrated metacarpal V in the holotype. Based on
Welles' (1984) description and the morphology in <i>Coelophysis</i>,
his radiale is distal carpal I, ulnare is distal carpal II, intermedium
is the radiale, 'second carpale' is distal carpal III, one of the other
ossicles is distal carpal IV, while the other may be an intermedium.<br>
Carrano et al. (2012) note that TMM 43646 differs from <i>D. wetherilli</i>
in a few characters (taller maxillary interdental places; pneumatic
fossa on the dorsal surface of the jugal process of the maxilla), and
excluded it from the hypodigm in their analysis.<br>
Marsh and Rowe (2020) reidentified several of the elements described by
Gay (2001)- proximal pubis MNA.V.101 is a proximal tibia; MNA.V.135 is
a cervical vertebra not a dorsal vertebra; MNA.V.177 is a caudal
vertebrae instead of a dorsal; pubis MNA.V.248 is a proximal tibia,
though that leaves a mystery where the rest of the element went as Gay
measures the whole thing as 570 mm; MNA.V.530 and 539 are proximal
instead of distal fibulae.  MNA.V.116, 141 and 142 are not
mentioned, so may be cf. Dilophosaurus or Archosauria indet..

<b><i>Dilophosaurus</i> "breedorum"-</b> The incomplete skeleton UCMP
77270 was discovered in 1964 which was initially mentioned by Welles
(1970) as a larger specimen of <i>Dilophosaurus wetherilli</i>. This
was the first specimen of the genus to preserve a nearly complete
cranial crest, the bases of which had been preserved but unnoticed in
the holotype. Welles later (1984) believed UCMP 77270 to be a new
related genus of theropod based on undescribed differences in skull
proportions, vertebrae and especially the femur. Gauthier (1986)
retained the specimen in <i>D. wetherilli</i> and stated Welles had
remarked on its trochanteric shelf in 1984, yet as Charig and Milner
(1990) noted, Gauthier was mistaken and Welles never described the
femur of the specimen. Rowe and Gauthier (1990) also referred it to <i>D.
wetherilli</i> and incorrectly stated it was of similar ontogenetic
stage as the holotype. Paul (1988) was not certain whether it was the
same species or not, but noted the differences might be due to the same
kind of dimorphism that coelophysids show. Welles wrote a description
of UCMP 77270 in which he names it <i>Dilophosaurus breedorum</i>,
which was eventually released by Pickering in 1995. This paper has
controversial status, as it describes the only one of Pickering's taxa
to be accepted as valid by another paleontologist (Olshevsky, DML
online 1999). Olshevsky noted that the publication had no evidence of
following ICZN Articles 8.1.2 and 8.1.3, but considered <i>D.</i>
"breedorum" valid on the condition that Pickering could supply copies
in response to orders. While I have received a copy from Pickering, he
has refused to send them to several other workers or to archive them in
public libraries. Thus Olshevsky's condition has been only partially
met, and whether he still considers the species to be valid is unknown.
Other workers such as Ford (Paleofile.com) consider "breedorum" a nomen
nudum. Incidentally, Olshevsky used the date 1999 for the "breedorum"
paper and stated 1995 "must be a manuscript date, since the description
was not published then and has only appeared through Pickering's
efforts this year (1999)." I personally do not doubt Pickering printed
the "breedorum" paper in 1995, though its distribution at that time is
questionable. I provisionally accept the 1995 date here, though I also
consider the taxon a nomen nudum under Article 8.1. Note that contra
Olshevsky, if the "breedorum" paper is accepted as valid under the
ICZN, "Newtonsaurus" and "Walkersaurus" from the comparative section
would also be valid. In any case, "breedorum" was definitely used in
Pickering's 1995 bibliographic work "Jurassic Park: Unauthorized Jewish
Fractals in Philopatry" as a nomen nudum. In that work, the name is a
label for a photograph of UCMP 77270's skull. Gay (2005) believed it
was a specimen of <i>D. wetherilli</i>, feeling there is a "lack of
significant morphological differences" and considered "breedorum"
invalid, noting "uncertain validity of this name resulting from
publication practices." Gay refers to two femora of differing lengths
(575, 605 mm) and two tibiae (560, 585 mm), believing more than one
individual might be involved, but Welles states only the right hindlimb
is preserved. Tykoski (2005) used the specimen as an example of <i>D.
wetherilli</i> in his thesis and concluded it was an adult (unlike the
types and TMM 43646) using an ontogenetic analysis. He states "at the
behest of Kevin Padian (pers. comm., April, 2003) I refrain from giving
a description of the crest morphology in the skull of UCMP 77270",
perhaps indicating Padian or someone else is working on a new
description of this specimen. Tykoski also states the quadratojugal,
quadrate, sacral centra, distal pubis and metatarsals are not present
in the specimen, which may mean they were lost after Welles'
description. However, he notes a fibula is present, which is not
mentioned by Welles. Tykoski further states the cervical ribs of UCMP
77270 are not fused to their vertebrae, contra Welles and Pickering.
Irmis (2007) referred it to <i>D. wetherilli</i> and noted it had
closed dorsal and proximal caudal neurocentral sutures, unlike the
holotype. Carrano et al. (2012) noted the unfused interdental plates
and trochanteric shelf differ from the holotype, but ascribed this to
individual variation. Madsen and Welles (2000), Yates (2005), Sampson
and Witmer (2007), Smith et al. (2007) and Carrano and Sampson (2008)
all assigned it to <i>D. wetherilli</i> without comment.<br>
Welles and Pickering diagnosed <i>Dilophosaurus</i> "breedorum"
compared to <i>D. wetherilli</i> using several characters. Assessing
their validity is made difficult by UCMP 77270 being older than the
types (based on neurocentral fusion if nothing else) and some of
Welles' (1984) description being based on casted features of the type
patterned after <i>Allosaurus</i>. "Two, very thin, markedly developed
parasagettal crests composed of the nasals + lacrimals + prefrontals"
is also true in <i>D. wetherilli</i>, except that the participation of
the prefrontals (on the medial surface) is uncertain due to UCMP
37302's crests being crushed together. Welles and Pickering later list
the prefrontal participation as a separate autapomorphy. The dental
formula only differs in having two more maxillary teeth and one less
dentary tooth, which is usual individual variation in theropods. Welles
and Pickering claim a separate postfrontal ossification is present in
"breedorum", but state "the sutures are not obvious, and it could be
absent or fused with the postorbital." Also they note the area in <i>D.
wetherilli</i> is badly crushed, so this has little value as an
apomorphy. The authors describe a deep groove along the posteroventral
edge of the postorbital, which sounds similar to the condition in most
megalosauroids (though I'm not sure if theirs also extends on to the
posterior process). The quadratojugal has a posterolateral sulcus above
the quadrate condyles and below the paraquadrate foramen. Both of these
features are apparently different from the <i>wetherilli</i> holotype,
but their significance is uncertain. Finally, Welles and Pickering
state the cervical ribs are fused to their vertebrae (contra Tykoski),
but this varies ontogenetically in <i>"Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>
anyway so would not be unexpected in an old <i>Dilophosaurus</i>
individual. Being a Welles paper, most elements also include
comparisons to their counterparts in <i>D. wetherilli</i> and other
taxa. Most of these differences seem minor, though several support an
adult stage of development- more elongate premaxilla, quadratojugal
fused to quadrate, atlantal centrum and axial intercentrum fused to
axis, deeper cervical pleurocoels, scapulocoracoid fusion, iliopubic
fusion, trochanteric shelf present. Tykoski (2005) also noted other
adult characters lacking in the holotype- various braincase and
intersacral fusions, ilium fused to the sacrum, proximal femoral
articular surfaces well developed, medial femoral epicondyle well
developed, and an oblique ridge on the proximomedial fibula.
Additionally, sacral central fusion was present as noted by Welles and
Pickering. According to Tykoski, the interdental plates are unfused and
tall in UCMP 77270 and TMM 43646, but that they are fused in UCMP 37302
and 37303. These differences cannot be explained by ontogeny and are
not subject to individual variation in other taxa as far as I know.
While they and some of the differences noted by Welles might suggest
multiple species of Kayenta <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, other theropods
known from large numbers of specimens (e.g. <i>Allosaurus,
Tyrannosaurus, Microraptor, Archaeopteryx</i>) also show a high amount
of morphological variation. I follow my recommendations for those taxa
and only recognize a single species of <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, with UCMP
77270 simply being an older individual of <i>D. wetherilli</i>. Marsh
(2012) recently also only recognized a single species in his restudy of
the taxon.<br>
