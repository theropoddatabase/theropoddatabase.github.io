<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Originally conceived
by Huene as a clade including what are now coelophysoids, basal
coelurosaurs (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>, as opposed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>,
megalosaurs and carnosaurs which were grouped with sauropodomorphs as
Pachypodosauria.  This view evolved so that in e.g. 1923, Huene
now included <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span> and tyrannosaurids in
the clade, then considered sister to his Carnosauria in
Theropoda.  By 1932, oviraptorosaurs, <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>
and dromaeosaurids
were included by Huene.  Romer's (1956) textbook set the consensus
that tyrannosaurids and probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>
were carnosaurs instead, making a division between small coelurosaurs
and large carnosaurs implicit.  Ostrom's (1969) recognition that <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
exhibited a mix of Romer's coelurosaur (20 of 35) and carnosaur (13 of
36) characters began the breakdown of this classic division, stating "I
presently have strong reservations about the validity of these two
categories."  This collapse is exemplified by Barsbold's 1977
classification restricting Coelurosauria to coelophysoids and coelurids
sensu lato, raising Ornithomimosauria, Oviraptorosauria and
Deinonychosauria to equivalent rank, and Welles' (1984) review of
Triassic and Jurassic theropods that concluded they "can be grouped
into families ... but that the relationships of the families are not
clear."  Thulborn (1984) also rejected the dichotomy, placing <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>, tyrannosaurids,
troodontids, ornithomimids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
closer to birds than allosaurids, but has compsognathids and
dromaeosaurids outside what today would be considered Avetheropoda.
Paul's (1988) influential phylogeny abandoned the term
coelurosaur altogether, placing coelophysoids basal to averostrans as
in the current consensus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span> just outside
Avetheropoda, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Proceratosaurus</span>
as basal carnosaurs, and suggesting a Protoavia equivalent in content
to modern Maniraptoriformes.  Around this time, Gauthier's
unpublished thesis proposed our current usage of Coelurosauria, for
"birds, and all theropods that are closer to birds than to
Carnosauria."  This excluded coelophysoids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span> and tyrannosaurids,
but did include <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>,
ornithomimosaurs, oviraptorosaurs, deinonychosaurs and birds. 
Gauthier and Padian (1985) published this concept, but no phylogenetic
definition was provided until Gauthier (1986).  Coelurosauria's
content has remained largely stable since, with the addition of
tyrannosaurs and therizinosaurs the consensus as of 1994 and of
alvarezsauroids, first recognized as a clade in that same year. 
The inclusion of megaraptorans is still debated, with some authors
placing them in Carnosauria.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Coelurosauridae</span>- Ever since the
erection of Coelurosauria, authors have sometimes listed a family
Coelurosauridae, generally as an alternative for Coelurosauria or
Coeluridae.  However, a genus Coelurosaurus has never been validly
named, with published listings being misspellings of <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelosaurus</span>" or <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurosauravus</span>. 
Thus a Coelurosauridae or Coelurosauroidea could not exist under the
ICZN.  The earliest authorship for the family name Coelurosauridae
was listed as "Cope, 1882" by Steel (1970) as a junior synonym of
Coeluridae.  However, none of Cope's publications for that year
use the term, the closest being his 'Marsh on the classification of the
Dinosauria' which uses Coeluria.  Similarly, Hay (1930:184) lists
Coelurosauridae as being used by Williston (1925), but this cannot be
confirmed without a copy of that textbook.  Nopcsa (1928:183)
definitely uses Coelurosauroidea as a suborder equivalent to
Coelurosauria (using Megalosauroidea instead of Carnosauria as well),
which given ICZN rules would also establish other family level varients
for that year if Williston's was unreliable.  <br>
<b>Metatheropoda</b>- Metatheropoda was named in a cladogram by Ji and
Ji (2001) as a clade within Coelurosauria containing <i>Compsognathus</i>,
<i>Sinosauropteryx</i> and Maniraptoriformes. Which coelurosaurs were
excluded is not specified (though tyrannosauroids are a likely
candidate) and the clade was not defined. The caption merely listed
"down-like protofeathers" as a diagnosis, which suggests it was named
to encompass feathered coelurosaurs. This idea is complicated by their
inclusion of <i>Compsognathus</i>, which they place in a new subclade
Aptilonia. Though Aptilonia is not defined either, the etymology and
pairing with <i>Sinosauropteryx</i>'s Eoptilonia suggests it implies a
lack of feathers in <i>Compsognathus</i>, though this is in all
probability preservational. As feathers are probably symplesiomorphic
for dinosaurs (<i>Tianyulong</i>, <i>Kulindadromeus</i>),
Metatheropoda seems like an unnecessary clade. <br>
<b>Coelurosauria defined</b>- Xu et al.'s (2011) definition differs
from the standard one by including <i>Sinraptor</i> and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
as external specifiers. <i>Sinraptor</i>'s inclusion is superfluous,
as an (<i>Allosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus</i> (<i>Sinraptor, Passer</i>))
topology has never been advocated. If <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> is a
tyrannosauroid (Paul, 1988; Kurzanov, 1989; Molnar et al., 1990), this
redefinition would exclude tyrannosauroids from Coelurosauria. 
One thing I object to is the use of <i>Passer</i> as an internal
specifier for Coelurosauria, as birds were nor originally classified as
coelurosaurs in Huene, 1914 or by anyone until the 1970's at least.
Huene included what would today be called coelophysids, coelurids,
compsognathids, <i>Ornitholestes</i> and ornithomimids. The best
internal specifier for Coelurosauria in my opinion is <i>Ornithomimus</i>.
It's always been a coelurosaur, and has always been placed closer to
birds than <i>Allosaurus</i> (unlike <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Coelurus</i>
or <i>Ornitholestes</i>- Paul, 1988; Novas, 1992). Thus I would
suggest (<i>Ornithomimus velox</i> &lt;- <i>Allosaurus fragilis,
Carcharodontosaurus saharicus</i>) as a definition for Coelurosauria.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Buffetaut et al., 1996) partially closed

(after Rauhut, 2003) two parallel vertical ridges on ilial blade above
and in front of acetabulum.<br>
(after Samathi et al., 2015) anterior to mid dorsal parapophyses with
long and stalk-like pedicels; notch on dorso-posterior part of
postacetabular process (not shown in the original description where the
pelvic photo was roughly cut out from its background; but see Carrano
et
al., 2012: Fig. 6). <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Buffetaut et
al. (1996) originally diagnosed <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
with a long list of characters, many primitive for avetheropods-
proximal caudal vertebrae with tall, slender neural spines; mid caudal
vertebrae with accessory neural spines; proximal chevrons long,
straight and slender; long and relatively low ilium; pubis with long,
straight shaft terminating in massive distal boot; no ambiens crest on
pubis; or coelurosaurs- preacetabular process with incipient cuppedicus
shelf; well defined proximolateral ischial scar; ischium slender. 
A
final character, ischium curved (ventrally), is common in carnosaurs
and basal coelurosaurs.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
This was discovered in 1993 and first mentioned by "an incomplete
skeleton of a large theropod" ... "which includes a well preserved
pubis with a a large distal "boot" and by Suteethorn et a. (1995) as "a
partly articulated skeleton of a large theropod, including the dorsal
and caudal vertebrae, the sacrum and a large part of the pelvis." 
It was briefly described by Buffetaut et al.
(1996) as a new taxon of tyrannosaurid.  Samathi has made a
project of redescribing the specimen in detail, in both his Masters
(2013) and PhD (2019) theses.  Meeting abstracts about the dorsal
vertebrae (Samathi et al., 2008; Samathi, 2015) and the project in
general (Samathi et al., 2013, 2015) have been published, but not the
osteology itself.  <br>
Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1998) say "a recently discovered theropod
tibia from Phu Wiang, in all likelihood referable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>, is not unlike that
of the primitive tyrannosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>",
while Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1999) say "a well-preserved tibia found
at Phu Wiang, together with a partial sacrum resembling the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus isanensis</span>,
exhibits tyrannosaurid features and very probably belongs to this
taxon."  These were partially addressed by Samathi et al. (2019a)
who stated "the tibia with partial sacrum provisionally assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
by Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1999) more probably belongs to another
taxon of theropod found in the Phu Wiang locality (see below)", and
while they never reference this again, <span style="font-style: italic;">Phuwiangvenator</span>
is the only taxon that preserves these elements (and has parts
discovered since 1993).  Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1999) stated "a
maxilla fragment containing
compressed teeth, also from Phu Wiang, [which] may also belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>,
but it is very incomplete", which has since been described as
carcharodontosaurid by Buffetaut and Suteethorn (2012). 
Similarly, while Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1998) say "abundant
blade-like, serrated theropod teeth from the Sao Khua Formation
probably belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>",
<span style="font-style: italic;">Phuwiangvenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Vayuraptor</span>
have since been described from the formation and likely had similar
teeth.  These generic theropod teeth are listed here under
Averostra.<br>
Buffetaut et al.'s (1996) original assignment to Tyrannosauridae would
today be recognized as a placement in basal Tyrannosauroidea, as
albertosaurines and tyrannosaurines were listed as more derived. 
Pharris (DML, 1997) made persuasive arguments for the assignment of <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
to Sinraptoridae (= Metriacanthosauridae), but neither of these early
studies were based on quantitative analyses.  The first
quantitavive analyses to include <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
in a theropod sample including more than tyrannosauroids recovered it
as a carnosaur/allosauroid (Rauhut, 2000 and 2003; Holtz et al., 2004),
although the latter had it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span>
which is now often recognized as a coelurosaur.  More recently,
Carrano et al. (2012) found <i>Siamotyrannus</i> to be a derived
metriacanthosaurine, echoing Pharris' idea.  Samathi (2015)
updated <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
in that matrix and found it to have "a 'basal' coelurosaur position",
but as Samathi et al. (2015) noted "the alternative possibility that it
might belong to basal Allosauria or Metriacanthosauridae cannot be
rejected" at only three more steps.  Samathi and Chanthasit (2017)
reported that in Novas et al.'s tetanurine matrix, <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span>
falls out as the sister taxon of Tyrannoraptora, with megaraptorans
more stemward.  A variant of this is shown in the analysis of
Samanthi et al. (2019b) where it falls out sister to Megaraptora plus
Tyrannoraptora along with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilantaisaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>.  <br>

<b>Referred-</b> (OUM J29780) partial ilium (~93 mm) (Galton, 1976)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Foster and Chure (2000) and Galton and Molnar (2005)
referred OUM J28971 to <i>Iliosuchus</i>, but it was removed by Benson
(2009).<br>
This taxon is traditionally allied with <i>Stokesosaurus</i> and thus
with tyrannosauroids due to the vertical ilial ridge. The concave
anterior edge on the pubic peduncle is also a tyrannosauroid-like
character. Yet both are actually widespread among basal coelurosaurs.
The reduced ischial peduncle is similar to coelurosaurs and <i>Concavenator</i>,
and the mediolaterally narrow pubic peduncle is similar to most
avetheropods. Benson and Carrano et al. (2012) considered <i>Iliosuchus</i>
an indeterminate avetheropod or juvenile <i>Megalosaurus</i>, despite
not considering <i>Megalosaurus</i> to be an avetheropod. Yet <i>Iliosuchus</i>
differs from <i>Megalosaurus</i> in the characters noted above (<i>Megalosaurus</i>'
vertical ridge is much lower) in addition to having a more anteriorly
angled pubic peduncle which lacks a concave posterior margin. It may
also possess a unique combination of characters when compared to other
taxa, even if it lacks autapomorphies. It is provisionally retained
here as a valid genus of coelurosaur.<br>

Material</b>- (GLRCM coll.; B) tooth (2.3 mm; FABL 2.6 mm)<br>
(GLRCM coll.; G) tooth (1.9 mm; FABL 1.7 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- These two teeth were labeled as "dromaeosaur-like" by
Metcalf and Walker (1994).<br>
Teeth B and G in their figure 18.7 exhibit similar morphology, so may
belong to the same taxon. Mesial serrations are present apically, while
the crowns are short and slightly recurved. B and G have DSDIs of 1.17
and 1.4 respectively. Serrations are fairly flat and not hooked
apically, but are taller than wide on the distal carina. Serration
density is 5-6/mm on B, and 12/mm on G. G may have a constricted base,
though blood grooves are not apparent on either specimen. <br>
They resemble those referred to posterior teeth of <i>cf.
Compsognathus sp.</i> by Zinke (1998) except that B has a slightly
lower serration count.<br>

2002) <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Lydekker (1888) referred a manual ungual (BMNH R899)
to <i>Aristosuchus</i>,
but Naish (2002) notes it has a low and distally positioned flexor
tubercle unlike the paratype ungual so may be from another species. It
was illustrated in Naish et al. (2001) as an indeterminate
theropod.  Note the NHMUK online catalogue incorrectly indicates
this is now NHMUK R889, although the original number is still written
on the fossil, and the physical catalogue lists R899 as "Ungual
phalanx. imperfect anteriorly" and R889 as "Plastron and costal plates
of chelonian".<br>
NHMUK R5194 was originally collected in 1917 and catalogued as <i>Hypsilophodon</i>,
but described by Galton (1973) and referred to <i>Aristosuchus</i>. <br>
Tibia MIWG 5137 was discovered in 1976, and described by Naish (1999)
as possibly being <i>Aristosuchus</i> as it was said to be virtually
identical to <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirischia</span>. It
has since been figured by Naish et al. (2001) as "a possible
compsognathid theropod."  Carrano (1998) listed the tibia BMNH
R.9230 as <i>Calamosaurus foxi</i>, which based on the photo in the
online NHMUK catalogue is a cast of MIWG 5137 made in 1977.<br>
Hutt (2001) listed IWCMS 1995.208, MIWG 5823 and MIWG 5824 as <i>Aristosuchus</i>
sp., but the specimens are undescribed. <br>
Naish (2002) illustrated partial ischium BMNH R6426 as a possible <i>Aristosuchus</i>
specimen, but the NHMUK online catalogue indicates this is actually
NHMUK 6424.  Unfortunately, the physical catalogue states its
history is unknown but was acquired in 1953.<br>
Mattsson (pers. comm., 2015) informs me of two distal metatarsals
discovered in 1996 and initially identified as testudine elements,
which are now on display at the Dinosaur Expeditions Centre.<br>
These specimens may belong to <i>Aristosuchus, </i><i>Calamosaurus</i>,
<i>Calamospondylus</i> (difficult to determine as the type is lost and
poorly described), <i>Ornithodesmus</i>, <i>Thecocoelurus</i> and/or <i>Yaverlandia</i>
and have been compared to basal tyrannosauroids, coelurids and
compsognathids. Additionally, femur MIWG 6214 (Naish, 2000), tibia
NHMUK R186 (Lydekker, 1888), and the two fragmentary skeletons
exhibited as <i>Calamosaurus</i> at the Dinosaur Expeditions Centre
(Mattsson, pers. comm. 2015) may belong to the same taxa, though these
have been recently hypothesized to be ornithomimosaurs (Allain et al.,
2014).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered by the
Sino-American expeditions between 2001 and 2010.  These are called
Morphotypes 1, 4 and 6 by Han et al. (2011), who refer 1 and 4 to a
basal tetanurine or basal tyrannosauroid, and 6 to a deinonychosaur or
basal alvarezsaur.  They are placed in Coelurosauria here based on
the lack of mesial serrations in some.  The five Morphotype 1
teeth "were found in close association and are similar to one another
in size and shape, which suggests that they may belong to one species
and perhaps even to a single individual."<br>

Lasseron listed FSAC-KM-D2-11 as both a 'Theropoda gen. et sp.
indet. morphotype I' and 'Theropoda gen. et sp. indet. morphotype II'
tooth, without using a number in brackets to designate multiple teeth
falling under one specimen number.  As the mesial serration
density is
listed, the measurements given belong to a morphotype II tooth. 
The MNHN specimens are referred to Maniraptora by Knoll and
Ruiz-Omenaca (2009) as they lack mesial serrations, but these are
also absent in several other coelurosaurs (e.g. megaraptorans,
compsognathid-grade maniraptoromorphs).  Lasseron stated his
Theropoda gen. et sp. indet. morphotype I were similar to Knoll and
Ruiz-Omenaca's Maniraptora indet. Morphotype I, while his Coelurosauria
gen. et sp. indet. morphotype I is similar to their Maniraptora indet.
Morphotype III.  Knoll and Ruiz-Omenaca stated Maniraptora indet.
Morphotype I resembled  <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>,
Hell Creek <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
and European teeth described as Dromaeosauridae indet., while
Morphotype 2 was similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Juravenator</span>
posterior premaxillary teeth, and Morphotype III most like juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
teeth.  Lasseron finds quantitative analysis classifies
FSAC-KM-D2-11 as noasaurid, although it overlaps with most groups of
small theropods in the figure.  Lasseron et al. list all four
teeth under FSAC-KM-B'-26 and FSAC-KM-D1-6 as Dromaeosauridae and both
FSAC-KM-A2-9 teeth and FSAC-KM-B'-22 as Maniraptora.  <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Rich and Vickers-Rich (1994) reported the first eight
theropod teeth to be discovered at the Flat Rocks site, more of which
were reported in successive Dinosaur Dreaming field reports and briefly
mentioned in papers describing new taxa from the site. They have
recently been described by Benson et al. (2012), who state more
detailed work is being done by Salisbury, Currie and Novas on the more
than ninety teeth known by then. While Kool (2003) noted that
preliminary study by Currie of the forty teeth known at the time
indicated the presence of four taxa of small theropod, and Rich (2004)
stated study by Salisbury indicated three taxa, Benson et al. described
only one morphology as being present. Rich and Vickers-Rich identified
the teeth as dromaeosaurid, which has been followed by most later
authors who identified them past Theropoda. This was based on the lack
of mesial serrations, but this is known in many other coelurosaurs
(e.g. megaraptorans, compsognathids, most troodontids). Benson et al.
labeled them as possible megaraptorans. <br>
NMV P221187 was first reported by Kool (1997) as a juvenile theropod.
Benson et al. referred this to Neovenatoridae instead of
Tyrannosauridae based on the ventral median keel, but this is present
in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and other coelurosaurs as well. <br>

Material</b>- (AM F103591) (juvenile) partial dorsal centrum<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Molnar (1999) found this most closely resembles <i>"Ichthyornis"
minusculus</i>, an enantiornithine. This was based on the D-shaped
articular surface, which differs from <i>Ichthyornis</i>' circular
surface. However, taxa such as <i>Confuciusornis</i> and <i>Microraptor</i>
also have D-shaped articulations, as do some of <i>Microvenator</i>'s
centra. Unfortunately, the distribution is hard to establish since
small theropods generally don't preserve dorsal centra in anterior or
posterior view. The small size (centrum height 5.9 mm) probably
constrains it to Coelurosauria, even though it is a juvenile.<br>

Kuwajima Formation of the Itoshiro Subgroup of the Tetori Group, Japan<br>
Material</b>- (FPM 85050-1; Kaga-ryu) (~6 m) partial anterior tooth
(&gt;19.5 mm) (Manabe et al., 1989)<br>
? tooth (Azuma, 1991)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The first tooth was discovered in 1985 and referred to
Carnosauria. This was illustrated and described in detail by Manabe et
al. (1989), who assigned it to Carnosauria fam. indet.. This was based
on comparison to a supposedly carnosaurian tooth (NSMP17178-17180) from
Lufeng. Between 1985 and 1990 an additional tooth was discovered,
referred to Megalosauridae indet (Azuma, 1991). Hisa (1988) referred to
at least one of the teeth as "Kagasaurus", which is a nomen nudum
because it wasn't associated with a description. Manabe et al. state
FPM 85050-1 has the nickname Kaga-ryu, while Azuma calls both teeth
Kaga-ryu. Dong et al. (1990) regard the teeth as Megalosauridae indet..
Whether both teeth are referrable to the same taxon is unknown, as the
second has yet to be described.<br>
FPM 85050-1 preserves on the the basal two-thirds of a tooth with a
FABL 10.6 mm and a basal width of 5.6 mm. The lingual face is flat and
the labial one convex, indicating this is probably a premaxillary or
anterior dentary tooth. The mesial carina lacks serrations, while the
distal carina has 17 serrations per 5 mm. The serrations are rounded
and angled slightly apically.<br>
The flat lingual face is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Saltriovenator</span>,
most abelisauroids, allosaurians and coelurosaurs (except <span style="font-style: italic;">Bicentenaria</span>, compsognathid-grade
maniraptoromorphs, <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>,
birds and some paravians with serrationless teeth).  at least some
carnosaurs and most coelurosaurs (except those taxa which lack
carinae). Abelisaurids and allosaurs always have mesial serrations,
often extending to the base of the crown. Some non-maniraptoriform
coelurosaurs and dromaeosaurids have anterior teeth which lack only
mesial serrations, making "Kagasaurus" likely to be a member of one of
these groups.<br>

....(GSP/MSM-60-19; intended syntype of "Vitakridrinda sulaimani")
proximal femur (Malkani, 2004)<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Malkani (2006a) lists several characters for
"Vitakridrinda" in his diagnosis. Those involving the snout
GSP/MSM-155-19 ("an rostrum") now refer to the baurusuchid <span style="font-style: italic;">Induszalim</span> (here considered a
junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pabwehshi</span>),
while those of the supposed braincase GSP/MSM-61-19 ("thick and long
basioccipital condyle articulated with posterior braincase") now apply
to a specimen referred by Malkani to his titanosaur "Gspsaurus". 
Malkani's characters "laterally compressed tooth, having low crown and
extremely low ratio of crown height and rostro-caudal width" refer to a
block containing supposed teeth GSP/MSM-61-19 which do not appear to be
dinosaurian teeth regardless of what they actually are.  The
syntype
femora are diagnosed as having- "greater trochanter, eroded inturned
head with joint (only joint are found in both left and right proximal
femur), and hollow and thick peripheral bone of cross section". The
former is plesiomorphic for archosaurs, the second plesiomorphic for
dinosaurs, and the last typical of non-avialan theropods.<br>
Another character listed by Malkani is "amphicoelous vertebrae", but
this is based on referred specimens (several of which he referred to
"Vitakrisaurus" in 2020b which seem to be sauropod) and is
plesiomorphic for archosaurs. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Malkani's GSP
specimen numbers are designed so that the last number is
the locality and the first is the specimen-specific number from that
locality, so are listed in order of locality first.  Malkani first
mentioned "Vitakridrinda" in his 2003 description of
"Brohisaurus", stating only "<span style="font-style: italic;">Vitakridrinda
Sulaimani</span> Abelisaurid Theropod (Malkani,2004a)."  The only
publication in the bibliography solely by Malkani is
his saurischian biodiversity paper, listed as in progress, but not
actually published until 2006. As the 2003 mention of "Vitakridrinda"
lacks a description or definition (ICZN Article 13.1.1; note the
reference to Malkani, 2004a doesn't count under 13.1.2 since it was not
published yet), was not indicated to be a new taxon (16.1), and did not
have a type specimen indicated (16.4), it was a nomen nudum at the
time.  The first description of "Vitakridrinda" is generally
claimed to
be the 2004 "Saurischian Dinosaurs from Late Cretaceous of Pakistan",
as referenced in Malkani 2006a and the Paleobiology Database. Yet ICZN
Article 9.9 lists "abstracts of articles, papers, posters, texts of
lectures, and similar material when issued primarily to participants at
meetings, symposia, colloquia or congresses" as not being published
work, so the paper doesn't count. In addition, it still violates 16.4
in not indicating a type specimen, saying only "One new genus and
species of Abelisaurids Theropod dinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Vitakridrinda sulaimani</span>
is diagnosed on the basis of rostrum, thick basioccipital condyle
articulated with posterior braincase; a pair of proximal femora with
its greater trochanter and partial head joint; and hollow and thick
peripheral bone of femoral cross section; and amphicoelous
vertebrae." 
Note while Malkani's "Saurischian
dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous Pab Formation of Pakistan" has been
listed as being published in 2005 (Malkani, 2006a) or "2004d" and in
review (Malkani, 2006b), it was not published until 2015. Two 2006
publications of Malkani's almost describe
"Vitakridrinda" sufficiently, with 2006b being published in December,
while 2006a was published in April. However, a continual issue with
Malkani's taxa is that they almost always credit their authorship to
prior invalid publications instead of proposing them as new taxa, which
is necessary for all names after 1999- ICZN Article 16.1 is "Every new
name published after 1999, including new replacement names (nomina
nova), must be explicitly indicated as intentionally new."  Thus
until
Malkani publishes a description of "Vitakridrinda sulaimani" as gen et
sp. nov. instead of Malkani, 2006, and not in a conference abstract,
the name will never be valid.<br>
The material was probably mostly discovered in 2001, as Malkani
discovered 2700 bones and bone fragments from the area at that time.
The femora GSP/MSM-59-19 and GSP/MSM-60-19 were found associated in one
mass and seemingly belong to one individual. The supposed braincase
GSP/MSM-62-19 was found
100 meters away in the same horizon, while the snout GSP/MSM-155-19 and
supposed tooth block GSP/MSM-61-19 were
found later (though early enough to be mentioned in 2004) and 50 meters
from the braincase. Malkani believed they all belong to the same
individual based on supposed lack of transportation and similar size,
but the area of separation is so large that this lacks merit. While
Malkani (2006a, b) referred to them all as the holotype, they may more
properly be
syntypes, and their uncertain derivation from one animal would make
selection of a lectotype desirable. Indeed Malkani (2014a) states
"Previously the specimen GSP/MSM-155-19 is assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Vitakridrinda sulaimani</span> (theropod
dinosaur) but due to secondary palate nature it is being established as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Induszalim bala</span> -new genus and
species of very large mesoeucrocodile" and "Its braincase and
basioccipital can be assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Maojandino
alami</span> (because of the yellow brown matrix covered on supposed
braincase is same as on associated vertebrae and limb elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Maojandino alami</span>)
if character supports after specimen preparation."  Malkani (2019
online, 2020a) later referred the supposed braincase to his sauropod
taxon "Gspsaurus pakistani" instead, which he synonymized "Maojandino"
with.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Identification of material</span>-
Given the designation of the snout as the holotype of a new taxon and
Malkani's referral of the supposed braincase to another taxon, this
leaves the supposed tooth section and femora as potential
holotypes. 
The latter are suggested here as the femora are definitely theropodan
while the tooth block is more controversial.  Early photos of the
femora were either too small to be useful (e.g. Malkani, 2006a: fig.
5-8) or in a generally unhelpful distal cross section view (e.g.
Malkani, 2006a: fig. 14a).  The thickness/diameter ratio of ~0.20
is
typical of non-avialan theropods.  Malkani (2020b) finally
published a
high resolution photo in medial view (fig. 1) which shows the shafts
are broken a few centimeters distal to the head and that the medial
portion of the head is broken off in both as well.   The anterior
trochanter is proximally separate from the shaft unlike crocodyliforms,
sauropods and ankylosaurs.  Contrary to the condition in
abelisaurids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Carnotaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ekrixinatosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rahiolisaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarascosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Xenotarsosaurus</span>)
the anterior trochanter is proximally placed so that it diverges from
the shaft at the midpoint of the femoral head.  Among Late
Cretaceous
Gondwanan dinosaurs this also differs from hadrosaurids, noasaurids and
carcharodontosaurids, but is similar to megaraptorans and
unenlagiines.  While at least the right femur would seem more
similar
to unenlagiines (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Unenlagia
comahuensis</span>) than megaraptorans (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Australovenator</span>)
based on the anteroposteriorly narrow anterior trochanter, this is may
be due to the oblique perspective of Malkani's figure and the material
is referred to Coelurosauria incertae sedis.  A more precise
phylogenetic position is not suggested here pending details visible in
additional perspectives such as greater trochanter anteroposterior
width, anterior trochanter sectional shape and presence of a posterior
trochanter.  Its size is larger than most maniraptoromorphs but is
comparable to the unenlagiine <span style="font-style: italic;">Austroraptor</span>. 
<br>
Based on Malkani's (2006a) description, figure 14b of GSP/MSM-62-19
(mislabeled GSP/MSM-61-19 in early papers) is supposed to be an
anterior view of paroccipital processes and basipterygoid processes,
which is similar in rough outline to <i>Abelisaurus</i> (assuming the
supposed basipterygoid
processes are basal tubera instead) except for the decurved and much
taller paroccipital processes. The latter features match titanosaur
braincases better, though in that case everything beneath the occipital
condyle area would be broken off. In either case, it's only the shape
that is similar, and since there are no obvious surface features or
natural edges, it could just as easily be part of an ilium, vertebra,
etc.. Figures 15a and b do have the rough shape of an occipital
condyle, but no apparent foramen magnum above it. The possibility it
could merely be the shape of the other side of the sediment nodule
should not be excluded, especially as the "anterior" view shows a gray
bone shape in the plane of a yellow nodule while the "posterior" and
"lateral" views show a yellow nodule shaped into what are supposed to
be bone structures.  As noted above, Malkani (2014) refers this to
his
sauropod "Maojandino alami" which he later synonymizes with another of
his sauropods "Gspsaurus pakistani" (Malkani, 2020a), but it is
provisionally placed as Titanosauria indet. here pending study of
Malkani's sauropod taxa.<br>
Regarding the snout GSP/MSM-155-19, Wilson (pers. comm., 2014)
correctly observed the posterior view (fig. 2C in Malkani, 2010) is
very similar to the snout cross section of <i>Pabwehshi</i>.  <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>As noted above, Malkani (2014a)
makes this snout the holotype of his new baurusuchid <span style="font-style: italic;">Induszalim bala</span>, here provisionally
retained as a junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pabwehshi
pakistanensis</span>
as the supposedly distinct characters are due to misinterpreting
elements and the section being more anterior in position (see entry for
details).<br>
The final supposed holotype specimen is block GSP/MSM-61-19 (mislabeled
GSP/MSM-62-19 in early papers), initially reported as including the
triangular coronal section of a tooth (e.g. Malkani, 2006a). 
Malkani
(2020) later included a drawing showing at least thirteen additional
much smaller structures labeled as teeth and another two labeled as
cranial bones.  Malkani compares it to abelisaurids, but while the
first premaxillary tooth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Majungasaurus</span>
is roughly similar in shape with a flat lingual side, it differs
greatly in having enamel of roughly equal thickness around the entire
tooth.  The structure in GSP/MSM-61-19 instead has "walls" that
steadily decrease in thickness to tapered points "mesially" and
"distally" from a maximum thickness at the "labial" corner.  This
is
unlike any theropod tooth sections, so the Vitakri structure is
something else.  The additional supposed teeth are at most a third
the
size of the main supposed tooth and are of varying shapes, while the
only visible supposed cranial element (described as "eye peripheral
bone/lacrimal and other trirays star like bones") is equal in size to
some of these larger supposed teeth.  Thus if the major structure
were
a tooth, these would be far too small to be additional teeth or
circumorbital elements like a lacrimal or postorbital.  Given the
preservation style in Vitakri taxa like <span style="font-style: italic;">Induszalim</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Vitakrisaurus</span>,
it is likely this block shows cross sections of often hollow cranial
and/or axial elements.  It is tentatively referred to Archosauria
indet. here.<br>
The paratype vertebrae are from other localities and do not overlap the
type material, so cannot be convincingly referred to the same taxon.
Four of them (GSP/MSM-53-2, 54-2, 55-2 and 57-3) were later referred to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Vitakrisaurus</span>
by Malkani (2020) and are here placed in Titanosauria based on their
size and anteriorly placed neural arches (in the caudals). 
GSP/MSM-56-1 was originally called a caudal vertebra (Malkani, 2006a)
and later an anterior dorsal (Malkani, 2020).  The lack of a large
diapophysis suggests this may be an axis instead, tentatively assigned
to Titanosauria based on the broad, rounded and posteriorly sloped
neural spine.  This would make Malkani's supposed posterior side
anterior, and note his labeled hyposphenes don't match the narrow
structure ventral to more horizontal postzygapophyseal surfaces seen in
abelisaurids.  GSP/MSM-58-15 was identified as a caudal and later
(2020) as a proximal caudal, which seems correct.  The size and
anteriorly placed neural arch resemble titanosaurs.  Note the
supposed
transverse process is a broken  posterodorsal corner while the
supposed
chevron facets are also broken surfaces.  The material referred by
Malkani (2009) is far too fragmentary to be justified, including cross
sections of long bones, fragments of vertebral centra, and material
that Malkani himself lists as possibly non-fossil and coprolites. These
and most of the several additional fragmentary specimens referred by
Malkani (2020) are here placed in Archosauria indet..  One
exception is
distal caudal centrum GSI/MSM-1049-16, which is elongate (elongation
index ~2.5 unlike crocodyliforms or large ornithischians), amphicoelous
and has "parallel longitudinal ridges/fibrous/laminar structures
alternated by long grooves trending antero-posteriorly located on all
sides except the anterior and posterior concave articular
surfaces." 
These latter may be the same longitudinal grooves and ridges present in
many paravians like unenlagiines, so could belong to "Vitakridrinda" if
the femoral similarities hold up.  The supposed pes GSP/MSM-303-2
(here
identified as a series of vertebrae in section) was referred to <i>Vitakridrinda</i>
by Malkani (2009), but later made the holotype of supposed abelisauroid
<i>Vitakrisaurus</i> by Malkani (2010b).  The latter is placed in
Archosauria incertae sedis here.<br>

Benson et al.'s paper was originally released online on October 14 2009
but not officially published until January 2010.  Since
Megaraptora is not a family-level clade however, it is not bound by the
rules of the ICZN and thus the 2009 date is here considered valid.<br>
The taxa included in this clade have had a controversial history.
Hucknull et al. (2009) noted similarities between <i>Australovenator</i>,
<i>Fukuiraptor</i> and <i>"Allosaurus"</i> "robustus". I noted early
on (online, 2008) that <i>Aerosteon</i> and <i>Orkoraptor</i> were
extremely similar. Benson et al. (2010) were the first to propose a
relationship between all of these taxa though, along with <i>Megaraptor</i>.
They placed them in their new clade Megaraptora, which they found to be
sister to <i>Chilantaisaurus</i> and <i>Neovenator</i> within
Carcharodontosauridae (their Carcharodontosauria). Novas et al. (2013)
later reevaluated Benson et al.'s characters and used a different
dataset to place megaraptorans in Tyrannosauroidea, more derived than <i>Dilong</i>
and proceratosaurids, sister to <i>Xiongguanlong</i>
and tyrannosaurids. While Cau (2018) recovers megaraptorans in this
position too, only two steps move them to just outside Tyrannoraptora
as basal coelurosaurs.  This compromise position is used here
pending more extensive future analyses.<br>
Unfortunately, the original definition of Megaraptora assumes a
carnosaurian relationship, so does not include any coelurosaur external
specifiers and would be synonymous with Coelurosauria in my and Novas
et al.'s (2013) phylogenies. To avoid this, Novas et al. added <i>Passer
domesticus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> to the definition.<br>

<b>Material</b>- (TNM 03041) incomplete mid caudal vertebra (80 mm),
partial mid caudal vertebra<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered between
2002 and 2005, this material was described as theropod by O'Connor et
al. (2006) and referred to the Unit I of the Red Sandstone Group at the
time.  Roberts et al. (2010) subsequently revised the
stratigraphic
nomenclature, naming Unit I the Galula Formation.<br>
The caudals are amphicoelous, with a narrow ventral median groove, and
centra 153% taller than wide.  Particularly interesting is that
"distinct cranial centrodiapophyseal and prezygodiapophyseal laminae
demarcate a substantial infraprezygapophyseal fossa on the neural
arch", which are rarely developed so well in such elongated theropod
caudals (centrum length 174% of height).  Notably absent in
abelisaurids, spinosaurids and carcharodontosaurids, a similar
situation is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Maip</span>. 
This could thus be the first recognized African megaraptoran, which
should be expected in the continent given their distribution in
Australia and South America.<br>

anteromedially curving deltopectoral crest that protrudes almost as far
anteriorly as it is long proximodistally and bears a pitted scar on its
anterior surface; obliquely oriented ulnar condyle.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Hu's (1964)
original diagnosis was- "Humerus massive and elongate. Ungual strongly
curved. Fourth trochanter of femur less developed. Tibia shorter than
femur. Three metatarsals, short and not compactly united."<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was discovered in 1960.  White et al. (2012)
noted "morphological features [which] suggest the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilantaisaurus</span>
ungual belongs to the second digit." Hu (1964) believed three other
associated elements to be carnosaurian and
"most probably belong to the same species."  Benson and Xu (2008)
referred the tooth IVPP V2884.8 to Theropoda indet. (here Averostra
indet.), the mid caudal vertebra IVPP V2884.X to be Sauropoda indet.
(originally in Rauhut, 2003) and a distal caudal centrum to be
Dinosauria indet. (here Eusaurischia indet.).  Rauhut mentions a
third vertebra that "shows the same depressions underneath the
transverse process as found in <span style="font-style: italic;">'C.'
maortuensis</span> [<span style="font-style: italic;">Shaochilong</span>]",
but Benson and Xu note this is actually catalogued as IVPP V2564.6, not
V2884, and it is here provisionally referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaochilong</span>.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Originally placed in Megalosauridae sensu lato by
Hu (1964), both Paul (1988) and Molnar et al. (1990) considered it part
of a paraphyletic Allosauridae more closely related to tyrannosaurids
than <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> based on its
posteriorly reduced metatarsal III. <i>Chilantaisaurus</i> was later
identified as a megalosauroid by Chure (2000) and Rauhut (2003) based
on its straight humerus and elongate supposed manual ungual I. The
latter author found it to be the sister taxon of Spinosauridae based on
the form of the tibial surface that articulates with the astragalar
ascending process, being a rounded medially limited ridge in both <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>
and <i>Cristatusaurus</i>. Benson and Xu (2008) found that <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>
had some characters suggestive of avetheropod affinities (m. cuppedicus
fossa; proximally wedge-shaped metatarsal III), and shared a prominent
ulnar epicondyle with allosauroids, and a weakly hooked preacetabular
process and reduced fourth trochanter with coelurosaurs. Yet they also
noted the anteriorly flat distal humerus and large humerofemoral ratio
are unlike allosauroids. They noted that <i>Coelurus</i>
also has a rounded medially limited ridge on its distal tibia, and that
some avetheropods have straight humeri and an elongate manual ungual I
too. The low astragalar ascending process is unlike coelurosaurs and
most carnosaurs however. Benson et al. (2010) and Carrano et al. (2012)
found it to be a megaraptoran, while Novas et al. (2013) found it to be
unresolved in Avetheropoda less derived than Tyrannoraptora (including
megaraptorans) + Compsognathidae, and Porfiri et al. (2014) recovered
it as the most basal coelurosaur.  Most recently, Rauhut et al.
(2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix to recover it
as a basal carcharodontosaurid sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>.<br>
When constrained in Carrano et al.'s matrix, it takes only one extra
step to place it in Carcharodontosauridae, showing either position is
about as likely. It takes 7 more steps to make it a spinosaurid, so
this is less probable.<br>

Porfiri et al. (2014) listed numerous characters dissimilar to other
megaraptorans, though they did not include it in an analysis or propose
a precise alternative reletionship, merely stating "<i>Siats</i>
lacks clear derived characters linking it with Megaraptora, and even
Coelurosauria." Resolution will require an analysis including all of
the proposed characters.  Most recently, Rauhut et al. (2024) used
the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix to recover it as a

is distinct from <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>
based on- "lateral pleurocoels in the centrum, pneumatic fossae related
to the transverse process or the base of the neural spine, or pneumatic
foramina within the pre- and postspinal fossae," "caudal centra with an
articular surface in contour, being dorsoventrally taller that
transversely wide (vs. the subcircular-shaped articular surface in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>;
Figure 11b); not flared articular surfaces, resulting in flat lateral
surfaces of centrum (vs. flared articular surfaces with notably
longitudinally concave surfaces of centrum in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>; Figure 11b); strongly
transversely convex ventral surface of centrum (vs. flat in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>), and absence of
transversely sub-horizontal shelf connecting both postzygapophyses (vs.
present and prominent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>;
Figure 11b″)", transverse processes placed within neural arch, mid
caudal prezygapophyses "short and strongly dorsally oriented" with
shorter articular surfaces, "postzygapophyses of mid-caudals are
notably reduced to a very small articular surface located in the
posterior corner of the neural arch", prespinal fossae "well-developed,
deep, notably longer than wide and sub-quadrangular in contour" and
"well-developed and deep" postspinal fossae.  However, pleurocoels
are only present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aoniraptor</span>
on its first caudal (not those preserved more distally in <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span>),
the tranverse flaring of articular ends is not that different, and
differences in transverse ventral convexity cannot be confirmed with
published data.  Despite these caveats the other differences are
quite real and Aranciaga Rolando et al. (2022) found that using Novas'

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Azuma and Currie, 2000) narrow dentary (~30%
of depth) (also in <i>Eotyrannus</i>); teeth with oblique blood
grooves (also in <i>Megalosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids); ulnohumeral
ratio &gt;90%.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of the other diagnostic characters listed by
Azuma and Currie (2000), fused interdental plates are also present in <i>Fukuiraptor</i>
and <i>Eotyrannus</i>. Larger hands with better developed unguals than
<i>Allosaurus</i> and a tall astragalar ascending process are primitive
for coelurosaurs. The supposedly broader than long pubic peduncle of
the ilium is based on what is probably an ornithopod pubis (see below).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The supposed ilium is more probably a <i>Fukuisaurus</i>
pubis (Jansma, pers. comm. 2004).<br>
The first discovered element of <i>Fukuiraptor</i> may be a tooth from
the type quarry nicknamed Tsuchikura-ryu by Azuma (1991) and referred
to Megalosauridae. Currie and Azuma (2006) note 89% of the teeth from
that quarry are from <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, whose teeth do possess the
generalized carnosaur/megalosaur morphology. While several other
Japanese nicknames have been inappropriately transformed into nomina
nuda in the published literature, "Tsuchikurasaurus" is so far
restricted to the internet, specifically due to the IVPP's dinosaur.net
site. <br>
In 1991, jaw fragments were found in the quarry and identified as
dromaeosaurid based on their fused interdental plates. This was
followed by the discovery of a manual ungual I, astragalus and
metatarsal III in 1993. Azuma and Currie (1995) described these remains
in an abstract as those of a giant dromaeosaurid, which was associated
in the paleontological community with the name "Kitadanisaurus" through
the late 1990's. Azuma and Currie (2000) later described the material
in more detail, along with more elements that made up a partial
skeleton. Their new taxon <i>Fukuiraptor</i> was identified as a basal
carnosaur instead of a dromaeosaurid, though dromaeosaurid material is
known from the quarry (including the original "Kitadanisaurus" tooth).
Thus "Kitadanisaurus" is not a synonym of <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, contra
Olshevsky (DML 2000).<br>
Most of the elements listed under 'holotype' were found associated in
one small area of the Kitadani quarry. The left humerus was given the
separate call number FPMN 96082443. The paratype maxillary fragment,
dentary fragment, nine teeth, cervical centrum and neural arch which
fits it, dorsal neural arch and coracoid were found in the same level,
but in different areas of the quarry. They are all the right size to
belong to the holotype, but this can not be proven. At least fourteen
individuals are preserved in the type quarry, based on femoral number.
The more similar-sized pairs of femora possibly belong to single
individuals (99090901 and 980813017; 9812638 and 97080937; 970730003
and 97120001; 98081028 and 98120001). The provisionally referred femora
are similar to <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and not obviously dromaeosaurid.
Several other specimens (humerus, manual phalanx I-1, three manual
unguals, three tibiae, pedal phalanx III-2) were found in the quarry.
Some are not referrable to <i>Fukuiraptor</i> (a straight manual
ungual and humerus), but others may be. Novas et al. (2013) suggested
only the more recurved teeth with mesial serrations limited to the apex
were referrable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span>,
with the others being carcharodontosaurid. Yet there are intermediate
morphologies (e.g. FPDM-V97082728), so that Currie and Azuma's
identification of teeth with limited mesial serrations as anterior
teeth (vs. posterior teeth with extensive mesial serrations) seems
likely. <br>
Azuma and Currie (2000) found <i>Fukuiraptor</i> to be a basal
carnosaur in their phylogenetic analysis, as did Holtz (2001) and Holtz
et al. (2004). Hucknull et al. (2009) found it to be a
non-carcharodontosaurid carnosaur more derived than <i>Sinraptor</i>,
while Benson (2010) placed it as the sister group of Avetheropoda.
Benson et al. (2010) added more characters and taxa to Benson's earlier
analysis and found <i>Fukuiraptor</i> was in their new clade
Megaraptora within Carcharodontosauridae, sister to <i>Australovenator</i>. 
Longrich (2001) in placed it as a very basal coelurosaur, presaging
Novas et al. (2013) and derivatives that recover Megaraptora even
deeper within Coelurosauria as tyrannosauroids.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- UNPSJB-PV 944 was
found in 1989 and UNPSJB-PV 958 in 1998.  They were first
announced by
Martinez et al. (1999) as a theropod of uncertain affinities, with
manual ungual I of UNPSJB-PV 958 confused for pedal ungual II as was
the case for <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>'s
holotype.  The ungual was said to be similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>, but metatarsal II "much
more massive than metatarsal III of <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>,
suggesting heavier construction of the pes."  By 2004, Lamanna et
al. had referred these specimens to <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>
in an SVP abstract, while Lamanna (2004) described them in detail in
his thesis as <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>
sp. indet..  Lamanna et al. (2020) puiblished a detailed
description of
them as Megaraptoridae gen. et sp. indet., noting "comparisons of
elements that overlap between UNPSJB-PV 944 and UNPSJB-PV 958 (middle
caudal vertebrae, manual unguals I and III, metatarsal II) strongly
suggest that both specimens pertain to the same species" but that "due
to their highly fragmentary nature, we refrain from assigning UNPSJB-PV
944 and UNPSJBPV 958 to an existing megaraptorid genus or species or
erecting a new taxon to receive them."  The dorsal vertebra of 944
was
reidentified as a third or fourth instead of first, and caudal
vertebrae of 958 were newly identified.  Added to Novas'
tetanurine
analysis, Lamanna et al. recovered the composite 944/958 OTU as a
megaraptorid basal to named taxa but more derived than cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rapator</span> LRF 100-106.<br>
Huene (1929) assigned a caudal centrum to an otherwise unknown group of
theropods, derived in having caudal pleurocoels. Mendez et al. (2012)
noted strong resemblences to their new Brazilian megaraptoran caudal
MPMA 08-003-94, showing Huene was correct. <br>
Casal et al. (2009) describe three teeth as Dromaeosauridae, strongly
recurved and lacking mesial serrations.  Ibiricu et al. (2020)
later
referred these to Megaraptora indet..<br>

presence of a shallow pit and an alar projection on the dorsal surface

<b>Comments</b>- Pigdon (DML 1998) noted a supposedly dromaeosaurid
ulna had been reported in the 1998 Flat Rocks Site Report, mentioned by
Rich and Rich. Pidgon states (pers comm., 2007) that Rich and Rich had
forgotten about suggesting a dromaeosaurid identity and that it may be
the ulna photographed in Rich and Vickers-Rich (2003) and identified
merely as theropod. Salisbury et al. (2007) stated it compared
favorably to <i>Megaraptor</i>, which was expanded on in Smith et
al.'s (2008) description and phylogenetic analysis. They referred it to
cf. <i>Megaraptor</i> based on two characters- proximocaudally
expanded blade-like olecranon process that extends distally as a caudal
olecranon crest; pronounced lateral tuberosity that is continuous
distally with a distinct lateral crest. Benson et al. (2010) claimed
they were potentially more widespread within megaraptorans, referring
the ulna to Neovenatoridae indet.. The proximocaudally expanding
olecranon is indeed shared with <i>Australovenator</i> (but not <i>Fukuiraptor</i>),
and the lateral tuberosity is even larger in <i>Australovenator</i>
(unpreserved in <i>Fukuiraptor</i>). However, even if the blade-like
olecranon is due to crushing as they say, the posterior olecranon crest
is absent in <i>Australovenator</i> and <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, and the
lateral crest emerging from the lateral tuberosity is absent in <i>Australovenator</i>
at least. Thus pending further study, NMV V186076 is closer to <i>Megaraptor</i>
than to other megaraptorans known from ulnae, but how it compares to <i>Aerosteon</i>
or <i>Orkoraptor</i> is unknown. <br>
Although referred to Spinosauridae in its original description, Novas
et al. (2013) questioned this and only retained NMV P221081 as

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (suggested) astragalar ascending process tall as in
other coelurosaurs; astragalar ascending process is primitively
restricted to the lateral body compared to <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Australovenator</i>
and other coelurosaurs except <i>Coelurus</i>. Differs from <i>Coelurus</i>
in plesiomorphically having a bulbous medial condyle in anterior view.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of the characters listed by Molnar et al.
(1980), the astragalus does not seem more robust than <i>Fukuiraptor</i>.
The absence of a pit on the posterior base of the astragalar ascending
process is primitive. Many other taxa such as <i>Torvosaurus</i>, <i>Sinraptor</i>,
<i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Australovenator</i>, <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>
have the vertical groove on the posterior face of the ascending process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Chure (2000) is the first person to publish the name <i>Allosaurus</i>
"robustus", previously confined to a museum label. Names in theses
aren't usually listed in this website, and this one is only because it
was later published by Glut (2003). Glut's work includes a caveat to
the effect that it is not available to establish new taxonomy however,
so the name remains unofficial. <br>
Molnar et al. (1981) initially described this specimen as <i>Allosaurus</i>
sp., which was disputed by Welles (1983) who argued it resembled
'ornithomimoid' tarsi more. Molnar et al. (1983) countered Welles,
though no other supposed allosaurid genera were compared in either of
Molnar et al.'s works. In addition, Welles' 'ornithomimoid' type refers
to a grade of tarsus encompassing Maniraptoriformes, and not
ornithomimosaurs in particular. Chure (1998) again disputed an
allosaurid relationship in an abstract, though he acknowledged it could
be allosauroid. This was elaborated on in Chure's (2000) thesis, where
he assigns it to Avetheropoda, but not Allosauridae. The resolution of
"robustus"' identity occured when Azuma and Currie (2000) described
their new supposed basal carnosaur <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, which has an
extremely similar astragalus. Subsequently, Hocknull et al. (2009)
found their new supposed basal carcharodontosaurid <i>Australovenator</i>
was extremely similar to <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and "robustus" as well,
referring the latter to <i>Australovenator</i> sp.. Benson et al.
(2010) agreed these three taxa were closely related, creating the clade
Megaraptora for them and viewing "robustus" as an indeterminate member.
Comparing all three taxa, the ascending process reaches further
laterally and angles more laterally in <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and
"robustus" than in <i>Australovenator</i>. The ascending process is
pointed and 20% taller in <i>Fukuiraptor</i> than <i>Australovenator</i>
or "robustus". It reaches further medially in <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and <i>Australovenator</i>
compared to "robustus". The ventomedial angle of the astragalar body is
intermediate in <i>Fukuiraptor</i> between <i>Australovenator</i> and
"robustus". In both <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and "robustus", the transverse
condylar groove angles dorsomedially, whereas it angles ventromedially
in <i>Australovenator</i>. <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and <i>Australovenator</i>
have a shorter straight lateroventral edge to the astragalar body. Thus
there seems no reason to believe "robustus" is closer to <i>Australovenator</i>
than to <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, besides provenance. As Megaraptora has
recently been placed in both Allosauroidea and Coelurosauria by
different authors, Molnar's and Welles' early arguments were each
prescient and Chure's compromise accurate.<br>
Agnolin et al. (2005) argued "robustus" was probably an abelisauroid,
which was officially published by Agnolin et al. (2010). They argued
several characters support this. They claim the ascending process lacks
apical tapering, but both "robustus" and <i>Australovenator</i> have a
roughly parallel basal portion and a tapered apical portion created by
a medal slope. The difference is one of degree, where the slope in
"robustus" is longer. A vertical groove on the posterior ascending
process' surface probably corresponds to the ridge found in the middle
of the process' articular surface in some abelisauroid tibiae. The
ridge has since been identified in numerous tetanurines including the
megaraptoran <i>Aerosteon</i>, and both <i>Australovenator</i> and <i>Fukuiraptor</i>
exhibit the groove. The anterior ridge along the lateral ascending
process' edge is caused by the fibula articulating along that edge.
This was originally thought to be an <i>Allosaurus</i> character by
Molnar et al., and said to be present in <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i> by
Agnolin et al., but is found in several other theropods including <i>Fukuiraptor</i>
as well. Finally, their 2010 paper argued "robustus" has a broad
posterior ascending process peaking near the middle of the astragalar
body, but according to Molnar et al.'s original stereophotos, this is a
misinterpretation. Instead, the labeled "plap" is merely the posterior
wall of the normal ascending process, and the lower medially placed
posterior ascending process is like that in <i>Fukuiraptor</i> and <i>Australovenator</i>.
I conclude there is no reason to doubt "robustus"' megaraptoran
placement, and similar arguments were made by Fitzgerald et al. (2012).

condyle with ventral surface width ~46% of condylar depth; metatarsal
II medial condyle dorsal surface ~73% as wide as surface of lateral
condyle and angled 35 degrees from lateral edge of lateral condyle.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note the description was actually published in 1915,
though the volume was intended for 1914. The holotype was discovered in
1912 and deposited in what was then the Geological Museum of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in Petrograd (Tolmachoff, 1924) (now St.
Petersburg), which has since moved to Moscow. Riabinin (1915; partially
translated in Chure, 2000) named it <i>Allosaurus (?) sibiricus</i>
based on what he identified as a distal metatarsal IV. Huene (1932)
said only that it did not permit exact characterization and probably
belonged to an allosaurid (he renamed it <i>Antrodemus? sibiricus</i>
as he thought that was a senior synonym of <i>Allosaurus</i>). Molnar
et al. (1981) felt <i>sibiricus</i> resembled <i>Ceratosaurus</i> so
closely that they "hesitate to accept it as an allosaurid". Molnar et
al. (1990) on the other hand stated it was "almost identical with that
of <i>C. tashuikouensis</i> in form and proportions of the distal
condyle", so questionably referred it to <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>.
Nessov (1995) agreed the species were similar and that <i>sibiricus</i>
may belong in <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>. He noted stratigraphic data gave
three possible formations the specimen was discovered in. Chure (2000)
incorrectly said Riabinin did not illustrate the material, as he
apparently had only a small portion of the original document. This
error was repeated by Benson and Xu (2008). Chure excluded it from
Allosauridae because he believed the distal outline was rectangular,
but it is actually trapezoidal in both <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>sibiricus</i>.
Both Benson and Xu and Carrano et al. (2012) incorrectly credited Holtz
et al. (2004) as being responsible for assigning it to <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>,
though Carrano et al. correctly identified it as a second metatarsal.
They believed it "too fragmentary to be assigned to a known taxon or
identified as a distinct form" and noted similarity to <i>Allosaurus</i>,
<i>Neovenator</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i> and <i>Afrovenator</i> (though
no metatarsal II has been reported for the latter).<br>
Ivanov (1940) reported a bone referred to <i>Allosaurus sibiricus</i>
from the Mortoi Formation, though without more data this referral is
uncertain.<br>
The holotype is ~70% the size of <i>Chilantaisaurus tashuikouensis</i>
in distal width and depth, which would make it ~286 mm if similarly
stout. If from an elongate metatarsus like <i>Australovenator</i>'s
though, it would be ~398 mm long. It differs from <i>Allosaurus</i> in
having a more medially oriented dorsal curve to the lateral condyle,
having a larger and more medially flaring medial condyle, having a
lateral condyle which is recessed ventrally, and lacking the lateral
flare on the ventral edge of <i>Allosaurus</i>' lateral condyle. <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>'
medial condyle flares slightly more than <i>Allosaurus</i>' and it has
a ventrally recessed lateral condyle, but it has the small medial
condyle and a lateral flare like <i>Allosaurus</i> and has the dorsal
curve oriented even further laterally. Of course, Riabinin and Molnar
et al. were comparing <i>sibiricus</i> with the fourth metatarsals of <i>Ceratosaurus</i>,
<i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>, not the second
metatarsals (both fourth metatarsals differ from <i>sibiricus</i> in
having a ventrally pointed medial condyle and lacking a ventrally inset
medial condyle, while <i>Allosaurus</i>' element is much narrower, and
<i>Chilantaisaurus</i>' has a larger dorsolateral bulge; Molnar et al.
were correct that <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>' is more similar, but it is
not almost identical). Taxa with similarly medially flaring medial
condyles are <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i>, <i>Sinraptor</i>,
<i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Australovenator</i>, <i>Megaraptor</i>
and <i>Harpymimus</i>, though only <i>Australovenator</i>'s and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>'
are close in size. Taxa with a ventrally inset lateral margin are <i>Rajasaurus</i>,
<i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Australovenator</i>,
<i>Megaraptor</i>, <i>Appalachiosaurus</i> and <i>Alxasaurus</i>.
Overall, it is most similar to <i>Australovenator</i>, differing in
being 9% broader compared to depth, a broader lateral condyle
ventrally, and having a more medially oriented dorsal surface of the
lateral condyle. Next most similar is <i>Megaraptor</i>, which it
differs from in having a broader lateral condyle ventrally with ventral
surface angled more laterally, and a less rounded dorsal surface of the
lateral condyle. The amount of ventral inset of the lateral condyle and
dorsal exposure of the medial condyle is in between these two taxa.
This suggests <i>sibiricus</i> may be a megaraptoran, which is
congruent with its age, size and location. As it is intermediate in two
variables, more similar to <i>Megaraptor</i> in depth, more similar to
<i>Australovenator</i> in the orientation of the lateral condyle's
ventral surface, and differs from both in the lateral condyle's ventral
width, placing it in any named genus is not possible. As it does differ
from all known theropod metatarsals, it is not a nomen dubium, contra
Rauhut (2003), Holtz et al. and Carrano et al..<br>

(after White et al., 2013) differs from <i>Australovenator</i> in-
less tapered proximomedial process; more laterally concave distal

angling; medial condyle angled less transversely; deeper trochlea both
distally and ventrally; dorsal longitudinal ridge proximal to medial
condyle; medial condyle transversely compressed in ventral view; more

(after Bell et al., 2016) proximal end of metatarsal III strongly
asymmetrical in medial/lateral view with trapezoidal anterior process
extending further distally along the shaft than the posterior process
giving a ball-peen hammer-shaped profile; contact for metatarsal II on
metatarsal III divided into anterior and posterior halves by shallow,
longitudinal groove.<br>
Differs from <i>Australovenator</i> in- more robust anterior process
on ulna; more gracile manual ungual I with sharply defined median ridge
on proximal articular surface; prominent, broad groove between
articular facet and flexor tubercle on manual ungual I (also in <i>Megaraptor</i>);
metatarsal III with well-developed lateral ridge on proximal shaft;
distal articular surface of metatarsal III as wide as it is long.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Originally identified as a compsognathid metacarpal I
similar to <i>Ornitholestes</i> and <i>Oviraptor</i> (Huene, 1932),
Molnar (1992) suggested it was an abelisaurid based on biogeography.
Headden (DML, 2000) later noticed similarities between it and
alvarezsaurid phalanx I-1, which was the conclusion published by Holtz
et al. (2004). Salisbury et al. (2007) stated it may belong to a <i>Nqwebasaurus</i>-like
basal coelurosaur, presumably as a metacarpal I once more. Agnolin et
al. (2010) confirmed it was a first metacarpal but found it to be most
similar to <i>Megaraptor</i> and <i>Australovenator</i>, especially
the latter. They incorrectly called it a nomen dubium, despite saying
it and <i>Australovenator</i> differ from <i>Megaraptor</i> in having
a more dorsoventrally developed mediodistal condyle and a metacarpal II
facet lying in almost the same plane as the lateral margin of the
shaft, and that it differs from <i>Australovenator</i> in several
other features. Agnolin et al. made it a nomen dubium because of its
fragmentary condition (irrelevant), the absence of autapomorphies
(irrelevant given the unique combination of characters) and absence of
clear differences with <i>Australovenator</i> (which could only make
it a senior synonym of the latter, as no other taxon was presented as
having no/subtle differences from <i>Rapator</i>). White et al. (2013)
explicitly compared the two genera based on a more complete metacarpal
I of <i>Australovenator</i> and digital scans of each, finding <i>Rapator</i>
differs in numerous details. The authors viewed these as "sufficient
differences to warrant assignment to separate genera", but this seems
premature without analyzing variation in other taxa. The genera are
kept separate here due to the combination of morphological and
stratigraphic difference.<br>
Bell et al. (2016) described a fragmentary postcranium from the same
formation as <i>Rapator</i>. They referred to this as Megaraptoridae
indet., though listed several characters distinguishing it from <i>Australovenator</i>
and other megaraptorids. Given the locality and lack of megaraptoran
diversity in other formations, this specimen is here provisionally
referred to <i>Rapator</i> although it cannot be directly compared
since metacarpal I is unpreserved.<br>
Brougham et al. (2019) described caudal AM F112816 as Megaraptora
indet. based on its pneumaticity.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Hocknull et al., 2009) at least eighteen
[nineteen based on White et al., 2015] dentary teeth (also in <i>Compsognathus</i>);
dorsal ribs with pneumatic cavities (also in <i>Aerosteon</i>);
olecranon process inflated in proximal view; round and discontinuous
lateral tuberosity on ulna; distal extensor groove deep and narrow
(also in <i>Bagaraatan</i> and <i>Xiongguanlong</i>); ventral process
on anterior edge of lateral tibial condyle; proximal articular surface
of fibula bevelled to be higher anteriorly (also in <i>Scipionyx</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hocknull et al. (2009) also included several
characters which are primitive for coelurosaurs- gracile dentary;
dentary with subparallel dorsal and ventral margins; rounded dentary
symphysis, chin absent on dentary; primary row of dentary neurovascular
foramina not decurved posteriorly; gastralia unfused; gastralia
distally tapered; ulna straight; femoral flexor groove lacks cruciate
ridge; lateral malleolus of tibia extends distal of medial malleolus;
medial astragalar condyle transversely expanded; astragalus with tall
ascending process; anterior groove across astragalar condyles; groove
at base of astragalar ascending process; metatarsals elongate and
gracile. Others are also present in <i>Fukuiraptor</i>- fused
interdental plates; anterolateral groove on ulnar shaft; anterior
trochanter extends proximally to near proximal greater trochanter edge;
anterolateral process projects from antero proximal margin of
astragalar lateral condyle. The general trend of a quadrangular first
dentary alveolus, followed by several cicular alveoli and then
transversely compressed alveoli is common in theropods. A dorsally
directed femoral head is also present in <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>, <i>Gasosaurus</i>,
<i>Bagaraatan</i> and tyrannosauroids. An anteromedially directed
femoral head is also present in <i>Megaraptor, Tugulusaurus</i> and <i>Xiongguanlong</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- White et al. (2012) redescribed the forelimb including
many new elements, finding a supposed distal manual ungual II to be an
incomplete pedal ungual I, supposed manual phalanx II-2 is III-1, and
supposed right metacarpal II is from the left side. Similarly, White et
al. (2013) redescribed the hindlimb elements, finding metatarsal I is
from the left side, and that some pedal phalanges were incorrectly
identified. White et al. (2015) described a newly described dentary of
the holotype, believed the isolated teeth found with the holotype were
not referrable to that individual, and referred additional teeth from
other localities.<br>
Discovered in 2018,
White et al. (2020) stated "the close proximity and size congruence of
the specimens recovered from AODL 261 suggests that they pertain to a
single individual."  The authors felt "the identification of the
AODL
261 material as megaraptorid lies principally on the presence of
pleurocoels on the two incomplete caudal centra" and that "The distal
end of metatarsal II (AODF 978) also bears some resemblance to that of
a specimen assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>
sp. (UNPSJB-PV 944) and to a lesser extent <span style="font-style: italic;">Australovenator</span>."  It is
tentatively listed under <span style="font-style: italic;">Australovenator</span>
here due to provenance.<br>
Hocknull et al. (2009) included <i>Australovenator</i> in the
carnosaur analysis of Brusatte and Sereno (2008) and found it emerges
as the basalmost carcharodontosaurid. However, this did not include the
astragalar characters they note are shared with <i>Fukuiraptor</i>,
nor any coelurosaurs except Compsognathidae. Benson et al. (2010) using
a larger dataset found it to be a megaraptoran carcharodontosaurid, but
again included few coelurosaurs.  While this position within
Megaraptora is now well established, the placement of that clade is
still controversial.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Coria and Currie (2016) state "there are a number of unprepared and
undescribed bones (MCF-PVPH-80) that were collected in association with
MCF-PVPH-079, including four caudal vertebrae, two ribs (one almost
complete), and gastralia. This cluster of fossils was found far enough
from the material described as the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor namunhuaiquii</span>
that the collectors could not be sure whether or not they belonged to
the same specimen (Novas, personal communication 2004)."  
Additionally, "one almost complete dorsal rib would have been found
associated with MCF-PVPH 79 (Novas, personal communication 2006)" and
all of these materials plus "a medial fragment of the distal end of the
right tibia" are described as MCF-PVPH-079.  <br>
Lammana et al. (2020) state "the complete right metatarsal IV assigned
to MUCPv 341 by Calvo et al. (2004) is substantially shorter than would
be expected for this animal.  Given that this metatarsal was
recovered at least 3.5 m away from all other bones that comprise this
specimen (see Calvo et al. 2004:567), we suspect that it may pertain to
a different theropod individual. More specifically, based on its
possession of several probable megaraptorid synapomorphies" it "may
indicate the presence of a fourth, smaller individual in the quarry
(Porfiri pers. comm. to MCL)."<br>
The teeth mentioned by Poblete and Calvo (2003) are labiolingually
compressed teeth with strongly posteriorly inclined crowns which are
sometimes proportionally short. They lack mesial serrations but have
distal ones. A labial carina is present, continuing apically to the tip
of the distal side. It sometimes has small serrations.  Gianechini
et
al. (2011) states they are similar to Bajo de la Carpa tooth MPCA 247
which has been recognized as megaraptorid.<br>
This was first reported by Novas et al. (1996) in an abstract as a
possibly maniraptoran tetanurine. Originally thought to have an
enlarged hyperextensible pedal ungual II, a newer specimen (Calvo et
al., 2002) shows this is actually manual ungual I. Calvo et al. (2004)
suggested <i>Megaraptor</i> was a non-avetheropod tetanurine, though
without an analysis to back it up. Lamanna (2004) entered it in
Rauhut's analysis and found it to be an allosauroid carnosaur. Smith et
al. (2007) recovered <i>Megaraptor</i> as a carcharodontosaurine in
their analysis, then later (2008) as the sister taxon of Spinosauridae.
Benson (2010) recovered it as a carnosaur or sister taxon to
Avetheropoda, but when more characters and taxa were added (Benson et
al., 2010), it formed part of a larger clade within
Carcharodontosauridae they named Megaraptora (closest to <i>Aerosteon</i>
within that clade). Carrano et al. (2012) also recover it as a
megaraptoran carcharodontosaurid, and as it takes 12 more steps to
force it into Carcharodontosaurinae and 15 more steps to force it into
Megalosauroidea, the latter two options are improbable. Most recently,
Novas et al. (2013) and Porfiri et al. (2014) have recovered
Megaraptora within Tyrannosauroidea, in part due to the <i>Dilong</i>-like
skull of MUCPv 595.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in 2001, Coria and Currie (2002) and Paulina-Carabajal
(2009) assign this specimen to Coelurosauria, the latter describing its
braincase in detail (eventually published as Paulina-Carabajal and
Currie, 2017). Novas et al. (2013) propose a megaraptoran affinity and
Paulina-Carabajal and Coria (2015) refer to it as a "probable
megaraptorid." The specimen was finally described in detail by Coria
and Currie (2016) as <i>Murusraptor</i>,
recovered as a megaraptorid in a version of Carrano et al.'s tetanurine
analysis and as a megaraptoran in Novas et al.'s tetanurine analysis.
Note the quadratojugal, palatine, hyoids and cervical vertebrae
reported in 2001 must have been misidentified as they are not present
in the final description, and that the sediments were reassigned from
the Plottier Formation to the Sierra Barrosa Formation.  Poropat
et al. (2019) said regarding the dentition that "personal observation
of these teeth (by S.F.P., 2018) revealed a high degree of size and
morphological disparity - it is probable that they derive from more
than one megaraptorid individual and that non-megaraptorid theropod
teeth are also present in the sample."<br>

(MCNA-PV-3139) tibia, incomplete fibula, astragalus, calcaneum (Sereno,
Martinez, Wilson, Varricchio, Alcober and Larsson, 2009)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified after Sereno et al., 2008) prefrontal with
a very short ventral process; enlarged paraquadrate foramen located
entirely within the quadrate; large tympanic diverticulum into the
quadrate shaft above the articular condyle; anterior dorsal vertebra
with very large parapophyses; dorsal neural spines with central
pneumatic space (also in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>); posteriormost
dorsal vertebra with anterodorsally inclined neural spine;
posteriormost dorsal vertebra with a pneumatic canal within the
transverse process (also in <i>Neovenator</i>); medial gastral
elements coossified with anterior and posterior flanges; furcula with
median pneumatocoel.<br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) robust, cylindrical transverse processes
on proximal caudal vertebrae; fossa on lateral surface of coracoid
dorsal to glenoid and (separate) subglenoid fossa.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Aerosteon</i>
was originally named in the online-only publication PLoS ONE on
September 30 2008, which did not satisfy the ICZN's requirement (then
Article 8.6, since ammended) that publications be printed on paper and
"contain a statement that copies (in the form in which it is published)
have been deposited in at least 5 major publicly accessible libraries
which are identified by name in the work itself." This requirement was
only met on May 21 2009 (PLoS ONE, 2009 online), making <i>Aerosteon</i>
a nomen nudum until that time.<br>
Although originally thought to derive from the Campanian Anacleto
Formation, Novas et al. (2013) determined it is actually from the Late
Coniacian Plottier Formation. <br>
Benson et al. (2010) tried running the referred hindlimb MCNA-PV-3139
as a separate OTU, and it also grouped with megaraptorans, suggesting
it is properly referred to <i>Aerosteon</i>.
The identity of the referred metatarsal and associated pes
(MCNA-PV-3138) is less certain. Novas et al. (2013) listed megaraptoran
manual unguals from the same locality which probably belong to the
taxon, though they considered the tooth found with the holotype to be
dubious and perhaps abelisaurid.  Hendrickx et al. (2020) tested
this and recovered it as an abelisaurid using cladsitic analyses, so it
is here excluded from the holotype<br>
This taxon was originally referred to Carcharodontosauridae by Alcober
et al. (1998), and later as a carnosaur most similar to <i>Allosaurus</i>
(Sereno et al., 2009). Benson et al. (2010) are the first to include <i>Aerosteon</i>
in a phylogenetic analysis, and found it to be a carcharodontosaurid in
their new clade Megaraptora, closest to <i>Megaraptor</i>
itself.  While this position within Megaraptora is now well
established, the placement of that clade is still controversial.<br>

January and March 2019, Novas et al. (2019) described MPM 21545 as
Megaraptoridae gen. et sp. indet. 1 based on several elements
(thirteenth dorsal centrum, dorsal transverse
process, dorsal rib fragments, ~tenth caudal neural arch, two
vertebral fragments, proximal pubis).  They assigned it to
Megaraptoridae based on paired dorsal pleurocoels separated by septum
and anterior and posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae on
the proximal caudal.  Aranciaga Rolando et al. described
additional remains of the specimen and proposed naming it "Maip
macrothorax", originally online on December 22 2021 as a preprint under
consideration at Scientific Reports (although
publically available on ResearchSquare) and thus a nomen nudum not
intended as a
permanent scientific record (ICZN Article 8.1.1).  The official
paper was published in Scientific Reports on April 26 2022.  Note
while Aranciaga Rolando et al. (2022) refer to a distal metatarsal II
described by Novas et al.,
the latter mention no such element although it is possible Aranciaga
Rolando et al. meant the supposed dorsal transverse process end that
they
otherwise don't mention.  The presence of exposed camellae shows
this
is clearly an axial element however, as Mesozoic theropod metatarsals
are not pneumatic.  Aranciaga Rolando et al. used Novas'
tetanurine analysis to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Maip</span>

Holotype</b>- (MPM-Pv 3457) (~7 m) postorbital, quadratojugal (82 mm),
coronoid(?), eight teeth, atlantal intercentrum, fragmentary atlantal
neurapophysis, eight fragmentary ribs, two proximal (~3-4) caudal
vertebrae (90 mm), three incomplete chevrons, proximal tibia (~700 mm)<br>
<b>Paratype</b>- (MPM-Pv 3458) three teeth<br>
<b>Referred</b>- ?(MPM-Pv 10004) incomplete fibula (Ramirez and Bazcko,
2009)<br>
(MPM-Pv coll.) several teeth (Lacovara et al., 2014)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified after Novas et al., 2008) teeth with
unserrated and transversely wide mesial margins; teeth with a median
depression flanked by two longitudinal and narrow furrows on the
lingual surface; quadratojugal with a short jugal process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon was discovered in 2001 and announced in a
2004 abstract, but not described until 2008. Varela (2011) revised the
age and nomenclature of the formation <i>Orkoraptor</i> was found in,
which was later revised again by Novas et al. (2019). Contra Novas et
al.'s (2008) suggestion of a more distal placement for the caudals
(~14-18), their central proportions match those around caudals 3 and 4
of <i>Neovenator</i>. The illustrated chevron is probably around the
twentieth based on comparison to <i>Allosaurus</i>. Originally, Novas
et al. (2004) identified the coronoid as a nasal.<br>
Ramirez and Bazcko (2009) described MPM-PV 10004 briefly in an
abstract, stating its posteriorly closed proximomedial fibular fossa
and moderately developed iliofibularis tubercle were similar to
tetanurines. It was said to be less robust than carcharodontosaurids,
and most similar to megaraptorans and basal coelurosaurs like
tyrannosauroids, which given the recent referral of megaraptorans to
Coelurosauria may both be true. Finally, they noted it might be
referrable to <i>Orkoraptor</i> from the same formation, and indeed
its size (incomplete but &gt;639 mm) matches that genus' estimated
tibial length. Thus it is provisionally referred here. <br>
Novas et al. (2004) originally suggested relationships with
spinosaurids, <i>Megaraptor</i> and undescribed megaraptoran MCF-PVPH
411. Once described, Novas et al. (2008) found it to be a coelurosaur
most probably related to compsognathids or dromaeosaurids in their
version of the TWG analysis. The postorbital is almost identical to <i>Aerosteon</i>,
a supposed carnosaur that also has proximal caudal pleurocoels. Benson
et al. (2010) found it to be a member of their newly formed
carcharodontosaurid clade Megaraptora, though with an uncertain
position within that group. Recent analyses by Novas et al. (2013) and
Porfiri et al. (2014) which place Megaraptora inside Tyrannosauroidea
could work with all of these hypotheses.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype was
discovered
in 2006 and initially reported by Porfiri et al. (2008) as "a new large
basal tetanuran taxon, possibly an allosauroid related to the
Carcharodontosauridae."  Novas et al. (2013) suggested it may be
megaraptoran based on the "complex pneumatic dorsal and sacral
vertebrae with tall neural spines inclined forward."  Porfiri et
al. (2018) described this as a
megaraptorid using Novas et al.'s tetanurine analysis.  <br>
Coria and Arcucci (2004) described MCF-PVPH-399 and 418 as Theropoda
indet., suggesting they were basal tetanurines but noting a a lack of
carcahrodontosaurid apomorphies. 
Baiano and Coria (2018) reanalyzed the material, finding "in light of
current knowledge, it would be possible to fine-tune the identification
of these elements as Megaraptora indet."<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R178) (~2 mm) first sacral vertebra (25 mm),
second sacral vertebra (29 mm), third sacral vertebra (24 mm), fourth
sacral vertebra (23 mm), fifth sacral vertebra (21 mm), distal pubes<br>
<b>Paratypes</b>- ....(NHMUK R178a) dorsal vertebra (21 mm)<br>
....(NHMUK R178b) two incomplete distal caudal vertebrae (28 mm)<br>
....(NHMUK R179) incomplete manual ungual<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The type material was discovered in 1866 (Naish, 2002;
Blows, 1983), though not described by Owen until a decade later as a
new species of <i>Poekilopleuron</i>. As Fox (in Blows, 1983) wrote
the bones "were found in the compass of a dinner plate", the paratypes
probably belong to the same individual as the holotype. Cope (1878)
wrote "Owen has recently described an English species of <i>Laelaps</i>
under the name <i>Poecilopleuron minor</i>", which might be a mistake
as <i>pusillus</i> means 'very small'. <br>
Lydekker (1888) referred an additional manual ungual (NHMUK R899) to
the taxon, but Naish (2002) notes it has a low and distally positioned
flexor tubercle unlike the paratype ungual so may be from another
species. Galton (1973) referred both the tibia NHMUK R186 and proximal
femur NHMUK R5194 to <i>Aristosuchus</i>, but neither can be compared
to the type material and are more properly Coelurosauria incertae sedis
(though the tibia has been referred to Ornithomimosauria by Allain et
al., 2014). Naish (1999) described the tibia MIWG 5137 as possibly
being <i>Aristosuchus</i>. Hutt (2001) listed IWCMS 1995.208, MIWG
5823 and MIWG 5824 as <i>Aristosuchus</i> sp., but the specimens are
undescribed though the vertebrae may be comparable to the type
specimens. Naish (2002) illustrated partial ischium NHMUK R6426 as a
possible <i>Aristosuchus</i> specimen. Any of these specimens may be
referrable to <i>Aristosuchus</i>, which may also be synonymous with <i>Calamosaurus</i>
and/or <i>Calamospondylus</i>. <br>
Jurcsák (1982) referred a cervical vertebra and caudal centrum from the
Cornet Bauxite of Romania to <i>Aristosuchus</i> sp., but there is no
rationale for this and the specimens cannot be compared to the type.<br>
Traditionally considered a coelurid (Paul, 1988) or a compsognathid
(Naish et al., 2001), Hartman et al. (2019) were the first to analyze <span style="font-style: italic;">Aristosuchus</span> quantitatively and
found it emerges as a tyrannoraptoran excluded from Maniraptoriformes
and tyrannosauroids as close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span>.<br>

<b>Comments-</b> The holotype was discovered in 1970 and initially
announced by Gradzinski and Jerzykiewicz (1972) as a "coeluroid
dinosaur", but not described until 1996 by Osmólska. She placed it in
Avetheropoda and noted resemblences to supposed Iren Dabasu avimimid
femur PIN 2549-100, which has been subsequently identified as
troodontid. Csiki and Grigorescu (1998) remarked on similarities
between it, several European maniraptoriforms (<i>Elopteryx,
Heptasteornis, Bradycneme</i>) and supposed ceratosaur distal femur
FGGUB R.351 which is now thought to be a hadrosaurid metatarsal. Holtz
(2000) placed it outside Tyrannoraptora, but more derived than <i>Proceratosaurus,
Ornitholestes, Coelurus</i> and <i>Scipionyx</i>. Longrich (2001)
placed it in the Maniraptora in his unpublished analysis, in a
trichotomy with alvarezsaurids and avepectorans.  Coria et al.
(2002) refer it to the Troodontidae without discussion. Rauhut (2003)
found it to be a maniraptoran in a trichotomy with enigmosaurs and
paravians. Holtz (2004) resolves it as the basalmost tyrannosauroid.
Carr (2005) found it to be the sister taxon of <i>Bistahieversor</i>,
both being sister to Tyrannosauridae, based on cranial characters. When
the hindlimb characters in Carr (2005) are combined with these
(personal observation), <i>Bagaraatan</i> is resolved as an
albertosaurine sister to <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>. Finally, Brusatte
(2013) strongly suspects <i>Bagaraatan</i> is a chimaera of
tyrannosauroid and other coelurosaurian elements, which will be the
subject of a paper written by Makovicky, himself and others. Based on
general morphology and the above results, it may end up that the
mandible, vertebrae and pelvis are tyrannosauroid while the hindlimb is
troodontid.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Hu et al., 2016; note the chimaerical nature
makes these doubtful) teeth unrecurved and unserrated; tail short with
no more than 40 caudal vertebrae; forelimb long (fl/hl ratio 55%) due
to long ulna (u/h ratio 92%); metacarpal I short and rectangular, ~24%
length of metacarpal II; phalanx II-1 is most robust and longest in
manus; pedal digit III is longest, followed by IV then II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen is clearly a chimaera (first suggested
by Cau, online 2016; published by Hartman et al., 2019) as three humeri
are present. In addition, elements are generally placed to look
articulated even when anatomically incorrect- e.g. the scapulocoracoid
placed as a booted ischium, unguals I and II on the rightmost manus
which are each made from separate proximal and distal portions so that
the flexor tubercle is placed dorsally, pedal phalanx III-2 in both
feet is upside down despite being articulated. In the skull, it seems
likely the frontal is actually a rectangular bone ventral to the
parietal, the premaxilla is actually what's labeled as the dentary, and
that the true dentary is what's labeled as the premaxilla and maxilla.
But given the nature of the specimen and teeth placed posterior to the
parietal, the composition and theropod identity of the supposed skull
elements is in doubt. The pubis is placed backward, and the phalanges
are different lengths in each manus and pes, with manual phalanges
III-1 and III-2 having obscure articulations. This makes the
identification and association of any phalanges doubtful, so that e.g.
the microraptorian-like manual unguals II or apparently elongate pedal
phalanges IV-4 are unlikely to be correctly interpreted characters of
whichever basal coelurosaurs the scapulocoracoid, humerus and
antebrachium, pubis and metatarsus belong to. Of those elements, the
humerus is very similar to <i>Ornitholestes</i>, while the pubis
resembles <i>Coelurus</i>. <i>Beipiaognathus</i> is thus placed near
to these taxa in the cladogram here, though additional study will be
necessary to the attribution of each element and which if any deserve
lectotype status.<br>

by Paul (1988) and Molnar (pers. comm. to Norman, 1990) based on the
tibia's slender proportions, but these are seen in many other small
coelurosaurs as well. As most coelurosaur tibiae still have proximal
tarsals attached, comparison is usually limited to the shape of the
lateral and medial edges and of the astragalar ascending process. In
addition to <i>Avimimus</i>, such varied taxa as <i>Garudimimus</i>
and <i>Achillobator</i> approach the basic outline of <i>Kakuru</i>'s
tibia. The height of <i>Kakuru</i>'s ascending process is
characteristic of tyrannoraptorans, though megaraptorans and noasaurids
approach it. The width to depth ratio in distal view is at least as
high as abelisauroids and tetanurines, but lower than maniraptorans or <i>Coelurus</i>.
Most coelurosaurs' ascending processes are more extensive medially,
except for <i>Tugulusaurus</i> and basal ornithomimosaurs and
alvreazsauroids. The strongly pointed ascending process is only rivaled
by <i>Shuvuuia</i>'s and <i>Garudimimus</i>', though <i>Kakuru</i>
lacks the medial notch characteristic of alvarezsaurid and basal
ornithomimosaur ascending processes. Rauhut (2005) argued for an
abelisauroid identity (echoed by Salisbury et al., 2007) based on the
anterior ridge extending vertically medial to the ascending process, as
seen in <i>Quilmesaurus</i>, <i>Masiakasaurus</i> and <i>Velocisaurus</i>.
However, Rauhut (2012) later recognized this is present in numerous
other theropods as well, including <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>, <i>Suchomimus</i>
and several basal coelurosaurs. Agnolin et al. (2010) misunderstood
Rauhut as claiming <i>Kakuru</i> had a median ridge in the ascending
process' facet, which they noted is a taphonomic artifact in that
taxon. Those authors placed <i>Kakuru</i> in Averostra incertae sedis,
though this can be narrowed further as they correctly point out no
ceratosaur has such a high ascending process. <i>Kakuru</i> is
retained as Tyrannoraptora incertae sedis here.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (SMNK 2349 PAL) (~2.1 m; subadult) posterior twelfth
dorsal vertebra, thirteenth dorsal vertebra (26 mm), twefth dorsal rib,
gastralia, anterior synsacrum, partial ilia, pubes, incomplete ischia,
incomplete femora (165 mm), proximal tibia, proximal fibula, intestine,
postpubic airsac(?)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Naish et al., 2004) pubic peduncle of
ilium with concave cranial surface; pubic boot with no cranial
expansion and 32% total length of pubis; pedicular fossae located
craniodorsal to neural canal on caudal dorsal vertebra; distal tips of
the neural spines between 63% and 67% longer than their bases; ventral
surface of sacral centra bearing shallow median depressions at either
end; extremely thin bone walls to all known elements.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was obtained from a private collector.
Brusatte (2013) determined that contra earlier authors, both the
obturator fenestrae of the pubes and ischia were originally closed,
with those of the left pubis and right ischium only appearing open due
to damage.<br>
This taxon was originally described as a compsognathid (Martill et al.,
2000; Naish et al., 2004) and found to be in that clade in Rauhut's
(2003) analysis (though unnamed at the time), based on
anteroposteriorly expanded dorsal neural spine apices and an elongate
pubic boot with reduced cranial component. However, these characters
are common among other basal coelurosaurs, including basal
tyrannosauroids. Novas et al. (2012) and Brusatte et al. (2014) also
recovered this result, but it can move to Tyrannosauroidea in the
latter with only 4 steps. Naish (online, 2006) noted <i>Mirischia</i>
is similar to tyrannosauroids in having an anteriorly concave pubic
peduncle and referred the taxon to that clade. Dal Sasso and Maganuco
(2011) found it to be the most basal coelurosaur in their version of
Senter's TWiG analysis. Hartman et al. (2019) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirischia</span> as closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>
and coelurids, though tyrannosauroid characters were not extensively
sampled.  Placing it in Compsognathidae required 6 more
steps.  <br>

<b>Early Albian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Eumeralla Formation of the Otway Group, Victoria, Australia</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (NMV P186303) femur (430 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon was only briefly described by Rich and
Vickers-Rich (1994), and their photos of the femora are not very useful
for determining morphology. It was referred to Ornithomimosauridae
[sic] within Ornithomimosauria, though without explicit supporting
evidence. The authors did list two characters to distinguish
ornithomimosaur femora from carnosaurs' though- anteroposteriorly
compressed head; anterior trochanter extends proximal to greater
trochanter. At least the latter is definitely present in <i>Timimus</i>,
and is only known in <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span>
plus tyrannosaurids, <i>Aniksosaurus</i> and maniraptorans. It is
absent in ornithomimosaurs, contra Rich and Vickers-Rich, making it
unlikely <i>Timimus</i> belongs to this clade. As for the compressed
femoral head, this is not significantly different from <i>Allosaurus</i>
or <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> in <i>Sinornithomimus</i> or <i>Gallimimus</i>,
while it is slightly anteroposteriorly compressed in <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
and proximodistally compressed in <i>Sinornithomimus</i>. Rich and
Vickers-Rich also list one character to distinguish
"ornithomimosaurids" from elmisaurids (presumably within
Ornithomimosauria, though elmisaurids are now known to be caenagnathid
oviraptorosaurs)- proximally placed anterior trochanter base. Yet the
distally placed base in the "elmisaurid" <i>Chirostenotes</i> is a
misinterpreted accessory trochanter. Thus there are no valid published
reasons for referring <i>Timimus</i> to Ornithomimosauria or
Ornithomimidae. The authors diagnose <i>Timimus</i> solely on the
basis of lacking an extensor groove, presumably compared to <i>Gallimimus</i>
which has an autapomorphic closed groove. Yet other ornithomimosaurs (<i>Garudimimus</i>,
<i>Sinornithomimus</i>, <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>) lack extensor
grooves, which is similar to most maniraptoriforms, and <i>Timimus</i>
actually has a groove. <br>
Salisbury et al. (2007) state that <i>Timimus</i> is paravian and
shares characters with unenlagiine deinonychosaurs, which was
elaborated on by Agnolin et al. (2010). <br>
Benson et al. (2012) noted Agnolin et al.'s supposedly
dromaeosaurid-like characters are absent- a fourth trochanter is
present, and the anterior and greater trochanters are separated by a
deep notch, and that it differs from maniraptorans in lacking an
anteroposteriorly thick greater trochanter. Instead, they believed it
to be a tyrannosauroid closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>, but not as
derived as <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiongguanlong</span> due
to the shallow extensor groove (and I note it is also more shallow than
in <i>Juratyrant)</i>. 
The tyrannosauroid identification  is based on characters
supposedly differing from ornithomimosaurs- elevated femoral head;
anteroposteriorly narrower anterior trochanter; "accessory trochanter
forms a transversely thickened region" instead of being "prominent,
triangular."  However, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
also has an elevated femoral head, with the angle in both taxa being
less than derived tyrannosauroids.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
has a similarly narrow
anterior trochanter relative to total femoral depth.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Timimus</span> actually has a more
prominent accessory trochanter than e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>, the trochanter
of e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span> is
rounded too, and those of e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus</span> do not differ
in transverse width.  Thus I don't think the data strongly favors
either option and leave <span style="font-style: italic;">Timimus</span>
as Tyrannoraptora incertae sedis.<br>
Britt (1993) mentions NMV 186303 as a dromaeosaurid dorsal vertebra.
This may be a typo for NMV 186302, an oviraptorosaur dorsal vertebra
described by Currie et al. (1996).  The smaller paratype femur NMV
P186323 was found to be quite different by Benson et al. and referred
to Maniraptora. Rich and Vickers-Rich also mention "a number of
vertebrae" from Victoria they refer to ornithomimosaurs, but do not
list in the hypodigm of <i>Timimus</i> (one may be caudal vertebra NMV
P186168 that Benson et al. refer to Ornithomimosauria). These would not
be likely to belong to <i>Timimus</i> now that the genus has been
shown to be more basal. Currie et al. (1996) mention the pubis NMV
P186058 and vertebrae from the type locality and the Strzelecki Group.
The pubis is probably a typo for NMV P186046 from the type locality,
which was described by Benson et al. (2010) as a basal tyrannosauroid,
so may actually belong to <i>Timimus</i> after all. The lack of
details for the vertebrae is similar to Rich and Vickers-Rich's
comment. Finally, Pigdon (online 1997) mentions a possible
ornithomimosaur ungual from the Strzelecki Group found in 1996. This
may be NMV P199085, a manual ungual described by Benson et al. (2012)
as being weakly curved with a low flexor tubercle and flattened ventral
surface which is broader than the dorsal surface. The authors referred
it to Theropoda indet., and there is no evidence it belonged to <i>Timimus</i>.<br>

Material</b>- (IGM coll.) (~1 m) humerus, radius, ulna, manus, femur,
tibia, metatarsus, pedal phalanges<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
This specimen was originally announced in a Japanese newspaper article
in 1994 (Endo, DML 1994), and was found by the Joint Japan-Mongolia
paleontological expedition in Khuren Dukh, which would mean it was
discovered between July 29 and August 9 1993 (Watabe and Suzuki, 2000)
and housed at the IGM. Holtz (DML, 1994) stated from his examination of
the article and news footage it appeared to be a coelurosaur with a
didactyl manus and a non-arctometatarsalian metatarsus (if it was in
anterior view, which is uncertain). Olshevsky (DML, 1995) reported that
Barsbold (pers. comm., November 1995) stated the taxon is a basal
tyrannosauroid with didactyl manus and non-arctometatarsalian pes,
confirming Holtz's interpretations. He also reported Barsbold said the
description was in press, though it has yet to appear more than two
decades later. Both Holtz and Olshevsky have suggested the specimen may
be a juvenile, due to its small size. Barsbold (pers. comm., 2001)
stated the manus is actually tridactyl, while the metatarsus is "almost
not pinched", perhaps indicating a subarctometatarsal morphology. 
While it may still be a tyrannosauroid, the lack of a didactyl manus
removes the only known reason for this assignment, though it should be
noted basal tyrannosauroids (e.g. <i>Dilong</i>, <i>Guanlong</i>)
have tridactyl manus and closely resemble compsognathid/coelurid grade
coelurosaurs morphologically, including in pedal anatomy.  A
subarctometatarsus would suggest a tyrannoraptoran assignment at
least.  Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019) have since published
the name as a nomen nudum.<br>

<b>Material</b>- partial femoral shaft, incomplete tibia, incomplete

<b>Comments</b>- Button et al. (2014) describe a coelurosaurian
hindlimb discovered in 2012 which is arctometatarsalian and gracile.
They state "Metatarsal IV most resembles <i>Coelurus</i> (YPM 2010)
from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation in general proportion,
mediolateral compression of the distal aspect, and near absence of a
lateral collateral ligament pit, yet is unique in possessing an
obliquely oriented groove marking the extensor surface and a dorsally
bulbous distal condyle." <i>Coelurus</i> is generally found to be
surrounded by nonarctometatarsalian taxa though, which could indicate
this Mussentuchit taxon shows some coelurids convergently evolved an
arctometatarsus, or that similarities to <i>Coelurus</i> are
homoplasious and the new taxon belongs to an arctometatarsalian clade.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Traditionally a
wastebasket family for small Jurassic and Cretaceous theropods, a
reduced version including <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>
has been recovered in most modern analyses.  While it is clearly
close to the origins of Tyrannoraptora, the most recent analyses are
ambiguous as to what branch of that clade it belongs to.  Senter
et al.'s (2012) and Brusatte et al.'s (2014) TWiG analyses recover it
as the basalmost family of tyrannosauroids, but it can be moved to
basal Maniraptoromorpha in both analyses using only two extra
steps.  Hartman et al. (2019) recover them as maniraptoromorphs
but do not deeply sample tyrannosauroid characters, though it only
takes 4 steps to move them to the latter clade.  Cau (2018)
uniquely finds the family divided, with <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span> the basalmost
tyrannosauroid and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
the basalmost maniraptoromorph.  Hartman et al.'s matrix does
reject the sometimes proposed placement in Maniraptora though (e.g.
Gauthier, 1986), which requires 13 more steps to enforce. Most
recently, Rauhut et al. (2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group
Theropod Matrix to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
as either sister to Maniraptoriformes, a basal ornithomimosaur or a
basal therizinosaur.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Choiniere et al., 2010) large, slit-like
quadrate foramen inclined medially at approximately 45 degrees with
associated deep fossa on the quadrate; sacral centrum 5 with an
obliquely oriented posterior articular surface that is angled
anterodorsally; fovea capitis very large, occupying almost the entire
posterodorsal surface of the femoral head; distal condyle of metatarsal
III large relative to that of other metatarsals and bearing an
anteromedially projecting flange on its anteromedial margin.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 2001 and announced in
an abstract by Clark et al. (2002) as a basal coelurosaur. It was later
described in more detail in an abstract by Choiniere et al. (2008), who
used a version of the TWG matrix and found it to be one of the most
basal coelurosaurs, sister to <i>Tugulusaurus</i>. Choiniere et al.
(2010) named and described the taxon in depth, although several months
earlier, the description and name appeared in Choiniere's (2010) thesis.<br>
Choiniere et al. (2010) recovered it either as a non-tyrannoraptoran
coelurosaur in a trichotomy with <i>Tugulusaurus</i>
or as a non-maniraptoriform maniraptoromorph.  Brusatte et al.
(2014)
found it to be sister to Tyrannoraptora (it appears in a polytomy in
their Figure 1 due to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>'
variable position), while Cau (2018) uniquely recovered it as the most
basal tetanurine.  While not shown due to non-maniraptoromorph
characters being poorly sampled, <span style="font-style: italic;">Zuolong</span>
falls out in Coeluridae in the analysis of Hartman et al. (2019). 
It
is tentatively placed there on this site, pending more extensive future
analyses.<br>

?(YPM 9163; not 1252, contra Welles and Long, 1974) astragalus (74 mm
wide) (Welles and Long, 1974)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Carpenter et al., 2005) very gracile
dentary; paired pleurocoels on some cervical centra; triangular
cervical transverse processes angled sharply ventrolaterally; pubic
foot very acuate ventrally, projected posterodorsally; interpubic
fenestra located at midlength of pubic symphysis; metatarsus subequal
to femur in length. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- YPM 1994, 1995, 2010 and possibly 9162 belong to the
syntype individual (Ostrom, 1980), as they are comparable in size
(contra Marsh, 1884), do not contain duplicated elements and are from
the same part of the same quarry. Thus, <i>Coelurus agilis</i> is an
objective junior synonym of <i>Coelurus fragilis</i>.<br>
YPM 9163 was described by Welles and Long, and matches the astragalus
of YPM 2010 except for its size. Carpenter et al. (2005) state they may
be different specimens, or Welles and Long could have misreported YMP
9163's size. However, Ostrom (1980) reports YPM 9163 is from Quarry 9,
which would prove it's a different specimen. Based on stratigraphy, it
may belong to the unnamed (?)enigmosaur of Makovicky (1997) instead.<br>
YPM 1933 is from Quarry 12, and its referral to <i>Coelurus fragilis</i>
by Marsh (1896) is unfounded. It may belong to <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Tanycolagreus</i>
or another small theropod. <br>
Makovicky (1995) and Carpenter et al. (2005) both list two complete
dorsal vertebrae, five centra and six arches. Yet Carpenter et al.
illustrate eleven total arches, which even considering one is attached
to the centrum and two are the indeterminate arches also listed, leaves
two extra illustrated arches. Similarly, Carpenter et al. illustrate a
total of six dorsal centra, which means one is unillustrated. In
addition, only four cervical vertebrae are listed among the <i>Coelurus</i>
specimens, yet five are illustrated because Carpenter et al. illustrate
dorsal 1 as a cervical. Ostrom (1980) mentions a second cervical
vertebrae in YPM 1993, which he believes was combined with the other
cervical to create a composite Marsh (1881) illustrated. Carpenter et
al. (2005) concluded Marsh combined a <i>Coelurus</i>
cervical with either YPM 1996 or 1997 (belonging to Makovicky's 1997
possible enigmosaur) to create the composite, but this conflicts with
Ostrom's statement. The vertebra illustrated by Marsh (1881) as a
dorsal is a proximal caudal (YPM 1991). Ostrom (1980) lists a
metacarpal III and metacarpal IV fragment as being present, but
Carpenter et al. illustrate a proximal metacarpal I, and a fragment of
a much thinner element. The latter resembles a distal phalanx III-3
most.  Carrano (1998) lists femoral and tibial measurements for
"YPM 1991?" as 220.0 and 255.0 respectively, near certainly meaning YPM
2010, but the tibia is missing its proximal end.<br>
Several vertebrae referred to <i>Coelurus fragilis</i> by Gilmore
(1920) were provisionally referred to the unnamed coelurosaur described
by Makovicky (1997) by Carpenter et al. (2005). A partial skeleton was
referred to <i>Coelurus</i> by Miles et al. (1998), also prompting
them to refer a manus (AMNH 587) previously referred to <i>Ornitholestes</i>
to <i>Coelurus</i>. However, the skeleton was later made the holotype
of <i>Tanycolagreus topwilsoni</i> by Carpenter et al. (2005) and the
manus was referred to that species instead. A pubis referred to <i>Coelurus</i>
by Gilmore (1920) was also referred to <i>Tanycolagreus</i> by
Carpenter et al. (2005).<br>
Gilmore (1920) doubted the accuracy of the three characters used by
Osborn (1903) to distinguish <i>Coelurus</i> from <i>Ornitholestes</i>,
which led to many synonymizing them until Ostrom (1980) properly
differentiated the genera. His preliminary analysis was confirmed once
both <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Ornitholestes</i> were redescribed in
detail by Carpenter et al. (2005).<br>

<b>Late Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic</b> <br>
<b>Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, Colorado, US</b><br>
<b>Referred</b>- ?(USNM 5737; intended holotype of <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>
"philtippettensis" and "philtippettorum") distal pubes (Gilmore, 1920)<br>
<b>Late Kimmeridgian, Late Jurassic</b><br>
<b>Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, Utah, US</b><br>
<b>Paratype</b>- (UUVP 2999) (~6.3 m) premaxilla (32 mm) (Madsen, 1974)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carpenter et al., 2005) short, deep-bodied
premaxilla that is pierced by narial foramen at the base of the nasal
process; orbital process on the postorbital; T-shaped quadratojugal;
centrodiapophyseal lamina on dorsals. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The first remains of this species were originally
referred to <i>Ornitholestes</i> (Osborn, 1916), <i>Coelurus</i>
(Gilmore, 1920) and <i>Stokesosaurus</i> (Madsen, 1974). The holotype
was collected in 1995 and initially thought to be <i>Coelurus</i>
(Miles et al.,1998). Its name was first published in a guide to the
North American Museum of Ancient Life, credited to Carpenter and Miles.
Assigned to Coeluridae without supporting synapomorphies by Carpenter
et al. (2005), it does indeed fall out as a coelurid in almost all
published analyses such as Brusatte et al. (2014).  The genus
could be synonymous with <i>Stokesosaurus clevelandi</i>, whose
holotype and referred ilia, and referred braincase cannot be compared
to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>.<br>
The distal pubes USNM 5737 were discovered in 1884 and provisionally
referred to <i>Coelurus agilis</i> by Gilmore in 1920 based on their
size. Pickering (1995a) listed the name <i>Elaphrosaurus
philtippettorum</i> in an unpublished bibliographic manuscript. In that
same year, Pickering printed a packet with a description of the taxon
as ?<i>Elaphrosaurus</i> <i>philtippettensis</i>, indicating USNM 5737
is the intended type. Both variants on the name are nomina nuda
however, as he didn't follow ICZN Article 8.1.3- it must have been
produced in an edition containing simultaneously obtainable copies by a
method that assures numerous identical and durable copies. Pickering
also referred USNM 8414 (two metatarsals) and 8415 (a humerus) without
justification. However, there are no characters in the diagnosis except
that it shares a straight humerus with <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and
abelisaurids (which does not involve the intended type), and the only
characters listed in the description are those which distinguish USNM
8415 from <i>Dryosaurus</i>. It is therefore also a nomen nudum in
that it lacks "a description or definition that states in words
characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon." Pickering
will also describe the species in his in progress work Mutanda
Dinosaurologica. Carpenter et al. (2005) referred USNM 5737 to their
new taxon <i>Tanycolagreus</i> because of its straight ventral edge
and dorsally placed interpubic fenestra, unlike <i>Coelurus</i>.
Additionally, <i>Ornitholestes</i> lacks an interpubic fenestra
altogether. Why Pickering referred USNM 5737 to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>
is unknown, as he does not discuss the specimen (except to note it is
"elongate, ... lacking a crest on its craniodorsal surface. In lateral
view, the distal foot is ventrally convex.") and <i>E. bambergi</i>
does not preserve the distal pubis. Furthermore, other ceratosaurs like
<i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Kryptops</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i> have a
very distally placed interpubic fenestra, so USNM 5737 is probably not
a ceratosaur. Carpenter et al.'s assignment is here retained, though it
should be noted <i>Juratyrant</i> also has a distally flat pubic boot
and proximally placed interpubic fenestra. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Ji et al. (2007) described this as a
compsognathid, and it does emerge as one in most TWiG analyses such as
Brusatte et al. (201) and Senter et al. (2012).  However, Cau
(2018) recovers it as the sister to Tyrannoraptora, while Hartman et
al. (2019) find it to be a maniraptoromorph just stemward of
compsognathids.  While it can move to Compsognathidae in the
latter matrix with only 4 more steps, most suggested character data was
utilized.  Interestingly, only one step moves it to be more
closely related to basal tyrannosauroids like <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilong</span> and proceratosaurids.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- "Huaxiasaurus" was first announced in 2000 in news
articles as a genus of bird. The specimen was later mentioned by Hwang
et al. (2001) in an abstract, and described briefly by Hwang et al.
(2004). It is poorly reconstructed and prepared, with many elements
placed in the wrong position. Hwang et al. (2004) tentatively referred
it to their new genus <i>Huaxiagnathus</i>, as the morphology is
identical with the holotype except for a shorter skull (34% of femoral
length instead of 45%). It may be an older individual.<br>
Hwang et al.'s (2004) phylogenetic analysis recovered <i>Huaxiagnathus</i>
as a basal compsognathid, which has also occured in future versions of
the TWiG analysis, such as Senter et al. (2012) and Brusatte et al.
(2014).  Hartman et al. (2019) finds it just stemward of
compsognathids, in a clade with <span style="font-style: italic;">Juravenator</span>,
but both can be placed in that family with only a single added step.<br>

cladogram where Maniraptoriformes should be.  The term never
gained popularity and went unused for over a decade.  Hendrickx
(2015) uses 'Neocoelurosauria' in apostrophes in cladograms in his
thesis for a clade of compsognathids plus maniraptoriforms, while Paul
(2016) uses it informally for "coelurosaurs more derived than
tyrannosauroids".  This makes Paul's version another term for
Cau's 2018 Maniraptoromorpha.  Alosnso et al. (2017) and Young et
al. (2019) both use neocoelurosaur informally, referring to Hendrickx's
thesis.  Hendrickx et al. (2019) officially proposed
Neocoelurosauria, defining it as "the clade Compsognathidae +
Maniraptoriformes", which can be more or less inclusive than
Maniraptoromorpha depending on the topology.  </font></font><br>

<p><b><a name="Beelemodon"></a>"Beelemodon"</b> Bakker, 1997 <br>
<b>Kimmeridgian-Tithonian, Late Jurassic <br>
Morrison Formation, Wyoming, US</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (TATE 546) (~1.5-4 m) tooth (7.1 mm long, FABL 5.4 mm)
<br>
(TATE coll.) tooth (~9 mm) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- Currently indeterminate pending more detailed
comparison to several theropod taxa. <br>
<b>Description</b>- This taxon is still a nomen nudum, as it is not yet
diagnosed, nor does it have a species name. Bakker describes it as an
"omnivorouscarnivorous dinosaur of uncertain relations" and an
"enigmatic dinosaur". It is supposedly "coyote-to-wolf size". Although
using tooth size to determine total length is extremely risky,
comparison to various theropods indicates a length of 1.5-4 meters is
probable, depending on body form. It is unclear whether postcranial
remains can be referred to the taxon, as only teeth are described and
illustrated. A single tooth is illustrated in side view and cross
section. Another tooth is plotted in the "denticle-width vs. crown
height" graph, indicating a slightly larger specimen is known as well. <br>
The illustrated tooth is slightly recurved, laterally compressed (50%
as wide as anteroposteriorly long) and missing its distal tip. Fluting
is present on the illustrated side. The root is constricted, the mesial
carina lacks serrations and the distal carina has serrations extending
to the base. The serrations are small (4.3 per mm, ~35 on the whole
crown), pointed and project slightly distally. The cross section
indicates it was fairly symmetrical labiolingually, narrowing
anteriorly and exhibiting a slight mesial expansion labially(?) and a
slight distal expansion lingually(?). <br>
<b>Comments</b>- At first glance, these specimens look very similar to
ornithischian premaxillary teeth. The posterior two premaxillary teeth
of <i>Lesothosaurus</i> have mesial serrations, but lack them distally
except at the tip. This is the reverse of the case in "Beelemodon". The
serrations are comparatively larger (~15 per tooth if they extended as
basally as in "Beelemodon") and do not extend to the base of the crown.
<i>Drinker</i> has a very similar tooth morphology, with serrations
present only on the distal carina. These serrations are slightly larger
(25-30 per tooth) and have longer interdenticle slits. The tooth itself
is not recurved, but is otherwise similar in shape. <i>Galtonia</i>
also has similarily shaped teeth, but with larger serrations and mesial
serrations present apically. "Beelemodon" is obviously based on
theropod maxillary or dentary teeth however, as the premaxillary teeth
of most theropods have serrations displaced so that the distance
between them is much longer labially than lingually. Troodontids,
tyrannosaurids and ornithischians have premaxillary teeth that not only
have the latter character, but are also much wider labiolingually than
"Beelemodon". The cross section of "Beelemodon" is very similar to
theropod maxillary and dentary teeth. <br>
While "Beelemodon" is theropod, placing it within that clade is a more
difficult task. Among Jurassic and Cretaceous taxa the constricted root
is known in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Proceratosaurus</span>, <i>Compsognathus</i>
and most maniraptorans except dromaeosaurids and unenlagiines. 
Unserrated mesial carinae and serrated distal carinae are present in
megaraptorans, <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>,
basal maniraptoromorphs, some troodontids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Caihong</span> and some
dromaeosaurids.  Thus it is most likely either compsognathid or
troodontid.  <i>Compsognathus</i> has some teeth that have
unserrated mesial carinae and serrated distal carinae. These have
larger serrations relative to crown height (20-25 per tooth). They are
shaped similarily and have similar serration morphology.  Given
the amount of variation in serration number in a single theropod genus (<i>Allosaurus</i>-
20-35; <i>Saurornitholestes</i>- 15-35), there is no way to separate
"Beelemodon" from <i>Compsognathus</i> at this point. Because of this,
it must remain indeterminate. The fluting or serration morphology may
eventually prove diagnostic, but this cannot be determined from the
available literature. I recommend classifying "Beelemodon" as a
provisionally indeterminate maniraptoromorph nomen nudum until further
research is done. <br>

Zhao, 1986<br>
= <i>Microvenator</i> "chagyaensis" Zhang and Li, 1997 <br>
<b>Early Cretaceous</b><br>
<b>Lura Formation, Tibet, China</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (IVPP coll.) specimen including teeth<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1976 (An et al., 2021), this specimen
was first reported by Zhao (1983) who while discussing the evolution of
dinosaurs in China noted "the teeth of coelurosaurids (<i>Microvenator</i>
Ostrom) gradually disappeared and became few in number" in the Early
Cretaceous. He earlier noted the "tooth is thinnest and no serration
occurs" in Early Cretaceous coelurosaurs. As Ostrom did not refer any
teeth to <i>Microvenator</i>, it might be concluded Zhao was referring
to the teeth of an undescribed Chinese specimen of <i>Microvenator</i>.
This idea is strengthened by the later mention of a new <i>Microvenator</i>
species from the same deposits as other Early Cretaceous taxa Zhao
mentions (<i>Monkonosaurus</i>, <i>?Asiatosaurus</i>, <i>?Prodeinodon</i>).
As with other new Tibetan taxa listed by Zhao (1983), it was probably
supposed to be described by Zhao in the published version of his
doctoral dissertation "The Mesozoic vertebrate remains of Xizang
(Tibet), China", in the second Palaeontology of Xizang volume. Yet this
volume is only referenced by Zhao (1983; which was submitted in
September 1981) and seems never to have been printed, though the
previous volume was published by the IVPP in 1980 and the third by the
NIGP in 1981. Olshevsky (DML, 1999) notes the IVPP rejected the paper
as unpublishable. Zhao (1986) reported <i>Microvenator chagyabi</i>
from the Loe-ein Formation. It was later mentioned by Zhang and Li
(1997) as <i>Microvenator chagyaensis</i> from the Laoran Formation of
Qamdun, Zhag'yab County, Tibet. It is near certainly the same specimen
listed as ?Coelurosauria indet. by Weishampel et al. (2004) from the
Lura Formation of Xizang Zizhiqu. As the specimen has never been
described or illustrated, it is a nomen nudum. If it indeed has
serrationless teeth, it is probably a coelurosaur at least as crownward
as compsognathids. It may even be a basal oviraptorosaur like <i>Microvenator
celer</i>, as the Early Cretaceous Chinese taxa <i>Incisivosaurus</i>,
<i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> and <i>Caudipteryx</i> have serrationless
teeth as well. However, there is still no published evidence for this
or its generic referral.<br>
Chure and McIntosh (1989) accidentally use the combination <i>Microvenator
dayensis</i>, presumably caused by confusion with the sauropod
"Microdontosaurus dayensis".<br>

Discovered in 1995 and originally mentioned as a nomen nudum in an
Argentinian newpaper article, with the discovery attributed to Martinez
et al.. In 1997, the taxon was briefly described (but still not named)
in an abstract by Martinez and Novas.

Its formal description was finally published in 2006.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Phylogenetic relationships</span>- In
its description, Martinez and Novas (2006) proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span>
was a coelurosaur outside Maniraptoriformes, the latter containing
tyrannosaurids in their phylogeny.  While not included in a
phylogenetic analysis, they did list three characters supporting this
placement.  "Distal tibia with astragalar surface proportionally
low" is also true in basal tyrannosauroids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>) and maniraptoromorphs (<span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>, alvarezsauroids
including <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>). 
"Insertion of the M. caudifemoralis longus extensive and deep"  is
plesiomorphic for maniraptoromorphs, also being found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Juravenator</span>
and all ornithomimosaurs.  Robust limb elements were stated to
resemble carnosaurs and megalosauroids more than most coelurosaurs,
specifically the humerus, ulna, femur, tibia and pes.  The humerus
is also robust in compsognathids and alvarezsaurids, while the
metatarsus is less robust than <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>,
therizinosaurs or <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>. 
However, any measure of basic robusticity such as femoral circumference
should also account for size correlation as larger taxa are typically
less gracile than smaller taxa.<br>
Although Dal Sasso and Maganuco (2011) show <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span> as sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span>
outside Tyrannoraptora in their Figure 113, this is based on a majority
consensus and the taxon can actually fall out as a tyrannosauroid or
maniraptoromorph instead.  Similarly, in Choiniere et al. (2010)
it is in a polytomy with tyrannosauroids, compsognathid-grade taxa,
ornithomimosaurs and maniraptorans.  Novas et al. (2012) recovered
it as the sister taxon to Maniraptoriformes.  Brusatte (2013:395)
stated "it is unclear if it possesses any clear coelurosaurian
characters" so did not include it in his TWiG analysis.  However,
as outlined above every analysis including <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span>
has recovered it within Coelurosauria, and only unquantified
appendicular robusticity has even been suggested to validly support a
more rootward placement than Tyrannoraptora.  Most recently,
Hartman et al. (2019)  recovered it in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Scipionyx</span>,
compsognathids and maniraptoriforms.  While there are some
alvarezsauroid-like characters (e.g. large presacral neural canals*,
ventrally keeled proximal caudal centra, transversely broad manual
ungual I*, laterally expanded brevis shelf*, distally projecting
lateral femoral condyle), enforcing this result in the Hartman et al.
matrix adds 9 steps.  However, the asterisked characters were not
included, so it could potentially only be 6 steps longer.<br>

dentary tooth<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1965, this specimen was originally
mentioned by Elzanowski (1983), then by Paul (1988) as a possible
aublysodontine tyrannosaurid. Elzanowski and Wellnhofer (1992, 1993)
originally suggested <i>Archaeornithoides</i> was most closely related
to spinosaurids, troodontids and <i>Lisboasaurus</i>, and that these
were all closer to birds than other known theropods. Spinosaurids are
now known to be basal tetanurines while <i>Lisboasaurus</i> is a
crocodiliform. However, in their 1993 article, they suggest <i>Archaeornithoides</i>
is more closely related to birds than <i>Lisboasaurus</i>, confusing
matters slightly. They rejected a troodontid relationship based on the
broad maxillary palatal shelf and unserrated teeth, but Currie (2000)
noted this is invalid as <i>Troodon</i> has the former, while Clark et
al. (2002) noted it's invalid because <i>Byronosaurus</i> has both
features. Indeed, both characters are now recognized as primitive for
troodontids, and maniraptoriforms in general. Currie further suggested
that <i>Archaeornithoides</i> may be a juvenile <i>Saurornithoides
mongoliensis</i>, while Averianov and Sues (2007) suggested it could be
a juvenile <i>Byronosaurus</i>. Besides the latter, there are other
Djadokhta troodontids with serrationless teeth- <i>Almas, Gobivenator</i>
and IGM 100/1128, but <i>Archaeornithoides</i> doesn't show a strong
resemblence to these or other paravians. Although Averianov and Sues
stated that Chiappe et al. (1996) proposed <i>Archaeornithoides</i>
was a juvenile dromaeosaurid, the latter authors actually only state
they believe the lack of serrations to be a juvenile character of
birdlike theropods, as they mistakenly assigned IGM 100/972 and 100/974
to Dromaeosauridae at the time. <i>Archaeornithoides</i> emerges in a
polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Scipionyx</span>,
compsognathids and maniraptoriforms in Hartman et al.'s (2019)
analysis, the only published one its been included in.  However,
only a single step moves it to Paraves where it emerges as a troodontid
near <span style="font-style: italic;">Mei</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiaotingia</span>, leaving its position
still highly uncertain.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Dal Sasso and Signore, 1998a)
accessory transverse postorbital ridge at fronto-parietal contact;
compressed scapholinare and semilunate carpal.<br>
(after Dal Sasso and Maganuco, 2011) five premaxillary teeth; ventral
squamosal process squared; only two carpals; distal carpals I and II
fused; manual digit III much longer (123%) than digit I;
preacetacetabular anterior concavity slightly developed and facing
anteriorly; obturator process quadrangular.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was first mentioned by Leonardi and
Teruzzi (1993) and described in depth in Signore's (1995) unpublished
thesis. It was preliminarily described and named by Dal Sasso and
Signore in 1998 and monographed by Dal Sasso and Maganuco (2011)<br>
The sternal plate identified by Dal Sasso and Signore (1998a) is
actually the left proximal humerus (Dal Sasso and Maganuco, 2011).<br>
Initially assigned to Maniraptoriformes by Dal Sasso and Signore
(1998a), Dal Sasso and Maganuco (2011) used a TwiG matrix to recover it
as a basal compsognathid.  Most recently, it emerges in a polytomy
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span>,
compsognathids and maniraptoriforms in Hartman et al.'s (2019) analysis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Both Aptilonia and Eoptilonia were named by Ji and Ji
(2001) in a cladogram, the former including <i>Compsognathus</i> and
the latter including <i>Sinosauropteryx</i>. Though not defined, their
etymology suggests reference to <i>Sinosauropteryx</i>'s preserved
primitive feathers and <i>Compsognathus</i>' lack of well preserved
feathers. The latter is probably preservational, neither state is
apomorphic, and both names are best seen as junior synonyms of
Compsognatha and Sinosauropterygiformes respectively.<br>
Paul (2016) creates the term haplocheirids for a group including only <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>, though he never uses
the technical term 'Haplocheiridae' that is
implied.  Nelson et al. (2012) used the taxon Haplocheiridae as a
misspelling of the amphipod genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheira</span>,
but as there is a tribe Haplocheirini based on that genus (Myers and
Lowry, 2003), the latter authors also implicitly created Haplocheiridae
due to ICZN Article 36.1  ("A name established for a taxon at any
rank in the family group is deemed to have been simultaneously
established for nominal taxa at all other ranks in the family
group").  Thus that word cannot be used for a family of theropods.
<br>
Placement of Compsognathidae relative to the base of Tyrannoraptora has
been contentious.  Most recently, Hartman et al. (2019) recovered
them as non-maniraptoriform maniraptoromorphs.  Eight more steps
are required to move them to Maniraptora as in Gauthier (1986), 13 more
to move them to Tyrannosauroidea as in Olshevsky (1991) and 15 more to
move them outside Tyrannoraptora as in Paul (1988).  <br>

<p><b><i><a name="Tugulusaurusfaciles"></a>Tugulusaurus</i></b> Dong,
1973 <br>
<i><b>T. faciles</b></i> Dong, 1973 <br>
<b>Early Cretaceous <br>
Lianmugin Formation of Tugulu Group, Xinjiang, China </b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP V4025) dorsal rib, four incomplete mid caudal
vertebrae (23, 25, 34 mm), metacarpal I (26 mm), manual phalanx I-1 (54
mm), manual ungual I (70 mm), femora (one proximal) (215 mm), tibia
(~240 mm), astragalus (32 mm wide), astragalar fragment, calcaneum,
distal metatarsal III, distal metatarsal IV, pedal phalanx IV-? (27
mm), pedal ungual III<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut and Xu, 2005) proximal mid-caudal
vertebrae with neural arch placed only on anterior two thirds of
centrum and centrum considerably broader than high (ratio width/height
ca. 1.5); caudal centra rapidly increasing in length distally; minimal
length of metacarpal I less than width of this bone; tibia with
pronounced, semicircular lateral expansion of lateral malleolus.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The tibia is referred to as a radius in the
translation of Dong 1973, which explains the rather odd statement that
the radius exceeds femoral length in Glut (1997). Although Dong states <i>Tugulusaurus</i>
differs from other ornithomimids in that the proximal third metatarsal
does not constrict, the proximal end is unpreserved.<br>
<b>Phylogenetic relationships</b>- Dong (1973) refers this genus to the
Coelurosauria based on hollow long bones and tibia longer than femur,
and to the Ornithomimidae based on the outline and characteristics of
the metatarsus and phalanges. <br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> was redescribed
by Rauhut and Xu (2005) and recovered as the first branching
coelurosaur in their analysis.  Instead, the Hartman et al. (2019)
places it in Compsognathidae.  Rauhut and Xu's position basal to <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span> and compsognathids (which
consisted of <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Aristosuchus</span> and the then-unnamed <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirischia</span>)
was based on three characters.  "Ascending process of astragalus:
arising out of lateral part of astragalar body" (127:0) is equivalent
to Hartman et al. character 209:0, which is quantified as "halfway up,
&lt;58% width of astragalocalcaneum."  This is also true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, scored unknown by Rauhut
and Xu.  Among compsognathids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
only expose their ascending process in section or obliquely so cannot
be measured precisely, but are not obviously broad as Rauhut and Xu
score the family.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>
was misscored 1 but has state 0.  Additionally, the compsognathids
<span style="font-style: italic;">Huaxiagnathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> have narrow processes, as
does the basal tyrannosauroid <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>
and the basalmost scorable therizinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Erliansaurus</span>. 
"Ascending process of astragalus: ... [less] than twice height of
astragalar body" (128:0/1) is similar to Hartman et al. character
208:1, although that compares process height to astragalocalcanear
width instead of astragalar body height.  While Rauhut and Xu
score <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> with an
uncertainty polymorphism regarding whether the process is lower or
higher than the body, their figures 4B and C combine to clearly show it
is higher so should be rescored 1.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
again has a low process
but was scored unknown.  Of their included compsognathids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span> does have state 2
but <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> has a
process higher than its body but by less than twice, so the family
should be scored 1+2.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>
was misscored 2 but has state 1.  Among taxa they did not include <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span> has state 1, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>
has state 0.  "Anterior side of distal tibia: with distinct
"step", running obliquely from medio-distal to latero-proximal" (122:0)
is not in the Hartman et al. character list.  Contra Rauhut and
Xu's scoring, it is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>. 
Among compsognathids (scored unknown by Rauhut and Xu), <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> appears to have a
high angled ridge on its right tibia and <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> possesses it as well.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span> has the ridge too, as
does <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinnareemimus</span>, so
ornithomimosaurs should be polymorphic.  Therizinosaurs were
scored unknown by Rauhut and Xu, but not only do <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Neimongosaurus</span> have a ridge, <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span> itself seems to as well
(photo of IGM 100/81 courtesy of Zanno).  Given its absence in <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothronychus</span>, therizinosaurs should
be rescored polymorphic. Basal maniraptoromorph <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span> exhibits a ridge but
was not included by Rauhut and Xu.  Basal tyrannosauroids not used
by Rauhut with a ridge include <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dilong</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span>. <br>
When the asterisked ten changes are made to Rauhut and Xu's matrix,
trees result where <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
can fall out in Compsognathidae.  <br>
Smith et al. (2007) also recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
outside tyrannosauroids plus maniraptoromorphs (including
compsognathids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>)
based on the same three characters (their 310, 320 and 321).  <br>
Rauhut et al. (2010) recovered the genus as the first branching
coelurosaur (before compsognathids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Shaochilong</span> and tyrannoraptorans)
based on the narrow ascending process (their 198).  <br>
Although not indicated by their published figure 18, Choiniere et al.
(2010) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
as sister to Tyrannoraptora.  Within Tyrannoraptora,
tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs and maniraptorans (including
compsognathids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
plus Pennaraptora) form a trichotomy.  This exclusion from
Tyrannoraptora is based on four characters.  Three of these are
the same as in Rauhut and Xu (437, 449, 450), and the fourth is a
result of misscoring numerous taxa- "Lateral accessory cnemial crest
... present" (427:1) was misscored among non-pennaraptoran coelurosaurs
as unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>
(absent), <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span> (present),
<span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> (present), '<span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus edmontonensis</span>' (= <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromiceiomimus</span>) (present) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span> (present), and misscored
as absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
(present) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
(present).  Thus a lateral crest is typical in basal
maniraptoromorphs.<br>
Novas et al. (2012) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
basal to <span style="font-style: italic;">Bicentenaria</span> and
Tyrannoraptora, based on Rauhut and Xu's three characters.<br>
Godefroit et al. (2013) used Cau's large theropod matrix to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> outside Tyrannoraptora
(including <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span> as tyrannosauroids, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinocalliopteryx</span>, compsognathids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Juravenator</span>
as maniraptoromorphs) based on two characters.  One is "Femur,
head and neck, proximodistal axis in proximal view: ... slightly
anteromedially directed (describes an angle of 40°-20° with the
mediolateral axis of the distal condyles)" (431:1), which is present in
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> whereas most
tyrannoraptorans have state 2, a strictly medially projected
head.  These states are generally not determinable from figures or
slab specimens, and were not recognized as distinct by workers before
the mid-2000's so that prior to that both were considered simply
medially directed (e.g. Rauhut's 2003 character 195).  Further,
Godefroit et al.'s given angle ranges aren't typical, as Benson
(2009:11) describes state 1 as "around 20 degrees", compared to state
0's "around 40-45 degrees."  Indeed <span style="font-style: italic;">Zuolong</span>,
scored state 1 by
Godefroit et al., has an angle of ~15 degrees.  Given these
caveats, Godefroit's scoring of 2 for <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span>
is incorrect as "the head appears to be angled slightly anteromedially
... but deformation of the specimen precludes confirmation of the true
angle" (Choiniere, 2010:176-177), and no other basal tyrannosauroid
condition has been reported until taxa as close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>
(Brusatte et al., 2011:26- "the head projects medially and not at all
anteriorly").  Among maniraptoromorphs most basal taxa preserving
proximal femora are slab specimens, and note <span style="font-style: italic;">Mirischia</span>'s
condition has not been reported in a modern context, where earlier
reports of a medially directed head (e.g. Rauhut, 2003:112) indicate
only state 1/2.  However, basal therizinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>
has "a slight cranial deflection from the transverse plane relative to
the distal condyles" (Zanno, 2010:217; misscored by Godefroit et al.),
basal ornithomimosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>'
head is "twisted 15 degrees anteromedially to the femoral shaft" (Lee
et al., 2014:259) and basal maniraptoromorph <span style="font-style: italic;">Aniksosaurus</span>
has a "craniomedially projected" head (Martinez and Novas,
2006:250).  Thus, like astragalar morphology, a strictly medial
femoral head angle may have evolved convergently in several
tyrannoraptoran clades.  The other character supporting this is
"Tibia, fibular condyle, posteriormost extent in proximal view: ... at
the same level of ... the posterior margin of the medial condyle"
(449:1), whereas most tyrannoraptorans are scored as having a fibular
condyle whose posterior margin is anteriorly offset.  While not
quantified by Godefroit et al., if we limit state 1 to those taxa with
medial condyles extending 11% or less posteriorly past the lateral
condyle (using the distance from the cnemial crest tip to the
intercondylar groove as 100%; <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>'
measures 7%), <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
(6%), <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> (11%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>
(10%) were misscored by Godefroit et al..  Indeed,
ornithomimosaurs and therizinosaurs exhibit the primitive condition
except for <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>.  Other basal
maniraptoromorphs without posteriorly restricted lateral condyles are <span style="font-style: italic;">Scipionyx</span> (lateral condyle extends
posterior to medial), <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinnareemimus</span>
(4%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span> (4%),
none of which Godefroit et al. included.  <br>
In more recent analyses, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
can fall out more crownward.  Choiniere et al. (2013) resolved <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
as a coelurid maniraptoran when ontogeny was accounted for. 
Brusatte et al. (2014) recovered it in a trichotomy with
tyrannosauroids and maniraptoromorphs.  Xu et al. (2018) resolved <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> as an alvarezsaur
sister to their new taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiyunykus</span>,
closer to alvarezsaurids than <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>
or their uniquely alvarezsaurian <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>. 
This position in Alvarezsauroidea was based on four characters not
included by Hartman et al. ("strong medial tab on metacarpal [I]";
"dorsolaterally and dorsomedially facing lateral and medial surfaces of
phalanx [I]-1 that are shallowly concave"; "axial furrow along the
flexor surface of phalanx [I]-1"; "partially enclosed ‘flexor notches’
on the medial and lateral surfaces of the proximal end of the ventral
surface of manual ungual [I]-2"), where it takes 5 more steps to force
as an alvarezsauroid.  Thus the true difference between a
compsognathid and alvarezsauroid placement could be as low as a single

illustrated is not mentioned in the text but is in the measurements
table.<br>
Qin et al. announced this in an abstract (2018) and later described it

fossil bird in China (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>

English title.  Chen et al.'s is closer, as Google Translate

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Kellner, 1999) foramen at medial base
of anterior trochanter; well developed sulcus on posterior femoral
head; fibular trochlea of triangular shape and constricted at base.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This theropod was known first announced by Kellner in
1996 and emphasis was placed on the soft tissue preserved with the
specimen. At that time, it was identified as a probable maniraptoran.
It was later preliminarily described and named in 1999, though a more
detailed description is planned.<br>
Initially described briefly as a maniraptoriform (Kellner, 1999) based
on Sereno's (1999) character "obturator notch U-shaped with slightly
divergent sides" (which I find highly variable), this has been
recovered in an uncertain position within Tyrannoraptora in the two
TWiG analyses which added it.  Dal Sasso and Maganuco (2011) found
it emerged as a tyrannoraptoran excluded from Coeluridae plus other
tyrannosauroids, Ornithomimosauria and Therizinosauria plus Metornithes
(note its maniraptoran position in their Fig. 113 is based on a
majority rules tree), while Novas et al. (2012) recovered it as a
tyrannoraptoran excluded from Tyrannosauridae, Ornithomimosauria and
Therizinosauria plus Pennaraptora.  Most recently, Hartman et al.
(2019) recover it as a compsognathid, but <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span> has usually been
posited to be a tyrannosauroid in current literature.<br>
Holtz (2004) questionably referred it to Tyrannosauroidea, though
without supporting evidence. Similarly, Agnolin et al. (2004) refer it
to Noasauridae without reason, though this seems less plausible. <br>
Novas et al. (2013) and derivatives recovered it as a tyrannosauroid
sister to Megaraptora plus Tyrannosauridae based on six
characters.  "Caudal vertebrae, ventral surface: flat" (their
113:0) must refer to distal caudals, as three of these are the only
preserved vertebrae in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>. 
While not verified by text or illustration in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>, of the taxa Hartman
et al. recover in Compsognathidae, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>
also lacks a median groove in the middle of its four preserved
caudals.  This is similar to tyrannosauroids as close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> as <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span>
but most compsognathids are not scorable due to lateral exposure of the
caudals.  "Ischium, ischial tubercle ventral to iliac peduncle:
... present as a convex bulge on the posterior surface of the ischium"
(their 167:1) is equivalent to Hartman et al.'s 180:1.  Although <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span> was not interpreted
by Novas et al. as having a proximodorsal process, it does show a
convexity comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>. 
"Ischium distal expansion: absent" (their 169:0) is equivalent to
Hartman et al.'s 189:1, but contrary to Novas et al., Hartman et al.
interpret the distal ischium as expanded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span> (~1.44 times minimum
shaft depth).  This doesn't matter in respect to Novas et al.'s
topology though, as <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span>
was also misscored and has a distal expansion and megaraptorans are now
known to exhibit this state too (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Murusraptor</span>). 
Thus an unexpanded ischium is convergent in tyrannosaurids and
pennaraptorans.  "Femur, fossa on the medial surface of the head,
lateral to the trochanteric fossa, form: ... deep" (their 175:1) was
"modified from Brusatte et al., 2010a: 286", but as Brusatte and Carr
(2016:S33) note, the fossa is on the posterior surface and IS the
trochanteric fossa.  It cannot be verified in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span> from available images
and description.  Contrary to Novas et al.'s scoring it seems to
be present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>-
"the femoral head ... is separated from the low, ridge-like greater
trochanter by a shallow depression" (Currie and Chen, 2001:1718),
notable when the holotype's femur is exposed in posterior view. 
They similarly misscored <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
as state 0 when the only specimen preserving a proximal femur has it
exposed in lateral view and crushed, so cannot be coded.  It's
also developed in the unincluded <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinocalliopteryx</span>,
but is generally difficult to discern in photos unless bound distally
by a ridge as in most tyrannosaurines.  "Tibia, form of medial
malleolus: ... oriented almost medially, 'shoulder' absent" (their
187:2) and "Tibia, medial expansion of distal medial malleolus: ...
expanded 40% or more than tibial mid-shaft width" (their 190:1). 
These are not determinable in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>
as the distal tibia is shattered with the only preserved surface facing

Delcourt and Nelson Grillo (2018) recently analyzed <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>
in the matrices of Choiniere et al. (2012), Carr et al. (2017) and
Porfiri et al. (2018), recovering it as a tyrannosauroid in each based
on several characters.  "A deep fossa on the medial surface of the
femoral head, lateral to the trochanteric fossa (175:1 in Porfiri et
al., 2018 and 362:1 in Carr et al., 2017)" was discussed above. 
"An ischial medial apron positioned along the anterior margin of its
shaft in medial view (357:1 in Carr et al., 2017)" as scored for
tyrannosaurines is not present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>,
which has the posterior shaft most projected medially.  "The
proximal margin of the femur is concave in posterior view due to a
greater trochanter that is elevated substantially relative to the
lateral portion of the proximal surface of the head (361:1 in Carr et
al., 2017)" is equivalent to Hartman et al.'s 490:1 and is not present
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>, which has a
slightly convex proximal margin and unelevated greater
trochanter.  "The lesser trochanter and the greater trochanter
extending to approximately the same level proximally (360:1 in Carr et
al., 2017)" is similar to Hartman et al.'s 319:2 and is not present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>. 
"A shallow femoral extensor groove on the anterior surface of the
distal end that is expressed as a broad concave anterior margin in
distal view but present as an extensive depression on the anterior
surface of the femur (366:1 in Carr et al., 2017)" is equivalent to
Hartman et al.'s 655:1 and would be similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span> and more derived
tyrannosauroids if verified in <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>. 
"The absence of an accessory ridge on the lateral surface of the
cnemial crest (510:0 in Choiniere et al., 2012)" was discussed above
(see <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> entry) and
its distribution in Choiniere's matrices is based on misscoring several
taxa.  In actuality only <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>
has state 0 among tyrannosauroids, with additional tyrannosauroids
exhibiting a ridge not mentioned in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span> discussion including- <span style="font-style: italic;">Yutyrannus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span>  and <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span>.  Thus, if <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>
does have state 0, it would not support a tyrannosauroid
identification.  "The absence of a horizontal groove across the
astragalar condyles anteriorly (539:0 in Choiniere et al., 2012)" is
700:0 in Hartman et al.'s analysis.  While true of tyrannosauroids
at least as close to Tyrannosauridae as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>, it is also seen in
almost every maniraptoromorph including <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>.<br>
Uncertainty in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Santanaraptor</span>
is due partly to its brief initial description, as a lack of a median
ventral groove in distal caudals and deep femoral extensor groove may
be tyrannosauroid-like, but have not been verified by text or
illustration.  Other suggested characters are based on misscorings
or also present in maniraptoromorphs.  As it only requires 5 steps
to place in Tyrannosauroidea in the Hartman et al. matrix, it is
tentatively assigned to Compsognathidae here pending better description
or photos.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Choiniere et al., 2010) metacarpal III
one-half the length of metacarpal II.<br>
(after Choiniere et al., 2014) dorsally expanded distal end of
posterior maxillary process; ventral edge of distal paroccipital
process twisted posteriorly.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Choiniere et al. (2010) suggested a
supposed second external mandibular fenestra was diagnostic, but
Choiniere (2010) later showed this was caused by breakage and
disarticulation. Choiniere et al. also suggested distally serrated
lateral teeth were diagnostic among alvarezsaurs, but these are
probably plesiomorphic, certainly if it is a compsognathid. 
Similarly, "alveolar margin of anterior end of dentary is dorsally
convex" was listed by Choiniere et al. (2010) but is is found in other
compsognathids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>). They also list
"heterodont dentary tooth row with enlarged dentary tooth 4", but the
first few dentary teeth being larger than others is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>.  <br>
<b>Comments</b>- While generally recovered as a basal
alvarezsauroid, Hartman et al. (2019) found it to be a compsognathid
instead, a placement originally proposed non-quantitatively by Alifanov
and Saveliev (2011:184).  Similarly, Choiniere et al. (2011) found
the braincase anatomy of parvicursorines was more similar to avialans
than to <i>Haplocheirus</i>, suggesting homoplasy or alvarezsauroid
polyphyly.  Among published phylogenetic analyses, Lee and Worthy
(2011) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>as
the basalmost ornithomimosaur in their Bayesian reanalysis of a TWiG
matrix, not separated from compsognathids by a majority bootstrap
value.  Enforcing a placement in Alvarezsauroidea requires 9 more
steps, but eight characters used by Choiniere et al. (2010) to place it
in the clade were not included.  This suggests neither a
compsognathid nor an alvarezsauroid identification is well supported
and more study is needed.  Agnolin et al. (2022) have since
contested Choiniere et al.'s characters, and concluded "there are some
features reminiscent to ornithomimosaurs and different from those of
alvarezsaurs."<br>

Smyth et al. (2020 online) identify two subparallel structures as broad
monofilamentous feathers equivalent to the 'elongated broad filamentous
feathers (EBFFs)' Xu et al. 2009 reported in <span style="font-style: italic;">Beipiaosaurus</span>. 
Yet the latter are ~5% of the length of the axial centrum compared to
~35% in "Ubirajara" and lack the midline ridge found in the latter
taxon's structures.  Instead, they resemble the rachis-dominated
retrices of basal pygostylians in length (~150 mm), having a rachidial
ridge and being paired.  While probably not associated with the
tail of "Ubirajara", these could belong to a fortuitously placed basal
pygostylian whose body (if it remained) would be placed in the large
mass of pseudomorphosed adipocere at the center of the specimen. 
Or the retrices may have been left behind (in the adipocere?) as
happened many times in Myanmar amber where pairs are preserved (Xing et
al., 2018).  Basal pygostylians were common in the Aptian and
present in the Nova Olinda Member, where the juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Cratoavis</span>
holotype has paired retrices 80 mm long.  Or they may be
separately evolved in "Ubirajara" after all despite the absence of
other examples outside Paraves.<br>
Smyth et al. use Brusatte's TWiG matrix to recover "Ubirajara" as a
compsognathid sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>. 
Entering it into Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix results in a
a sister group relationship with <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>
that shares absent cervical pleurocoels and a flexor fossa on manual
phalanx I-1, with both genera being compsognathids.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Xing et al.,
2020) vertical neural spine of each proximal caudal vertebrae
dorsoventrally taller than (or as tall as) associated anteroposterior
centrum length [only valid for c1-5]; pedal digit III (excluding
ungual) subequal in length to metatarsal III [93%].<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Xing et al.
(2020) listed sacral and proximal caudal centra dorsoventrally taller
than (or as tall as) anteroposteriorly long as being diagnostic, but
the sacral vertebrae are too poorly preserved to determine centrum
height while the caudal centra are all longer than tall (e.g. c3 15%
longer than tall).  They also listed preacetabular process as long
as
postacetabular process, but this is not evident from the specimen where
the pubic peduncle and anterior and ventral extent of the preacetabular
process is unpreserved.  Similarly, when they list "dorsal outline
straight and anterior margin round in lateral view" as a diagnostic
character of the ilium, the dorsal margin is convex and the anterior
and ventral edges of the preacetabular process are unpreserved so that
its shape is unknown.  A further supposed character "tibia
markedly
longer than predicted by an allometric trend among theropods
(tibia/femur length ratio is 1.53)", is seemingly due to incorrectly
estimating the femoral length, as the proximal end of the left femur
extends under the ilium and probably the sacrum as well.  The
ossification of distal tarsal II is another listed diagnostic feature,
but all saurischians lack this and given the preservation it is
probably the medial portion of distal tarsal III in both feet. 
Xing et
al. also list pedal phalanx IV-4 markedly longer than IV-3 as being
diagnostic, but neither illustration of either pes shows this, which
also seems to be the case for the photos.  Adjusted measurements
for
IV-3 and IV-4 (excluding proximal lips) of the left pes are given above
based on the photo, whereas the authors list 2.96 and 3.88 mm
respectively.  The right pes is in dorsal view so cannot be
measured as
precisely (Xing et al.'s measurements are 2.89 and 3.62 mm).  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The specimen was
discovered in 2013, and described and named by Xing et al.
(2019).  Unfortunately this was in a journal pre-proof posted
October 25 2019, but was electronic
and had no mention of ZooBank, so was a nomen nudum (ICZN Article
8.5.3. states names published electronically must "be registered in the
Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article
78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself that such registration
has occurred") until officially published in March 2020.  <br>
As Xing et al. (2020) noted, "YLSNHM-00005 was used by a private
collector as a component to assemble a chimaeric small theropod. The
slabs of the chimaera represent at least three different  animals,
but
were disassembled at YLSNHM under the supervision of the
authors." 
"The right femur of unknown origin was fitted in the original position
of the pubes by the collector. This retrofitted femur is nearly
identical in size to the left femur of YLSNHM-00005, and may belong to
the same animal. However, the planes of breakage did not match
perfectly between the retrofitted femur and the proximal portion of the
right femur that is preserved on the main slab. To be conservative,
this femur is treated separately from the holotype until there is
compelling evidence for its identity."  <br>
Although the authors identify their first illustrated largely preserved
vertebra as the first sacral, no actual structure is visiable in this
area, including the anterior and posterior rims, neurocentral suture
and fossa or rib articulation in their line drawing.  Based on
comparison with <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
MNHN CNJ 79, a sacral series of five would actually begin with the
following vertebrae, which is the measurement and interpretation used
here.  Its possible that one or more dorsals were incorporated
however given the uncertain anterior extent of the preacetabular
process.   In general, Xing et al. describe and score much more
information than
the poor preservation allows, which in addition to features noted above
include the tall sacral neural spines
(seemingly low and backswept in the last two sacrals), damage to the
sides of the sacrals and proximal caudals being viewed as "sacral ribs
[that] appear not to have been fully ossified", any absence of
accessory caudal neural spines, and brevis fossa development.  <br>
Xing et al. added <span style="font-style: italic;">Xunmenglong</span>
to Choiniere's coelurosaur analysis and
found it to be in Compsognathidae in both the primary dataset and one
where young taxa were scored conservatively for ontogenetic
characters.  When added to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph
analysis, it emerges as a compsognathid closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Peyer, 2006) ventral process at the posterior

I less than one third as long as metacarpal II; no fourth trochanter on
femur; hallux ends at or below the distal end of phalanx 1 of digit II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The genus and its type species were first named and
briefly described by Wagner in 1859, then more extensively described by
him in 1861, the date usually given for these taxa.<br>
While MNHN CNJ 79 was originally described as a new species, <i>C.
corallestris</i>, until Ostrom (1978) synonymized it with <i>C.
longipes</i>. Recently, Rauhut and Foth (2014) state newly discovered
casts of the holotype indicate it was more complete when found and
indicates "it is not the same taxon as the French <i>Compsognathus</i>."
<br>
Dames (1884) described three metapodials and a proximal phalanx (HMN
coll.) from the Solnhofen Formation, which was questionably referred to
<i>Compsognathus</i> by Huene (1925). However, Ostrom (1978) showed
that the shortest metapodial is too short to be a <i>Compsognathus</i>
metatarsal II (which is the shortest of its main three metatarsals) and
that the phalanx associated with it is too long to be II-1. These may
not be theropod, and may not even be metatarsals.<br>
Gauthier and Gishlick (2000) reinterpreted the manus of <i>Compsognathus</i>.
"Metacarpal I" is really phalanx I-1. The mystery element above the
skull is a very short metacarpal I. There is a collateral ligament pit
on metacarpal III, but no preserved phalanges. Thus, there may have
been a third digit or not.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Choiniere et al., 2013) large maxillary
fenestra occupying most of antorbital fossa; maxillary teeth with very
small, apically directed serrations restricted to distal carinae;
weakly opisthocoelous cervical centra; heterogeneous manual ungual
morphology with large, recurved ungual I and smaller unguals II and III
that have straight ventral surfaces; tibia with mediolaterally narrow,
proximodistally tall articular groove accepting the astragalar
ascending process that is only developed on anterolateral margin;
ascending process of astragalus low and restricted to lateral side of
tibia.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2006 and initially
described by Choiniere (2010) in his thesis as "Farragochela", then
published online on May 3 2013 with a different name. As the authors
included a Zoobank registration number, the name was valid under new
ICZN rules despite the physical version being unpublished until 2014. <br>
Choiniere et al. recover <i>Aorun</i> as the most basal
maniraptoromorph without ontogenetic consideration, and as a coelurid
in basal Maniraptora if ontogeny is taken into account, using a version
of Choiniere's matrix.  Xu et al. (2018) recently proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>
is the basalmost alvarezsauroid based on four unambiguous
synapomorphies- dorsoventrally flattened internarial bar; collateral
ligament fossae on metacarpal I absent; manual digit I bearing large
ungual and all other unguals distinctly smaller; proximodistally
oriented step-like ridge on anterior surface of tibia that braces
astragalar ascending process.  Most recently, Hartman et al.
(2019) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> as a
compsognathid, and found it takes 17 more steps to move to
Alvarezsauroidea.  This is similar to Cau's (2018) results, where <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>
are both non-tyrannoraptoran coelurosaurs and can form a
Compsognathidae with no extra steps, but it takes 9 extra steps to
force an alvarezsauroid <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>. 
Notably, even Xu et al.'s matrix only needs 4 steps to move <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>
to Compsognathidae.  Of Xu et al.'s proposed alvarezsauroid
characters, the flattened internarial bar was used by Hartman et al.
and is shared with the controversially compsognathid <span style="font-style: italic;">Haplocheirus</span>.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>
actually seems to have a weak medial ligament pit on metacarpal I
(Choiniere et al., 2013: Fig. 15A).  The ratio between manual
ungual I and II lengths (1.28) in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>
is not more than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>
(~1.29) or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>
(~1.79).  Finally, the ridge bracing the astragalar ascending
process is primitive for maniraptoriforms and also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tugulusaurus</span>.  Thus a
compsognathid identity is the best supported given proposed characters.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- In 2011 a complete juvenile theropod skeleton was
announced at the Munich Show Mineralientage München. Rauhut and Foth
(2011) had given a presentation on this specimen the previous month,
and the next year Rauhut et al. (2012) described it as <i>Sciurumimus
albersdoerferi</i>. Rauhut et al. scored it for three analyses- Smith
et al.'s (2008) found it as an orionidan more closely related to <i>Monolophosaurus</i>
and Avetheropoda; Choiniere et al.'s (2010) found it as an orionidan in
a polytomy with <i>Afrovenator</i>, spinosauroids and <i>Monolophosaurus</i>+Avetheropoda;
Benson et al. (2010) found it as a basal megalosaurid. This is
interesting as the specimen is extremely similar to the supposed basal
coelurosaur <i>Juravenator</i>, though both are juveniles. When <i>Juravenator</i>
is added to the former two matrices with <i>Sciurumimus</i> (it was
not added to Benson et al.'s inexplicably), it ends up sister to <i>Sciurumimus</i>
in the same positions described above outside Coelurosauria. Yet when <i>Juravenator</i>
is added and <i>Sciurumimus</i> is not, <i>Juravenator</i> is a
coelurosaur as usual. Cau (online, 2012) included <i>Sciurumimus</i>
in his much larger analysis and found it to be a non-tyrannoraptoran
coelurosaur by <i>Tugulusaurus</i> and <i>Zuolong</i>, with <i>Juravenator</i>
a maniraptoromorph.  This was eventually published in Godefroit et
al. (2013).  Hartman et al. (2019) examined the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>
issue in depth and found numerous inaccurate scorings in Smith et
al.'s, Choiniere et al.'s and Benson et al.'s matrices were to blame,
along with a few misscorings of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>. 
When these are corrected in each matrix, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Juravenator</span> can be
compsognathids.  This coincides with Hartman et al.'s recovery of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span> in Compsognathidae,
requiring 7 steps to move to Megalosauroidea.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>
does however possess several characters which are similar to some basal
tetanurines and are thus autapomorphies if it is a compsognathid- axial
pleurocoels absent, no posteroventral coracoid process, cuppedicus
fossa absent, obturator process not proximally defined.  Hartman
et al. included all but the second character in their analysis.<br>

This was described as a new specimen of <i>Sinosauropteryx prima</i>
by Ji and Ji (1997) and photographed on pages 78-79 of Ackerman (1998).
Longrich (DML, 2000) noted it differed from <i>Sinosauropteryx</i> in
several characters. He published an abstract in 2002 detailing his
reasoning, proposing NGMC 2124 was a compsognathid/coelurid-grade
coelurosaur, while <i>Sinosauropteryx</i> was a very basal coelurosaur
or even a basal carnosaur. Gishlick and Gauthier (2007) refer to the
specimen as <i>Sinosauropteryx? sp</i>. and figure the manus. Ji et
al. (2007) also agree it does not belong in <i>Sinosauropteryx</i>. 
Hartman et al. (2019) were the first authors to include NGMC 2124 in a
phylogenetic analysis and found it resolves as a compsognathid closest
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span> then <span style="font-style: italic;">Sciurumimus</span>, widely separated from <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span>.  Only three
steps are needed to make NGMC 2124 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx</span> sister taxa,
however, suggesting this is still quite possible.<br>
Hurum et al. (2006) determined "in the abdomen of a specimen (CAGS GMV
2124) of the feathered dinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosauropteryx
prima</span>,
three lower jaws of mammals have been preserved, rather than two as
previously mentioned by Ackerman (1998). Two of them belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Zhangheotherium</span>, the third to the
multituberculate <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinobaatar</span>..."<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut, 2000) teeth of premaxilla prominent,
larger than maxillary teeth and bearing flattened apex; retroarticular
process offset medially from lateral edge of mandible.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1900, the holotype skeleton was
originally described by Osborn (1903), who also referred a manus (AMNH
587) to the species. A partial skeleton was referred to <i>Coelurus</i>
by Miles et al. (1998), also prompting them to refer AMNH 587 to that
genus. However, the skeleton was later made the holotype of <i>Tanycolagreus
topwilsoni</i> by Carpenter et al. (2005) and the manus was referred to
that species instead. <i>Ornitholestes</i> has been questionably
identified at Quarry 9 in Wyoming (Carrano and Velez-Juarbe, 2006) and
Dry Mesa Quarry in Colorado (Britt, 1991), based on small elements that
could belong to <i>Coelurus</i>, <i>Tanycolagreus</i> or other
Morrison coelurosaurs as well.<br>

Gilmore (1920) doubted the accuracy of the three characters used by
Osborn (1903) to distinguish <i>Coelurus</i> from <i>Ornitholestes</i>,
which led to many synonymizing them until Ostrom (1980) properly
differentiated the genera. His preliminary analysis was confirmed once
both <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Ornitholestes</i> were redescribed in
detail by Carpenter et al. (2005).<br>

Makovicky (1995) described the vertebrae in detail, while Senter (2006)
described the manus. Carpenter et al. (2005) described the postcranial
skeleton, but the skull will be described by Norell in the future.
Brusatte (2013) elaborates that an osteological monograph is being
worked on by himself, Norell and Choiniere.  Chapelle et al.
(2021)
presented some of this at SVP 2021, showing new morphologies exposed by
CT scanning the skull.  Carpenter et al. incorrectly state only
one
humerus is known, do not mention the ulnar or left radial fragments,
incorrectly list metacarpal II or III as being preserved, as well as
fragments of two other metacarpals, and only mention one of the two
manual unguals. The tibia is seemingly unpreserved, contra Paul's
(1988) statement it is unusually short. In addition, a tarsal element
is listed in the materials list, but not mentioned in the description,
while two more pedal phalanges and two more pedal unguals are
illustrated than are listed as being preserved.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Phylogenetic relationships</span>-
This resolves as the basalmost maniraptoromorph in Hartman et al.
(2019), and is also a basal maniraptoromorph in Brusatte et al. (2014)
and Cau (2018). In Hartman et al.'s matrix, it requires 7 steps to move
outside Tyrannoraptora, 10 steps to be tyrannosauroid, and 13 steps to
be a maniraptoran.  More recently, Chapelle et al. (2021) proposed
a
novel hypothesis using a TWiG analysis that <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> is a basal
oviraptorosaur, with scansoriopterygids and oviraptorosaurs sensu
stricto more closely related to each other.  Updating its cranial
information and other relevant taxa in Hartman et al.'s matrix leads to
a revised position just outside Maniraptoriformes, but enforcing
membership in Oviraptorosauria takes eighteen additional steps, which
is more than the number of oviraptorosaurian characters indicated in
the presentation.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Azuma et al., 2016) large oval lacrimal
pneumatic recess; elongate tubercle on posterior surface of basal
tuber; highly heterodont dentition featuring robust unserrated teeth
including small spatulate anterior teeth, large and posteriorly curved
middle teeth, and small and nearly symmetrical posterior teeth;
cervical vertebrae with complex lamina system surrounding neural canal
resulting in deep and wide grooves for interspinous ligaments and
additional deep sockets; anterior cervical vertebrae with
interprezygapophyseal, postzygadiapophyseal, prezygadiapophyseal, and
interpostzygapophyseal laminae connecting to each other to form
extensive platform; eighth and ninth cervical vertebrae with
transversely bifid neural spines; dorsal, sacral and proximal caudal
vertebrae with strongly laterally curved hyposphene and
centropostzygapophyseal laminae that, together with postzygapophyseal
facet, form socket-like structure for receiving the prezygapophyses;
caudal zygapophyseal facets expanded to be substantially wider than
zygapophyseal processes; mid caudal vertebrae with transversely and
distally bifid prezygapophyses (also in eudromaeosaurs). <br>
(after Hattori et al., 2021) large maxillary fenestra expanded well
dorsally above suprantral strut; jugal anterior process with thick and
rounded dorsal margin continuous with lateral surface; bifid posterior
end of ectopterygoid for contact with pterygoid.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Azuma et al. (2016) listed "unusually
large external naris (slightly smaller than antorbital fenestra in
dorsoventral height)" as diagnostic, but this was based on the
misidentified right maxilla's antorbital fenestra being mistaken for an
external naris.  Another proposed character "large premaxillary
[sic] fenestra subequal in size to maxillary fenestra" is untrue as the
photo indicates the promaxillary fenestra is ~43% the length of the
maxillary fenestra, though both have some broken margins. The character
"lacrimal with a distinct groove on lateral surface of anterior process
and a ridge on lateral surface of descending process" is not valid
given the reidentification of the anterior process as the ventral
process and vice versa.  They also list "postorbital frontal
process with T-shaped cross section and laterally-flanged squamosal
process", but does the first part indicate the postorbital process of
the frontal or the frontal (i.e. anterior) process of the postorbital?
Similarly, the squamosal process of the postorbital has no obvious
flange in the figure. They list "dorsoventrally bifurcated sacral ribs"
as being diagnostic, but this is true in e.g. the middle four sacrals
of ornithomimosaurs (e.g. <i>Deinocheirus,</i> <i>Gallimimus</i>) and
<i>Suzhousaurus</i> and the fourth sacral of <i>Zuolong</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in Summer 2007, and initially announced as a dromaeosaurid
(Anonymous, 2009; Shibata and Azuma, 2010), this was later described by
Azuma et al. on February 23 2016 as a new taxon of basal
coelurosaur.  However, this paper has no mention of ZooBank and as
of December 1 2024
"Fukuivenator" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.  Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Fukuivenator paradoxus" Azuma
et al., 2016 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically.<br>
The initial description of "Fukuivenator" included several problematic
interpretations and assertions (Mortimer, 2016 online), many cleared up
in the detailed redescription by Hattori et al. (2021).  Contra
Azuma et al., it cannot be determined if the premaxillary subnarial
process extends posterior to the external naris like in dromaeosaurids,
as the anterior maxillary surface shows no differentiation of
premaxillary vs. nasal sutures and the tip of the process itself (and
indeed the entire premaxilla) is missing. The text claims the lacrimal
is T-shaped, but the figure shows the posterodorsal process is
unpreserved, and the character is coded scored in their matrix. Hattori
et al. specify this supposed left lacrimal is actually the right
lacrimal, with the apparent ventral process actually being an anterior
process plus tip of the dorsal maxillary process.  The
posterodorsal process of the reinterpreted lacrimal is still very short
regardless.  Although the authors claim the frontals have
dromaeosaurid-like anterolateral notches, Hattori et al.'s figures show
they do not. The fenestra labeled "IX?" in figure 4 is the otic
fenestra, the basipterygoid processes are labeled as laterosphenoids
twice in that figure, and the supposed medial eustachian foramina are
the paired foramina of the basisphenoid recess, all corrected by
Hattori et al.. Azuma et al.'s description states "ten cervical
vertebrae are preserved, missing at least the atlas" but the materials
list only says "eight cervical vertebrae" are present, and Hattori et
al. reveal nine cervicals are preserved "missing 4th and 7th" with the
atlantal neurapophyses having been initially identified as axial ribs.
Azuma et al. say "likely pleurocoels are present in all dorsal
vertebrae in the form of longitudinal fossae on the lateral surfaces of
centra", but only foramina are considered pleurocoels by most authors,
and Hattori et al. find that not even the anteriormost dorsals have
pleurocoels. Thus this character was incorrectly scored as
dromaeosaurid-like. Azuma et al. also state "the parapophyses of the
dorsal vertebrae including the posterior ones are stalk-like as in
derived alvarezsauroids and dromaeosaurids, though they are not as
prominent as in the latter groups", but they're actually short. Those
authors also say "the most unusual feature is that the prezygapophyses
of the middle caudal vertebrae are distally bifid (Fig. 6i), which has
not been reported in any dinosaurs", but this is a standard
dromaeosaurid character reported in e.g. <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>.
Contra the text
and scoring, the coracoid is proximodistally shallow, unlike
pennaraptorans. Figure 7's caption is incorrect and the humeri shown
are a right in anterior view and left in lateral view, not the left "in
lateral (left) and posterior (right) view." Also, the femur in figure
7f is in medial and posterior views, not lateral and posterior. In
figure 7h, the pedal phalanges are placed incorrectly, with II-1 and
II-2 switched with IV-1 and IV-2.  The measurement table is partly
inconsistent as it has IV-2 subequal to IV-3 and IV-4 in length, unlike
the figure. Hattori et al. agree with this based on their figures and
description, but their materials list incorrectly says supposed IV-2 is
actually III-2 and supposed III-1 is actually II-2, which besides just
being wrong anatomically and in their own figures would leave us with
an extra III-2 and no III-1. Contra the text and coding, I don't think
the second pedal digit looks particularly deinonychosaurian- <i>Tanycolagreus</i>
has the same dorsally prominent distal articular surface on II-1, and
the ungual in <i>Ornitholestes</i>
is comparatively larger.  Hattori et al. also list the folowing
"Re-identified elements: right maxilla, originally identified as right
premaxilla; ... partial neural arch of fifth dorsal vertebra,
originally identified as left squamosal; right manual phalanx III-1,
originally identified as right pedal phalanx I-1; right pubis,
originally identified as left pubis; left metatarsals II and V,
originally identified as right metatarsals IV and V,
respectively."  They list the following "Additionally identified
elements: right quadrate; both parietals; right ectopterygoid; centrum
of 2nd dorsal vertebra; neural spine of 9th dorsal vertebra; partial
neural arch of 4th caudal vertebra; prezygapophyses of 18th caudal
vertebra; 29th caudal vertebra; several rib elements; distal end of
right humerus; left manual phalanx I-2; left femoral head; distal part
of right fibula; right distal tarsal III; left metatarsal III; right
metatarsal IV; left pedal phalanx I-2".  Finally, they list three
"Withdrawn elements:
left pterygoid; posterior caudal vertebra; left ischium" without
comment, but Hattori (pers. comm. 3-4-2022) indicates the pterygoid and
ischium cannot be identified in the existing materials and that the
caudal is theropodan but not part of the holotypic block.<br>
Azuma et al. (2016) add "Fukuivenator" to Turner et al.'s TWiG matrix
and recover it as a coelurosaur in a polytomy with compsognathids, <i>Ornitholestes</i>,
ornithomimosaurs and maniraptorans, contra their statements that they
found the taxon to be a basal maniraptoran. Experimentation shows the
polytomy exists regardless of "Fukuivenator"'s
presence in the tree. Azuma et al. find that constraining the genus to
be a paravian, deinonychosaur or dromaeosaurid only takes three more
steps. As indicated above, many of the supposedly dromaeosaurid-like
characters are incorrectlyscored.  Cau (2018) recovered the taxon
as either the most basal
paravian or a basal dromaeosaurid.  More recently, Hartman et al.
(2019) found "Fukuivenator"
to be the basalmost alvarezsauroid, though it moves to a basal
therizinosaurian position in only two steps.  A more stemward
position seems more likely than a relationship with dromaeosaurids, as
it can be a coelurid with only 4 more steps, but takes 7 steps to be
sister to Pennaraptora and 11 steps to be paravian.  Forcing it to
be a dromaeosaurid is 27 steps longer, so is extremely unlikely. 
Hattori et al. (2021) in their redescription added it to a later TWiG
matrix and recovered it as the basalmost therizinosaurian, while adding
it to Hartman et al.'s analysis using the new data results in it being
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> with
this pair sister to Maniraptoriformes.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Zhao (1983) named Ornithomimoidea as a new superfamily of toothless
Late Cretaceous coelurosaurs which excluded podokesaurids and
coelurids. It was later used by Sereno (1999) as an arctometatarsalian
clade containing ornithomimosaurs and alvarezsauroids, but not
therizinosaurs.  Sereno (2017) redefined it to include
ornithomimosaurs closer to ornithomimids than <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>,
but as the latter is an alvarezsauroid here, his Ornithomimoidea is a
junior synonym of Ornithomimosauria here.  Hendrickx et al. (2019)
redefined it to refer "to toothless ornithomimosaurs, which includes
the 'family'-level clades Ornithomimidae and Deinocheiridae", but the
Hartman et al matrix found <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>
to be sister to toothed <span style="font-style: italic;">Hexing</span>,
further from toothless ornithomimids than toothed <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Shenzhousaurus</span>.  Thus all
ornithomimosaurs are covered under their definition of (<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus mirificus</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus velox</span>) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span> is convergently
toothless.<br>
Paul (1988) used Protoavia for a clade conatining what are today
recognized as maniraptoriforms, which would also correspond to the
modern definition of Coelurosauria in his topology. The name has not
seen much use since, and is inadvisable due to the eponymous <i>Protoavis</i>
being a chimaera of taxa less closely related to birds.<br>
Holtz (1992) originally named Eumaniraptora in his unpublished thesis,
but used it for what would now be called Maniraptoriformes- a clade
containing paravians, oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and also
tyrannosaurids, but not <i>Ornitholestes</i> or <i>Compsognathus</i>. 
He also named "Pneumatocrania" there, to contain his Arctometatarsalia
(caenagnathids, <i>Avimimus</i>, tyrannosaurids, troodontids and
ornithomimosaurs) plus oviraptorids, though the name was left out of
the 1994 published version. No subsequent analysis has recovered this
group, which seems largely based on miscodings.<br>
In the late 1980s and 1990s, a sister group relationship between
ornithomimosaurs and troodontids was popular based on the bulbous
cultriform process and dental anatomy of <i>Pelecanimimus</i>. This
was formalized by Holtz (1994) as the clade Bullatosauria, defined by
him in 1996. The discovery of basal troodontids like <i>Sinovenator</i>
showed they were ancestrally bird-like, and bullatosaurs have not been
supported by many studies since. While Bullatosauria predates
Maniraptoriformes and was defined in the same publication, its limited
concept has led to the widespread use of Maniraptoriformes for the now
far more inclusive <i>Ornithomimus</i>+<i>Troodon</i> clade. <br>
<b>Maniraptoriformes defined</b>-
Holtz and Padian (1995) define Maniraptoriformes as "the node
connecting Arctometatarsalia with Maniraptora", but since their
Maniraptora was a node-based taxon of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
plus birds, the modern node-stem triplet wasn't formed yet.<br>
Unlike Turner et al. (2012), Maryanska et al. (2002) used <i>Ornithomimus
velox</i>, the type species, as dictated by Phylocode. To illustrate
why this is a good idea, consider the fact that Makovicky et al. (2004)
synonymized <i>O. edmontonicus</i> with <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>. They
listed the species as <i>O. edmontonicus</i>, but <i>brevitertius</i>
has priority, so the species should be <i>Ornithomimus brevitertius</i>.
<i>Ornithomimus velox</i>, on the other hand, remains valid. Makovicky
et al. also considered the possibility <i>O. brevitertius</i> (as <i>O.
edmontonicus</i>) may be a junior synonym of <i>O. velox</i>, and
deCourten and Russell (1985) suggested it (again as <i>O. edmontonicus</i>)
may warrant generic separation from <i>O. velox</i> if the specimen
they describe is properly referred to the latter species. Then Turner
et al.'s redefinitions of taxa eponymous with <i>Ornithomimus</i>
would not be based on <i>Ornithomimus</i>. Sereno also used <i>edmontonicus</i>
online and claims <i>O. edmontonicus</i> is the taxon represented by
most analyses, not <i>O. velox</i>, but only the TWG matrix (from Ji
et al., 2003 onward) and Kobayashi's work (Kobayashi and Lu, 2003;
Kobayashi, 2004; Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005; Kobayashi and Barsbold,
2005) have used <i>Ornithomimus</i> as an OTU, and the latter uses
both species as references. So this is not a valid rationale.<br>

but as pointed out by Averianov and Sues (2007) this is also known in
other maniraptoriforms (e.g. deinocheirids, derived alvarezsauroids,
caenagnathids, some oviraptorids, some unenlagiids, most
dromaeosaurids, most avialans).<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Maniraptora was first named by Gauthier (1984) in his unpublished
thesis, using a cladistic philosophy but no quantitative
analysis.  Proposed as "birds and all coelurosaurs that are closer
to birds than they are to Ornithomimidae" (p297), it included Avialae,
Deinonychosauria (with <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span> as different
OTUs), oviraptorosaurs (as Caenagnathidae, Elmisauridae and <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span>), <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>. 
Gauthier and Padian (1985) later presented this concept in published
form, albeit without naming the deinonychosaur plus bird clade. 
The full analysis with data matrix was published by Gauthier (1986),
although my reanalysis shows <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
only fell out as maniraptorans there due to misscorings (see Evaluating
Phylogenetic Analyses).  This concept of grouping oviraptorosaurs,
deinonychosaurs and birds to the exclusion of ornithomimosaurs,
carnosaurs and coelophysoids was rather novel for the time.  For
one thing, few explicit hypotheses of theropod relationships included
birds until the 1990s.  On the other hand, Paul (1984, 1988) was
noncommital with regard to ornithomimosaur relationships, viewing them
as potentially closer to birds than <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
and dromaeosaurids.  Thulborn (1984) would only count <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> and birds as maniraptoran,
with troodontids being closer to ornithomimids, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>,
oviraptorosaurs and dromaeosaurids outside what would now be
Maniraptoriformes.  Bakker's (1986) dinosaur family tree in the
non-technical book "The Dinosaur Heresies" does show dromaeosaurs
closer to birds than ornithomimids or tyrannosaurs however.  <br>
In the 1990s it was common to place troodontids, oviraptorosaurs (at
least caenagnathids and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>),
therizinosaurs, alvarezsauroids and/or tyrannosauroids in the sister
clade to Maniraptora- Arctometatarsalia, those taxa closer to
ornithomimosaurs than to birds.  The discovery of bird-like basal
oviraptorosaurs and troodontids around 2000, like <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinovenator</span>,
led to these clades confidently being placed in Maniraptora, while the
discovery of more coelurid-like basal tyrannosauroids lessened that
superfamily's similarity to ornithomimosaurs.  Alvarezsauroids and
therizinosaurs are still controversial members however, moving to be
arctometatarsalians with 4 steps in the matrix of Hartman et al.
(2019).  While usually ignored due to the homogeniety of TWiG
results, these two clades can plausibly be arctometatarsalians in Cau's
(2018) matrix as well, with only 5 and 6 steps respectively. 
While more stemward coelurosaurs like <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span>
are still recovered as maniraptorans in some analyses, Hartman et al.'s
results suggest these are unlikely to be correct, requiring 8, 13 and
13 more steps respectively.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Therizinosaurs plus oviraptorosaurs?</span>-
For a time, a clade of therizinosaurs plus oviraptorosaurs seemed
likely, beginning with the results of Makovicky's (1995) axial analysis
and being common until Zanno's 2010 osteology of <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>
and revision of Therizinosauria.  Naish et al. (2001) named
Enigmosauria in a cladogram for this concept. It was not defined or
mentioned in the text, as the
authors had only accidentally left in in the figure after they decided
not to formally name the clade in that publication.  Other defined
names that could function for this clade include Caenagnathiformes and
Oviraptoriformes (see comments for Oviraptorosauria).  Such a
pairing now seems
unlikely however, considering Hartman et al. (2019) requires 13 steps
to enforce
it.<br>
<b>Maniraptora defined</b>- Holtz (1994) has been the only
author to attempt to explicitly change the content of Maniraptora to
include ornithimosaurs in his topology.  Correctly predicting
ornithomimosaurs and tyrannosaurids evolved from ancestors with the
namesake 'snatching hands' of Maniraptora, Holtz changed the definition
to be "the first theropod possessing the derived fore limb structures
described by Gauthier (including a semilunate carpal structure, a thin
narrow metacarpal III, and bowed ulna) and its descendants."  This
covered all theropods in his cladogram except <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span>. 
As is usual for apomorphy-based definitions, this one has issues with
ambiguous character definition and homoplasy, compounded here by using
three independent features.  For instance, in the Hartman et al.
(2019) matrix a semilunate carpal (defined by its deep semicircular
shape) is recovered as a pennaraptoran character convergent in
therizinosaurians and derived alvarezsauroids (due to its absence in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pelecanimimus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>).  A bowed
ulna is ambiguous though, as the most basal therizinosaur and
alvarezsauroid (<span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>)
have one but other members of those clades don't.  The degree of
slenderness in metacarpal III is never specified, making it more
difficult to comment on.  In any case, Holtz saw this folly and
changed it to a node-based definition the next year.<br>
That and the other two node-based definitions listed here all have the
same thing in common- they function to recover the same known content
as Gauthier's definition, but only in their respective
topologies.  So for example, Sereno's (1998) definition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Passer</span>
works in his topology where oviraptorosaurs are the first branching
maniraptorans, and alvarezsauroids and therizinosaurs are
arctometatarsalians.  But in most topologies such as Hartman et
al.'s, this defines a maniraptoran subgroup subsequently named
Pennaraptora.  Similarly, Holtz and Padian's (1995) definition
worked in their topology that had even oviraptorosaurs and troodontids
in Arctometatarsalia, but the dromaeosaurid plus bird clade was named
Eumaniraptora two years later by those same authors.  Fianally,
Choiniere et al. (2010) had <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
as the basalmost maniraptoran, but their definition would encompass all
Maniraptoromorpha in Hartman et al.'s tree.<br>
See the comments under Maniraptoriformes for why Turner et al.'s (2012)
definition of Maniraptora using <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</i> is
inferior to Maryanska et al.'s (2002) using <i>O. velox</i>.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK A1588) distal tibiotarsus (37.8 mm wide)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was originally referred to <i>Elopteryx</i>
(Lambrecht, 1929, 1933), then considered a pelecaniform. Harrison and
Walker (1975) later separated the material and named <i>Bradycneme </i>as
a new taxon of strigiform. Later authors agreed <i>Bradycneme </i>was
a non-avian theropod, beginning with Brodkorb (1978). Glut (1982) notes
Brett-Surman proposed it was non-avian
at the 1978 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, "an opinion
supported by Dr. Storrs Olson and Dr. R. T. Bakker."  Martin
(1983) suggested it was ornithomimid. Paul (1988) and Osmólska and
Barsbold (1990) thought it was troodontid. Le Loeuff et al. (1992)
suggested it was synonymous with <i>Elopteryx</i>, which they placed
in the Dromaeosauridae. Csiki and Grigorescu (1998) made <i>Heptasteornis</i>
a junior synonym and proposed it was a non-maniraptoran tetanurine.
Naish and Dyke (2004) noted the craniocaudally compressed rectangular
shape in distal view was similar to maniraptorans, while the astragalar
ascending process lacks the alvarezsaurid notched medial margin seen in
<i>Heptasteornis</i>. They thus assigned <i>Bradycneme</i> to
Maniraptora indet..  Most recently, Hartman et al. (2019) scored <span style="font-style: italic;">Bradycneme</span> in their phylogenetic
analysis and found it emerges as a maniraptoran excluded from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>, Therizinosauria,
Oviraptorosauria and Deinonychosauria.  This makes an
alvarezsauroid or avialan identity most likely<br>

Material</b>- (MPG-KPC24; holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Camarillasaurus
cirugedae</span> in part) incomplete anterior dorsal centrum (~30 mm)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Sanchez-Hernandez and
Benton (2014) said this "may belong to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Camarillasaurus</span>
skeleton, having been collected in close proximity to the other
elements", interpreting it as the posterior half of an anterior
cervical centrum.  Wang et al. (2016) noted it "most likely
represents an anterior dorsal based on
the position of the parapophyses and presence of a hypapophysis" and
that "the morphology of the hypapophysis in <span style="font-style: italic;">Camarillasaurus</span> more
strongly resembles those found in some coelurosaurs (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Nomingia</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>) than the structure on
dorsal 1 of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>." 
Samathi (2019) found "It is too small to belong to the same individual
or even the same taxon as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Camarillasaurus</span>", and Samathi
et al. (2021) excluded the element from
the type material.  Contra both Sanchez-Hernandez and Benton and
Samathi et al., the preserved articular surface is the anterior one, as
it is adjacent to the parapophysis.  Also, the labeled
parapophyses in figure 3B are the neural arch peduncles and the
supposed
pneumatic foramen is merely a fossa.  The combination of large
hypapophysis, concave to flat anterior articular surface and no dorsal
pleurocoels suggests a basal alvarezsauroid, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mahakala</span> relative, troodontid or
pygostylian, so it is here assigned to Maniraptora.<br>

and Clark, 1993<b><br>
Definition-</b> (<i>Mononykus olecranus</i> + <i>Passer domesticus</i>)
(modified from Chiappe, 1995)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Metornithes was named by Perle et al. (1993) for a
clade containing <i>Mononykus</i> and Ornithothoraces, but not <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and non-bird theropods. Chiappe (1995) was the first author to define
the clade, making it a node containing <i>Mononykus</i> and
Neornithes. Under the current topology it's a maniraptoran clade that
may contain therizinosaurs, though if alvarezsauroids are
arctometatarsalians (4 more steps in Hartman et al., 2019 analysis) it
will be a senior synonym of Maniraptoriformes.<br>
Paul
(2016) used the informal name therizinosauriforms for
"jeholornids, therizinosaurians, and avians and their common ancestor,
operative only if three groups form a clade that excludes all other
dinosaurs except oviraptorosaurs."  This would correspond to a
clade 'Therizinosauriformes' which has never been published, and using
"all other
dinosaurs except oviraptorosaurs" as a specifier would be
problematic.  In addition such a clade would be highly
unparsimonious, and indeed Paul's
listed characters are either meaningless ("Head somewhat elongated",
"Tail from very long to very short", "[semi]lunate carpal from well to
poorly developed", "three to four load-bearing toes"), absent in
therizinosaurs ("teeth ... not serrated", "Gastroliths often
present"), absent in jeholornithids ("teeth ... blunt,
leaf shaped"), or vague and/or also present in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Sapeornis</span> ("blunt upper beak, extra
joint in lower jaw absent, teeth small", "Arm long", "Foot not narrow").<br>

therizinosaurs and alvarezsauroids exclusive of ornithomimosaurs or

could be aractometatarsalians in 4 more steps and therizinosaurs could
be closer to Pennaraptora in 3 steps, so this group requires more
testing.  Definitions listed above for alvarezsauroid or
therizinosaur clades were made without considering they could be sister

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after de Klerk et al., 2000) ginglymus of metacarpal
I very robust and asymmetrical, with hypertrophied articular surfaces
and greatly enlarged lateral condyle; metatarsal IV reduced in width to
approximately half that of metatarsal III.<br>
(after Choiniere et al., 2012b) ridge on the lateral margin of the
dorsal surface of the distal end of metacarpal I extending proximally
from lateral condyle.<br>
(after Sereno, 2017) well defined, elongate beveled edge on orbital rim
anterior to postorbital; elongate dorsal centra (length approximately 3
times  centrum diameter); long manual unguals II and III (the
latter more than twice the length of III-3).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Sereno (2017)
stated neither 'manual ungual I elongate (length is four times proximal
depth) and mediolaterally compressed' nor 'fibular shaft reduced
distally to thin splint', listed in de Klerk et al.'s (2000) diagnosis
were autapomorphic.  <br>
Choiniere et al.'s (2012b) proposed diagnostic dental characters
(unserrated maxillary teeth set into a groove; straight maxillary tooth
crowns; maxillary tooth crowns conical) are typical of alvarezsauroids.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was discovered in 1996.  The maxilla was originally
misidentified as a palatine by de Klerk et
al. (2000) before Choiniere et al. (2012b) more fully described the
skull.  Radermacher et al. (2021) used microCT scanning to reveal
new elements "including the jugal, lacrimal, postorbital, squamosal,
quadrate, pterygoid, palatine, prootic, parabasisphenoid, surangular,
angular, prearticular, articular; as well as finer details of the
already-known dentition, maxilla, prefrontal, frontal, and
parietal."  Contra de Klerk et al., no caudal vertebral material
is
preserved (Sereno, 2017).<br>
This taxon was described as a basal coelurosaur, and found to occupy
such a position in the analyses of Holtz et al. (2004) and Rauhut and
Xu (2005). The latter analyses found the taxon more derived than
compsognathids, but outside Tyrannoraptora and Maniraptora. Holtz et
al. furthermore found it to clade with <i>Ornitholestes</i>,
while Gishlick and Gauthier (2007) noted manual resemblences to
compsognathids and Novas et al. (2012) found it to fall out in that
family. Sereno (2001) noted manual characters shared with
ornithomimosaurs and alvarezsaurids.  Dal Sasso and Maganuco
(2011) and Lee et al. (2014) recovered it as sister to alvarezsaurids.
Choiniere et al. (2012b) included new cranial data and found <i>Nqwebasaurus</i>
to be a basal ornithomimosaur, as in Brusatte et al. (2014), though it
was an alvarezsauroid in trees only 4 steps longer.  Hartman et
al. (2019) recovered it as an alvarezsauroid intermediate between
"Fukuivenator" and <span style="font-style: italic;">Pelecanimimus</span>,
requiring 6 steps to move to Ornithomimosauria.  A compsognathid
position requires 10 steps, and a position sister to Pennaraptora 7
steps.  Radermacher et al. (2021) incorporated new cranial data
into Choiniere's TWiG analysis and still recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>
as a basal ornithomimosaur, while adding some of this data to Hartman
et al.'s analysis results in it being the basalmost member of the
alvarezsaur-therizinosaur clade.  <br>

feathers arising from the distal forelimbs and tail as in <i>Passer

<b>Comments</b>- Ji et al. (1998) found a topology where <i>Caudipteryx</i>
was more closely related to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, alvarezsaurids and
ornithothoracines than <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>
were. In their online supplementary information, they call a section
"Diagnoses of the Chuniaoae and the Avialae under alternative
optimizations," but go on to list characters for Avialae and an
"Unnamed clade of <i>Caudipteryx</i> + Avialae." Thus it seems the
authors originally intended to name their new clade Chuniaoae, then
decided to leave it unnamed, but didn't catch all the times they used
the name. The concept is invalid, as <i>Caudipteryx</i> is now
recognized as an oviraptorosaur, and two of the proposed chuniaoaen
characters (posteriorly extensive external nares; unserrated teeth) are
maniraptoran symplesiomorphies that were reversed in derived
dromaeosaurids and present in <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>, while the
other one (posteriorly extensive dorsal premaxillary process) is
convergent between some oviraptorosaurs and some birds. A <i>Caudipteryx</i>+Avialae
clade would now include all oviraptorosaurs and paravians, being a
subset of Maniraptora potentially excluding taxa which are placed as
basal maniraptorans in some studies (e.g. therizinosaurs,
alvarezsauriods, <i>Ornitholestes</i>). Note Ji and Ji (2001) later
proposed a similar name (Chuniaoia) on a cladogram for a group
containing <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>, but not birds. Martyniuk (2012)
later defined the clade as <i>Caudipteryx</i> plus <i>Passer</i>, but
it has seen almost no use outside of that volume.<br>
Ji and Ji (2001) erected the taxon Dromavialae in a cladogram for a
maniraptoran group including <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and pygostylians, but not <i>Oviraptor</i>, <i>Troodon</i> or
dromaeosaurids. The text suggests <i>Caudipteryx</i> would be included
as well. Dromavialae is invalid content-wise, since <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>
and <i>Caudipteryx</i> are now recognized as oviraptorosaurs, which
are agreed by most authors to be further from birds than dromaeosaurids
are. The diagnostic feature of the clade is listed as "real wings with
symmetrical feathers of modern concept." This is now known to be true
in oviraptorosaurs, troodontids and dromaeosaurids as well, meaning
Dromavialae could be viewed as a junior synonym of Maniraptora. <br>
Gauthier and de Quieroz (2001) stated that if phylogeny expressed the
developmental origin of feathers, additional clades could be named
including Aviremigia, which they defined using feather apomorphies.
Martyniuk (2012) followed them, and is credited here as his use was
definite as opposed to conditional. While ornithomimosaurs are now
known to lack feathers with barbules or retrices (based on <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>),
the condition in therizinosaurs and alvarezsauroids is still uncertain,
giving Aviremigia an uncertain position in the present topology.<br>
Foth et al. (2014) erected Pennaraptora for this clade, which is
followed here due to the lack of use for Chuniaoae, Dromavialae or
Aviremigia, the uncertain applicability of Aviremigia, and the fact
Chuniaoae originally had a very different concept. <br>
Paul (2016) creates the term aveairfoilan for taxa "with feather wings
or ancestors with same that are in the clade that includes extant
birds", in his topology including therizinosaurs and what are here
pennaraptorans except for scansoriopterygids.  His concept seems
to be that scasnsoriopterygid membrane wings evolved parallel to
feather wings, and members with the latter character are aveairfoilan,
though Paul never uses the technical term 'Aveairfoila' that is
implied.  No other publication has used the term either, so that
it remains informal, and difficult to apply given the uncertain
relationships and forelimb feathering in therizinosaurs,
alvarezsauroids and ornithomimosaurs.  Paul (2024) continues his
use of the informal term for maniraptorans excluding scansoriopterygids
(and including alvarezsauroids and therizinosaurs), although this time
he defines aveairfoilans as "airfoilans with avian shoulder girdles, or
ancestors with same that are in the clade that includes extant birds",
which seems like a retooling of his 2002 Avepectora.  It's
debatable where between Maniraptoriformes and Eumaniraptora this
evolved , but in any case 'Aveairfoila' is still not used  and so
is still informal eight years later. <br>
Paul (2024) creates the term airfoilan for "neocoelurosaurs with
forelimb-borne airfoils of some form, or ancestors with same that are
in the clade that includes extant birds", consisting of traditional
maniraptorans (including alvarezsauroids and therizinosaurs). 
Thus content-wise this should be under Maniraptora, but definition-wise
alvarezsauroids and therizinosaurs cannot be scored yet, so the name
has an uncertain position similar to Aviremigia.  The difference
is that Paul includes scansoriopterygid membrane wings as
"forelimb-borne airfoils of some form", but if scansoriopterygids were
truly outside the clade of taxa with feather-based airfoils as Paul
suggests it makes no sense to homologize membrane and feather wings as
a shared evolutionary development.  In any case, the implied
technical term 'Airfoila' is never used and as no other publication has
used the term for a theropod clade either,
it remains informal.<br>

only stated to share general characteristics with <i>Elopteryx</i>
(reduced fourth trochanter, posterior trochanter, "shape and size")
while differing in having a linear capital ligament fossa and absent
fourth trochanter. It probably belongs to a distinct taxon of
pennaraptoran.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The humerus was originally a paratype of <i>Zhyraornis
kashkarovi</i> (Nessov, 1984). Kurochkin (1996) later disagreed, since
the nutrient foramen is located on the ventral shaft, apparently unlike
enantiornithines (in which he included <i>Zhyraornis</i>). The
specimen preserves almost no morphological features, besides being
slender and curved with a thin-walled shaft. Scaled to <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
it might measure ~73 mm when complete. It is thus large enough to come
from a deinonychosaur or oviraptorosaur in addition to a bird, and
certainly preserves no characters which could exclude this possibility.
It is here referred to Pennaraptora indet. Isolated shafts of long
bones (TsNIGRI 48/11915, 49/11915 and 50/11915) were also made
paratypes of <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>. These were not described or
illustrated, and are similarly referred to Pennaraptora indet.. <br>
Nessov and Panteleev (1993) figured and described a partial sacrum they
referred to <i>Kuszholia</i> sp. (ZIN PO 4826). Zelenkov and Averianov
(2011) stated this differs from <i>Kuszholia</i> in "the absence of a
pleurocoel in the posterior vertebra and in the shallow slitlike
pleurocoel in the penultimate vertebra", and while the pleurocoel shape
appears similar, the absence of a pleurocoel in the last sacral is
indeed different. They believe the specimen to be similar to <i>Zanabazar</i>,
but I don't see any particular resemblence and refer it to Pennaraptora
incertae sedis here pending further study. <br>
CCMGE 459/12457 was listed in the text as being an oviraptorosaur by
Nessov (1995), in which case it may be referrable to <i>Kuszholia</i>
from the same formation. Nessov also listed the possibility of it being
a bird pedal ungual in the figure caption however.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Britt (1993) mentions NMV 186303 (the holotype femur

Benson et al. (2012) could not distinguish it from paravians or
oviraptorosaurs, and it is here left as Pennaraptora incertae sedis

NMV P186323 was originally a paratype of <i>Timimus hermani</i>,

<b>Late Berriasian-Early Barremian, Early Cretaceous<br>

Syntypes </b>- (LP-715 IEI) body feather (27 mm)<br>
(LP-1327 IEI) body feather <br>
(LP IEI coll.) seven body feathers (20-30 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- These feathers have barbules, so are probably from
pennaraptorans. They may be from <i>Noguerornis</i> or the unnamed La
Pedrera juvenile enantiornithine taxon which are from the same
locality. Whether all of the nine feathers are from the same taxon is
unknown, and <i>Ilerdopteryx</i> is indeterminate since feathers are
undiagnostic for Mesozoic theropods.<br>
