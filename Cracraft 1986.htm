<p>Several taxa have uncertain placements. Enantiornithes is more derived than 
  Hesperornithes, but excluded from Palaeognathae. <i>Ambiortus</i> and <i>Alexornis</i> 
  are more derived than Hesperornithes, but are excluded from Ratites. Cracraft 
  favored a position for <i>Gobipteryx</i> sister to Palaeognathae, though the 
  trees are ambiguous in this regard.</p>
<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Theropods- Cracraft recognizes this is paraphyletic relative to birds and codes 
  it based on four taxa- <i>Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Gallimimus</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>, 
  though he says he also examined <i>Oviraptor</i>, <i>Saurornithoides</i> and 
  other theropods.<br>
  Hesperornithiformes- This is generally called Hesperornithes today, and Cracraft 
  only includes <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i> (including material now 
  referred to <i>Parahesperornis</i>). While Cracraft does note <i>Enaliornis</i> 
  as a hesperornithine, he does not seem to use it for coding purposes.<br>
  Enantiornithes- Cracraft only included the remains from the Lecho Formation 
  described by Walker (1981), some of which was named <i>Enantiornis</i> at the 
  time, and others which have later been named <i>Lectavis</i>, <i>Yungavolucris</i>, 
  <i>Soroavisaurus</i> and <i>Martinavis vincei</i>. This clade is unlikely to 
  be monophyletic compared to <i>Alexornis</i> and <i>Gobipteryx</i>, which were 
  recognized as enantiornithines by Martin (1983), but Cracraft was testing the 
  idea here instead of assuming it.<br>
  <i>Gobipteryx</i>- Cracraft included the embryos described by Elzanowski (1981) 
  in <i>Gobipteryx</i>, but these have recently been called &quot;Gobipipus&quot; 
  instead.<br>
  Neognathae- Cracraft notes he used eight neognath families- Anatidae, Megapodiidae, 
  Gruidae, Gaviidae, Spheniscidae, Diomedeidae, Scopidae and Laridae, though he 
  examined &quot;most families of nonpasserine birds&quot; as well.</p>
<p><b>Coding Issues</b></p>
<p>1. While feathers are unpreserved for <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>, 
  their presence in other maniraptoriforms indicates they were near certainly 
  present. Still, the outgroup is left coded as having scales since this was unknown 
  in 1986, and <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> both preserve scales.</p>
<p>2. While Cracraft states teeth are present in all the outgroups, <i>Gallimimus</i> 
  lacks them. <b>Theropods</b> are thus coded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>3. Contra Cracraft <i>Gallimimus</i> lacks a coronoid (Hurum, 2001), so <b>theropods</b> 
  are coded polymorphic. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is now known to probably lack a 
  coronoid (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996), <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is unknown 
  due to a fragmented medial mandibular surface, and <i>Ichythyornis</i> has a 
  coronoid (Clarke, 2004).</p>
<p>4. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to have a incompletely fused tarsometatarsus 
  (Kurochkin, 1996). As noted under character 25, theropods are recoded as unknown 
  since they lack any metatarsal fusion.</p>
<p>5. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to lack a supratendinal bridge (Kurochkin, 
  1996), as does <i><b>Apteryx</b></i> (McGowan, 1979).</p>
<p>6. This character (sternum keeled) is dependent on an ossified sternum being 
  present (character 29), so all taxa without an ossified sternum (<i><b>Allosaurus, 
  Tyrannosaurus, Gallimimus</b></i> and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>) are recoded 
  as unknown. </p>
<p>7. Among the <b>outgroup</b>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  (Novas, 2004) have large antitrochanters, so it is rescored polymorphic. <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  is now known to lack a significant antitrochanter (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>8. Notably, <i>Enaliornis</i> has a true double-headed quadrate, but Hesperornithes 
  is left scored as 0 because that taxon wasn't explicitly used by Cracraft for 
  scoring purposes.</p>
<p>9. <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> can not be coded for the quadrate-quadratojugal 
  articulation morphology, since this area is broken off in the holotype. </p>
<p>10. See character 72 for why theropods are recoded as unknown for this character.</p>
<p>11. This character (less than ten caudal vertebrae) is correlated with character 
  10 (less than twenty caudal vertebrae), so all taxa scored 0 for character 10 
  (theropods, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>), should be scored as unknown for this one. 
</p>
<p>12. A pygostyle is seemingly unknown for the Lecho <b>enantiornithine</b> material, 
  while <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to have one (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>14. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> has a partially fused pelvis (pubis and ischium coosified- 
  Brochu, 2003), but theropods are left plesiomorphic since the other taxa lack 
  any fusion. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to have at least a partially unfused 
  pelvis, but is left uncoded.</p>
<p>15. Livezey and Zusi (2007) code <b>rheas</b> as having a pubic symphysis.</p>
<p>17. <b>Hesperornithines</b> are here coded polymorphic for as strut-like coracoid, 
  since <i>Baptornis</i> has that morphology (Martin and Tate, 1976).</p>
<p>18. The Lecho <b>enantiornithine</b> PVL-4032-3 lacks most of the pubis (Chiappe 
  and Walker, 2002), making it impossible to judge whether it was moderately opisthopubic 
  or subparallel to the ilium. This is correlated with character 35 (at least 
  moderately opisthopubic pelvis), so taxa without opisthopuby (<i>Allosaurus, 
  Tyrannosaurus</i> and <i>Gallimimus</i>) should be coded unknown. Theropods 
  are still plesiomorphic since <i>Deinonychus</i> was weakly opisthopubic though.</p>
<p>19. <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is too fragmentary to be coded for the absence 
  of gastralia (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>20. <b>Theropods</b> are polymorphic for the presence of a furcula, since <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> have them (Chure and Madsen, 1996; Larson and Rigby, 
  2005). <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Ambiortus</i> have furculae (Clarke, 2004; 
  Kurochkin, 1999), while <i>Hesperornis</i> only has unfused clavicles (Marsh, 
  1888). All five <b>ratite</b> OTUs lack fused clavicles as well (Livezey and 
  Zusi, 2007).</p>
<p>21. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to have a distally reduced fibula (Kurochkin, 
  1996).</p>
<p>22. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> lacks astragalocalcaneal fusion (Wellnhofer, 
  1992), while <i>Gobipteryx</i> is now known to possess it (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>23. Though Ostrom (1976) claimed the distal tarsal in the Maxberg specimen 
  of <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> was &quot;at least partially fused&quot; to the 
  metatarsus, he said the same of the Eichstatt specimen which seems to be untrue. 
  It is also untrue in the Solnhofen specimen (Wellnhofer, 1992). <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  is now known to have this character (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>24. This character (complete distal tarsal - metatarsal fusion) is correlated 
  with character 23 (partial distal tarsal - metatatarsal fusion), but as no included 
  taxon is known to have only partial fusion, it is here deleted and all twelve 
  coded taxa are recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>25. This character (proximally fused tarsometatarsus) is correlated with character 
  4 (completely fused tarsometatarsus), thus any taxa coded as 0 for character 
  25 (theropods) should be coded unknown for character 4. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is 
  now known to have a proximally fused tarsometatarsus (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>26. A &quot;well-developed hypotarsus&quot; is lacking in Lecho enantiornithines 
  (e.g. <i>Lectavis, Yungavolucris, Soroavisaurus</i>; Chiappe, 1993), <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  (Kurochkin, 1996), and the five included <b>ratite</b> taxa (Livezey and Zusi, 
  2007). The condition in <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> is unknown (Clarke, 2004).</p>
<p>27. This character (enclosed distal vascular foramen in metatarsus) can only 
  be true if metatarsals III and IV are distally fused. Thus it is correlated 
  with characters 4 and 25, and all taxa marked 0 for those characters (theropods, 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, Enantiornithes) must be scored as unknown for this character. 
  <b>Hesperornithines</b> should be polymorphic as <i>Baptornis</i> lacks the 
  character (Martin and Tate, 1976), and <i><b>Casuarius</b></i> is coded as lacking 
  it by Livezey and Zusi (2007).</p>
<p>28. Remains of Lecho <b>enantiornithines</b> are too disarticulated to code 
  them as lacking metatarsal V, though <i>Gobipteryx</i> is tentatively coded 
  this way (Kurochkin, 1996). Similarly, remains of <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  are too fragmentary and disarticulated.</p>
<p>29. While <i>Deinonychus</i> probably had an ossified sternum, this is unknown 
  for sure and the other included theropods lacked them. Thus theropods are kept 
  coded as plesiomorphic. </p>
<p>30. <b>Theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic for the presence of ossified 
  uncinate processes, since <i>Deinonychus</i> preserves them (misidentified as 
  gastralia by Ostrom, 1969). </p>
<p>32. This character (uncinate processes fused to ribs) is correlated with character 
  30 (uncinate processes ossified), so taxa coded as lacking 30 (<i>Archaeopteryx</i>) 
  are coded as unknown for character 32. Livezey and Zusi (2007) also code <b>tinamous</b> 
  and <b>kiwis</b> (also in Cracraft and Clarke, 2001) as lacking fusion.</p>
<p>33. Livezey and Zusi (2007) code <b>emus</b> and <b>casuaries</b> as having 
  a fused ilioischial fenestra, which Cracraft noted &quot;in adults of some higher 
  ratites&quot; but coded as absent because he thought a prior it was secondarily 
  derived.</p>
<p>34. The Lecho enantiornithine pelvis appears to lack an obturator foramen (Chiappe 
  and Walker, 2002).</p>
<p>35. <b>Theropods</b> are changed to polymorphic, as <i>Deinonychus</i> has 
  at least a somewhat opisthopubic pelvis. The same is true of the Lecho enantiornithine 
  pelvis (Chiappe and Walker, 2002).</p>
<p>36. <b>Theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic, as <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i> 
  and <i>Deinonychus</i> (Parsons and Parsons, 2009) lack scapulocoracoid fusion. 
  Cracraft notes this for <i>Gallimimus</i>, but still codes the OTU as plesiomorphic. 
</p>
<p>38. While juvenile <i>Baptornis</i> shows Cracraft was right to code hesperornithines 
  as lacking a pretibial process (Chiappe et al., 2007), the condition in <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  cannot be ascertained from available specimens. <i>Gobipteryx</i> is plesiomorphic 
  (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>39. <b>Theropods</b> (<i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>) have extensive 
  vomer-pterygoid contact (Chure, 2000; Brochu, 2003), so are recoded. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  is known to now as well (Mayr et al., 2007). The condition is <b>hesperornithines</b> 
  is uncertain (Elzanowski, 1991), since what was previously thought to be a vomer 
  are now thought to be palatines. The condition in <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is 
  also uncertain, as the vomer is posteriorly incomplete (Clarke, 2002).</p>
<p>40. Again, <b>theropods</b> (<i>Allosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i>) have vomer-premaxillary 
  contact (Madsen, 1976; Brochu, 2003), so are recoded. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> probably 
  lacks contact (Elzanowski, 2001), while the condition in <b>hesperornithines</b> 
  is again uncertain (Elzanowski, 1991). </p>
<p>41. The vomer probably contacts the maxilla in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Elzanowski 
  and Wellnhofer, 1996) and did so in <i>Gobipteryx</i> (Chiappe et al., 2001). 
  The condition in <b>hesperornithines</b> is again uncertain (Elzanowski, 1991). 
</p>
<p>42. The palatine probably does not contact the parasphenoid in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Mayr et al., 2007).</p>
<p>43. The palatine and pterygoid have a long contact in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Mayr et al., 2007).</p>
<p>44. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996) has basipterygoid 
  processes, while <i>Gobipteryx</i> (Chiappe et al., 2001) lacks them. <b>Neognathae</b> 
  should be polymorphic, as galloanserines have processes while most neoavians 
  lack them.</p>
<p>45. <b>Theropods</b> should be polymorphic, as <i>Gallimimus</i> has elongate 
  processes (Osmolska et al., 1972). <i>Archaeopteryx</i> is also now known to 
  have elongate processes (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996). The character is 
  of course correlated with 44, so <i>Gobipteryx</i> is still coded unknown.</p>
<p>47. <b>Theropods</b> and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 
  1996) have long ventral squamosal processes, homologous to birds' zygomatic 
  process. </p>
<p>49. This character (nasals do not meet broadly on midline) is connected with 
  character 48 (nasals do not extend far posterior to premaxillae) because the 
  latter generally happens in birds due to a posteriorly extending nasal process 
  of the premaxillae which blocks internasal contact. The exception is when the 
  mesethmoid is in the place of the posteriormost premaxilla, as in palaeognaths. 
  The nasals probably do not meet on the midline in <i>Gobipteryx</i>, considering 
  the long nasal processes of the premaxilla (Chiappe et al., 2001).</p>
<p>50. This character (mesethmoid broadly exposed on skull roof) is the natural 
  consequence of having character 49 but not 48. The one exception in Cracraft's 
  matrix is Tinamidae, which actually does have a broadly exposed mesethmoid (Silveira 
  and Hofling, 2007). Thus it is deleted and all ten coded taxa are recoded as 
  unknown.</p>
<p>51. This character (dorsal premaxillary process extends posteriorly to level 
  of lacrimal) is correlated directly to character 49, as a posteriorly extensive 
  premaxillary process will block the nasals from meeting on the midline. As it 
  is coded identically, it is deleted and all twelve coded taxa are recoded as 
  unknown.</p>
<p>53. <i>Hesperornis</i> lacks this character (alaparasphenoid wing inflated 
  by the anterior tympanic recess) (Witmer, 1990), as does <i>Ichthyornis</i> 
  (Clarke, 2004). While galliforms also have the inflation (Witmer, 1990), Neognathae 
  is here kept as primitively lacking it.</p>
<p>54. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> probably has a more ventrally placed articular 
  surface on its quadrate for the braincase (Elzanowski, 2002). Hesperornithines 
  (Witmer, 1990) and <i>Ichthyornis</i> (Clarke, 2004) have this character as 
  well.</p>
<p>55. <i>Hesperornis</i> lacks this character (highly pneumatic bone posterior 
  to quadrate articulation on braincase), while <i>Ichthyornis</i> seems to as 
  well (Clarke, 2004). While Witmer notes some neoavians (e.g. most gruiforms) 
  have the character), it is here left as basally absent in that clade. </p>
<p>56. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lacks this character (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996), 
  while <i>Ichthyornis</i> has it (Clarke, 2004). The condition in <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  is unknown, but the basal hesperornithine <i>Enaliornis</i> has these (Witmer, 
  1990). Hesperornithes is left coded unknown though, since <i>Enaliornis</i> 
  was not used by Cracraft to code the OTU. Livezey and Zusi (2007) code <b>casuaries</b> 
  and <b>emus</b> as lacking the character.</p>
<p>57. Taxa without ossified eustachian tubes (e.g. theropods) must be coded as 
  unknown for this character. The position in <i>Ichthyornis</i> seems to be lateral 
  (Clarke, 2004).</p>
<p>58. This character (eustachian tubes placed near median) is simply the opposite 
  state of character 57 (eustachian tubes placed laterally), so it is deleted 
  and the eight coded taxa are recoded unknown.</p>
<p>59. Paul (2002) and Tischlinger (2005) identified a well developed postorbital 
  in the Berlin <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> specimen. </p>
<p>61. Both <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> (Chiappe et al., 2001) and <b>Hesperornithes</b> 
  (Witmer, 1990) are now known to have prominent dorsal maxillary processes.</p>
<p>62. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> lacks this character (squamosal incorporated 
  into braincase) (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996).</p>
<p>63. <b>Theropods</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Gallimimus</i> has a weakly forked 
  posterior dentary (Hurum, 2001). Cracraft correctly states <i>Ichthyornis</i> 
  lacks a posteriorly forked dentary, though he (mistakenly?) codes it as unknown. 
</p>
<p>64. This character (strongly forked dentary) is correlated with character 63 
  (forked dentary), so any taxa coded 0 for 63 (e.g. Hesperornithes) should be 
  coded unknown for 64. <i>Gobipteryx</i> appears to have a strongly forked dentary 
  (Elzanowski, 1977). </p>
<p>65. A distinct posteriorly projecting ventral tuber on the humerus is present 
  in <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1969), so <b>theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic. 
  <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is unknown (Kurochkin, 1996), as proximal humeral material 
  is now referred to &quot;Gobipipus&quot;. <i>Ambiortus</i> has a small ventral 
  tuber (Kurochkin, 1999). Hesperornithines and ratites both have highly reduced 
  forelimbs, with Cracraft noting ratites have merely a blunt projection and codes 
  them as unknown due to this modification (except <i>Apteryx</i>, which is correctly 
  coded as lacking the tuber). Yet <i>Hesperornis</i>' and <i>Baptornis</i>' humeri 
  are just as modified, so should have also been coded as unknown instead of plesiomorphic. 
  Livezey and Zusi (2007) code all ratites as having both ventral tubers and capital 
  grooves. They are here left as unknown pending better data.</p>
<p>66. Again, <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is unknown for this character (pneumotricipital 
  fossa in humerus) (Kurochkin, 1996). <i>Ambiortus</i> lacks the fossa (Kurochkin, 
  1999). Cracraft states the fossa &quot;is not well developed&quot; in some ratites 
  and codes <i>Struthio</i> and <i>Rhea</i> as unknown, <i><b>Dromaius</b></i> 
  and <i><b>Casuarius</b></i> as derived, and <i>Apteryx</i> as primitive. Livezey 
  and Zusi (2007) code all ratites as lacking a fossa, so the four large ratites 
  are tentatively recoded as lacking the fossa.</p>
<p>67. This character (humeral head strongly defined) primarily involves the presence 
  of a capital groove. One is present in <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1969), so 
  <b>theropods</b> are coded as polymorphic. <i><b>Gobipteryx</b></i> is again 
  unknown (Kurochkin, 1996). <b><i>Ambiortus</i></b> lacks a capital groove (Kurochkin, 
  1999). </p>
<p>68. This is a composite character, involving a strongly projecting ventral 
  condyle, well defined entepicondyle and undercut distal condyles.</p>
<p>69. <i>Gobipteryx</i> has a ventrally placed scapular articulation on the coracoid 
  (Kurochkin, 1996).</p>
<p>70. <i>Gobipteryx</i> lacks a procoracoid process (Kurochkin, 1996), but <b>hesperornithines</b> 
  (<i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>) have it (Martin and Tate, 1976). Based 
  on Livezey and Zusi's (2007) coding, <i>Dromaius</i>, <i>Casuarius</i> and <i>Apteryx</i> 
  are coded as derived.</p>
<p>71. <i>Gobipteryx</i> lacks a brachial fossa on the humerus (Kurochkin, 1996). 
  <i>Struthio</i> and <i>Rhea</i> are here tentatively recoded as plesiomorphic, 
  after Livezey and Zusi (2007), though Cracraft notes ratites have somewhat ambiguous 
  morphology.</p>
<p>72. This character (less than twenty-five caudal vertebrae) is correlated with 
  characters 10 (less than twenty caudal vertebrae) and 11 (less than ten caudal 
  vertebrae), so all taxa scored 0 for it (theropods) should be scored as unknown 
  for character 10.</p>
<p>73. By &quot;rotated forelimb&quot;, I'm assuming Cracraft means the lateral 
  placement caused by the glenoid shift. <i>Gallimimus</i> (Osmolska et al., 1972) 
  and <i>Deinonychus</i> (Parsons and Parsons, 2009) also have this character, 
  so <b>theropods</b> should be polymorphic. Lecho enantiornithines (Chiappe and 
  Walker, 2002), <i>Gobipteryx</i> (Kurochkin, 1996), <i>Alexornis</i> (Brodkorb, 
  1976) and <i>Ambiortus</i> (Kurochkin, 1999) also have this character.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- Cracraft's analysis has several problems. 
  It has a large number (14 of 73) of correlated characters, which serve to overemphasize 
  tail length, premaxillary-nasal morphology and other features. A few times Cracraft 
  codes a taxon unknown because he believes its condition is secondarily derived, 
  but this must be tested by analysis, not assumed a priori. The all-zero theropod 
  outgroup is somewhat problematic, as at least some of his exemplar taxa should 
  be coded as having the apomorphic state 15 of 73 times. Several characters (8, 
  38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 58) are uninformative, as they are only present in one OTU, 
  so artificially inflate the Consistancy Index (.75 without them compared to 
  .80 with them) and add nothing to the analysis. Cracraft was limited by the 
  material available in 1986, which is mostly apparent in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  and <i>Gobipteryx</i>. In addition, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Ambiortus</i> 
  have been redescribed in detail. Cracraft's analysis is superior to most in 
  commenting at least a bit on each character, and in including fragmentary taxa 
  and explicitly describing the alternative placements for each. In total, 176/1095 
  (16%) of the codings are inaccurate. This is only half as much as in Gauthier's 
  analysis published earlier that year, in large part due to the fact Cracraft 
  examined many specimens firsthand. When recoded, the following cladogram results-</p>

<p>Within this tree, <i>Alexornis</i> is a carinate outside of Ratites. The tree 
  is mostly unusual in placing Enantiornithes sister to Aves instead of basal 
  to Hesperornithes.</p>
<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Cracraft's original matrix, and 
  his recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is already most 
  parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it. 91</p>

<p>As the first numerical cladistic analysis of Mesozoic birds, Cracraft's paper 
  provides the first objective support for several groups. Sauriurae is very strongly 
  rejected by his original data, and almost as strongly rejected by the recoded 
  data. While both the original and recoded trees support an odd placement for 
  enantiornithines (and especially <i>Gobipteryx</i>) as within Carinatae, the 
  moderate support drops to weak support with recoding. Enantiornithine monophyly 
  is basically ambiguously rejected in the original matrix, and very weakly supported 
  in the recoded data. The old idea that <i>Hesperornis</i> a a loon (neognath) 
  is strongly rejected by the original data, and moderately rejected by the new 
  data. The similarly old idea <i>Ichthyornis</i> is a neognath is only weakly 
  rejected by both datasets though. The uncommon arrangement with <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  closer to Aves than <i>Ichthyornis</i> is moderately rejected by the original 
  data, but only weakly rejected by the recoded data. Any placement of <i>Ambiortus</i> 
  within non-ratite Carinatae is poorly supported, and even a placement outside 
  Carinatae is only weakly rejected. Finally, the new molecular arrangement of 
  palaeognaths by Harshman et al. is weakly rejected by both matrices.</p>
<p><b>Experiments with controversial taxa</b>- The odd placement of enantiornithines 
  could be tested by including a complete specimen, such as <i>Sinornis</i>. The 
  very basal placement of Hesperornithes is probably due to its reduced forelimbs, 
  which might be tested by including <i>Confuciusornis</i> as a far more basal 
  flying taxon. In Cracraft's discussion, he mentions <i>Gansus</i> as &quot;critical 
  for assessing the chronology of avian evolution&quot;, making its inclusion 
  interesting especially given the numerous recently discovered specimens of the 
  genus. Finally, Cracraft's theropod outgroup could be split into each of its 
  four genera. Cracraft's matrix will be tested by deleting 'theropods', and adding 
  <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i>, <i>Deinonychus</i>, 
  <i>Confuciusornis</i>, <i>Sinornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>. The resulting cladogram 
  is-</p>

<p><i>Alexornis</i> was at least as derived as Hesperornithes, but excluded from 
  ratites. 119 </p>
<p>Separating the outgroup taxa resulted in a standard theropod topology. The 
  <i>Sinornis</i> codings did indeed move Enantiornithes and <i>Gobipteryx</i> 
  basal to Hesperornithes as predicted (as confirmed if <i>Confuciusornis</i> 
  isn't analyzed). However, <i>Gobipteryx</i> and <i>Alexornis</i> are more closely 
  related to Hesperornithes+Carinatae, unlike current theories. To force a monophyletic 
  Enantiornithes is only two steps longer, and <i>Confuciusornis</i> regains its 
  normal position sister to Enantiornithes+Euornithes (Ornithothoraces). Additionally, 
  it only takes one step to place <i>Confuciusornis</i> basal to Ornithothoraces 
  while ignoring relationships within the latter clade. Forcing a Sauriurae including 
  <i>Confuciusornis</i> is now only 14 extra steps (so still strongly rejected, 
  but slightly less so), while including <i>Confuciusornis</i> within Enantiornithes 
  is only weakly rejected with 3 extra steps. <i>Gansus</i> emerged close to <i>Ichthyornis</i>, 
  matching recent analyses. Moving it within Aves (as either a neognath or a palaeognath) 
  is weakly rejected by two more steps.</p>
