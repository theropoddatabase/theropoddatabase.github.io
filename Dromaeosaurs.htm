<b>Comments</b>- Bonaparte erected Unenlagidae (also spelled
Unenlagiidae in a table) for <i>Unenlagia</i> and "the Malgache
genus", with the latter referenced to <i>Vorona</i>'s description.
Malgache is French for Malagasy, so perhaps Bonaparte really was
referring <i>Vorona</i> to Unenlagiidae. However, as he states
similarities in the scapulae, pubes and ischia are similar (all
elements unpreserved in <i>Vorona</i>), it seems more probable he
meant to cite <i>Rahonavis</i>.
In any case, as he does not include a definition or diagnosis, the
family is a nomen nudum (ICZN Article 13.1.1). <br>

Agnolin and Novas (2011)
were the first authors to use Unenlagiidae with a diagnosis, properly
erecting the family based on Makovicky et al.'s (2005)
Unenlagiinae.  They defined the family in 2013 as "the node
including <span style="font-style: italic;">Unenlagia</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Buitreraptor</span>, its most common
ancestor plus all of its descendants", but this excludes <span style="font-style: italic;">Austroraptor</span> and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Rahonavis</span> in many topologies, so
Hartman et al. (2019) changed it to a stem-based definition.  The
latter purposefully left out <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Halszkaraptor</span>
to allow the family Unenlagiidae to potentially include Microraptorinae
and Halszkaraptorinae in addition to Unenlagiinae.  <br>

Brum et al. (2021 online) recently proposed Unenlagiinia to include
unenlagiines and halszkaraptorines but not microraptorians or
eudromaeosaurs, but this leaves them without a family if they are not
dromaeosaurids as in Agnolin and Novas' and Hartman et al.'s topologies.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Ji et al. state the holotype, discovered prior to April 2012, was
offered for study by a private individual. The locality was listed as
"Lamadong, Jianchang County, Liaoning Province; Yixian Formation", but
Li et al. (2014) state "recent fieldwork confirmed the outcrops of
fossil beds exposed in Lamadong Village mainly belong to the Jiufotang
Formation (X. L. Wang, personal commun.)."  The description is
brief and the illustration and photo quality poor, so that not much
information is determinable. While the authors believe it is an
oviraptorosaur more basal than <i>Caudipteryx</i> or <i>Incisivosaurus</i>,
the low iliofemoral ratio, low ischiopubic ratio and enlarged pedal
ungual ?II suggest possible paravian relations.  Funston and
Currie (2016) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Ningyuansaurus</span>
to Osmolska et al.'s oviraptorosaur matrix lineage and recovered it in
a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Luoyanggia</span>, but other than
oviraptorosaurs only include <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>,

extensor view; distal end of metatarsal IV diverges laterodistally.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Osmolska
(1982) originally diagnosed <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>
based on symplesiomorphies for Neotheropoda (functionally tridactyl
pes;
metatarsals II-IV subequally thick), Tyrannoraptora (metatarsus slender
[width: length ratio 0.16]), Deinonychosauria (second pedal digit
specialized), and Halszkarptorinae (metatarsal III not wedged in
anterior view).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in Summer 1970
(Kielan-Jaworowska and Barsbold, 1972) and described twelve years
later. Using <span style="font-style: italic;">Halszkaraptor</span> as
a guide, we can estimate <i>Hulsanpes</i> was about 560 mm long, but
it was juvenile based on the rough bone texture and the badly abraded
articular joints.<br>
Osmolska allied this species with dromaeosaurids based on the
ginglymoid second and third metatarsals and subequally developed
metatarsals II and IV, but noted it resembled troodontids in the narrow
metatarsus and weakly developed second pedal digit. She dismissed avian
origins based on the lack of fusion.  Chiappe and Norell (Norell
pers. comm. to Currie, 2001) think <i>Hulsanpes</i> is not a
dromaeosaurid, but from "another more speciose branch of the
Maniraptora".  Senter et al. (2004) was the first published
analysis to include <i>Hulsanpes</i>, which emerged as a dromaeosaurid
because they misscored the ginglymoid metatarsal II as absent in <i>Sinovenator</i>. 
Cau et al. (2017) described the more complete taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Halszkaraptor</span> and created
Halszkaraptorinae for these and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mahakala</span>
finding them sister to unenlagiids plus dromaeosaurids using his
Megamatrix.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2007) proximal caudal vertebrae
with subhorizontal, laterally directed prezygapophyses (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>); strongly compressed and
anteroposteriorly broad ulna tapering posteriorly to a narrow edge;
elongate lateral crest on the posterodistal part of the femur.<br>
(after Turner et al., 2011) ledgelike depression at the confluence of
metotic strut and posterior tympanic recess on the anterior face of the
paroccipital process; posteriorly tapering scapula; short forelimb
(humerus 50% femur length); prominent supratrochanteric process;
absence of a cuppedicus fossa (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>).<br>
(after Cau et al., 2017) pendant paroccipital processes (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>); short forelimb (humerus
not longer than 50% of femur; (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>); distal ends of

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1992 and first noted by Turner et al.
(2006). <br>
This is generally recovered as sister to unenlagiids plus
dromaeosaurids using the TwiG matrix (as in Turner et al. 2007 and
2011), although Senter et
al. (2012) recovered it as a microraptorian.  Cau et al. (2017)
described  the more complete <span style="font-style: italic;">Halszkaraptor</span>
and created Halszkaraptorinae for these and <span style="font-style: italic;">Hulsanpes</span>, finding them sister to
unenlagiids plus dromaeosaurids using his Megamatrix and Brusatte's
TWiG analysis.  <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- In 2021 the Serra da
Galga and Ponte Alta Members of the Mar&iacute;lia Formation were recognized
as the Serra da Galga Formation.  Collected
in the 1950s and only surviving as an unfinished plate drawn by Price
labeled 'Lopasaurus', this is presumably the "metatarsals (all in the
DNPM, Rio de Jineiro) which Price believed included at least two new
genera and families."  Brum et al. (2021 online) stated it
disappeared after Price's death and first published the figure and
name, identifying it as an unenlagiine based on "the anterior surface
of metatarsal III transversally expanded; the expansion of the
posterolateral region of metatarsal II; and the expansion of the
posteromedial region of metatarsal IV. In posterior view, the
expansions observed in metatarsals II and IV overlap metatarsal
III."  While this could belong to the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Ypupiara</span>,
Brum et al. note it was not associated with the type skull fragments,
and multiple unenlagiines may have coexisted as in the Portezuelo
Formation.  "Lopasaurus" is a nomen nudum, as it was not used as
valid when
proposed (ICZN Article 11.5), "accompanied by a description or
definition that states in words characters that are purported to
differentiate the taxon" (Article 13.1.1), or "accompanied by the
fixation of a type species in the original publication" (Article 13.3).<br>

centra (32-82 mm), incomplete humerus, radii (161 mm), ulnae (one
incomplete, one partial; 188 mm), metacarpals I (39 mm), phalanx I-1

process of postorbital extremely reduced; maxillary and dentary teeth
fluted; humerus short, representing slightly less than 50 per cent of

the extremely robust phalanx IV-2.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Novas et al. (2009) also included the small
tooth size and lack of serrations as apomorphies, but these are
probably basal for paravians.<br>

in the 1950s, Holgado et al. (2018) announced this in an abstract as a
new taxon of unenlagiine.  Brum et al. state "After the great fire
that destroyed the main building of the MN-UFRJ in September 2018 ...
the specimen was not recovered and is here considered as lost." 
They added <span style="font-style: italic;">Ypupiara</span> to Cau's
matrix and recovered it as an unenlagiine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Austroraptor</span>, which is also the
result when added to the Hartman et al. matrix.  <br>

humerus (~90 mm), radius (~80-82 mm), ulna (82 mm), scapholunare,
pisiform,

mm), phalanx I-1 (28.5 mm), manual ungual I (16 mm), metacarpal II

III-2 (5.9 mm), phalanx III-3 (17.9 mm), manual ungual III (11 mm),
manual claw sheaths <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut et al., 2019) humerus with large
deltopectoral crest, with a maximal expansion that exceeds the width of
the humeral shaft; proximal part of humerus strongly angled at
approximately 38 degrees with respect to distal shaft; ulna with
well-defined, single, oval, concave proximal cotyle and small lateral
tubercle; distal end of ulna slightly asymmetrically expanded; large,
crest-like biceps tubercle on proximal radius; longitudinal groove
along medial side of radial shaft; metacarpal II considerably more
robust than metacarpals I and III; manual phalanx I-1 with longitudinal
groove; manual phalanx II-1 very robust, but with rounded, rather than
flattened cross-section; manual phalanx II-1 slightly twisted; manual
unguals with strongly developed and palmarly transversely expanded
flexor tubercles.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was discovered
in 2017 and initially thought to be a new <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> specimen.  Paul
(2024) used the informal term alcmonavians for <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcmonavis</span>,
seemingly entirely based on the "flattened" manual phalanx II-1 being
developed early, admitting an uncertain placement within
Eumaniraptora.  This character is polymorphic for archaeopterygids
and dromaeosaurids, but in any case the term remains informal as an
'Alcmonavia' has never been published.<br>
Rauhut et al. (2019) added it to Foth et al.'s TWiG analysis and
recovered it as an avialan more derived than archaeopterygids but
outside <span style="font-style: italic;">Shemzhouraptor</span>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Sapeornis</span>+Pygostylia. 
When added to Hartman et al.'s TWiG analysis, it emerges as an
unenlagiine, which can be avialans with the addition of a single step
(albeit further from Aves than archaeopterygids).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2012) skull long, exceeding
femoral length by 25%; large maxillary fenestra; continuous transition
from frontal margin to postorbital process; quadrate with large lateral
flange and pneumatic foramen; dentary bears a deep subalveolar groove;
teeth small, unserrated, without root-crown constriction; posterior
cervical centra with ventrolateral ridge; furcula pneumatic; flexor
process present on humerus; brevis shelf expanded and lobate, projects
laterally from posterior end of ilium.<br>
(after Novas et al., 2017) dorsal vertebrae lacking pleurocoels; mid
and distal caudals with lateral complex of ridges (transverse process
with ridge that extends as feebly developed rims that reachs the
prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses; anterior half of centrum with
small ridge running towards the transverse process and a similar ridge
is located at the posterior end of the centrum; sub-triangular fossa on

scapular blade axially expanded at mid-length; extremely slender manual
elements; manus longer than femur (117% of femoral length); penultimate
pedal and manual phalanges with dorsally displaced collateral ligament
pits that are medially displaced and nearly contact each other.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Briefly described by Makovicky et al. (2005) and
Gianechini and Apesteguia (2011), Gianechini is studying this taxon for
his thesis. While Novas et al. (2017) identified the most complete
dorsaal vertebra as the seventh "based on comparisons with [the]
holotype specimen", but given the two posteriormost dorsals (12 and 13)
articulated with the sacrum and the five articulated posterior dorsals,
it must be at least as anterior as the sixth. <br>
Makovicky et al. found <i>Buitreraptor</i> to be an unenlagiine using
the TWiG matrix, which has been recovered in all subsequent analyses as
well. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- This was discovered in 2005 and initially referred to <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
by Porfiri et al. (2007), with the differences considered ontogenetic.
Porfiri et al. (2011) later described it as a new taxon of
dromaeosaurid, though they noted troodontid similarities and did not
run a phylogenetic analysis. Novas et al. (2013) questioned the
unenlagiine identification, stating the elongate metatarsus, "distally
extended metatarsal IV, subequal in distal extension to metatarsal
III", non-ginglymoid metatarsals II and IV, and more elongate and acute
pedal ungual were more similar to birds. They regarded it as Paraves
incertae sedis.<br>

but did not indicate the family was new (e.g. on page 142 it lacks the

(ICZN Article 16.1).  Livezey and Zusi (2007) erected
Rahonaviformes and Rahonavidae containing only <i>Rahonavis</i>
itself. As these were only used in a table that lacked a diagnosis or
definition, "Rahonavidae" was still a nomen nudum (ICZN Article 13.1.1).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2012) neural canal at least 40%
of the height of the dorsal vertebral centra; six sacral vertebrae;
deeply concave glenoid fossa on scapula; elongate acromion process
(length greater than length of glenoid); long muscle scar above glenoid
on lateral face of scapula; proximally kinked scapular shaft; elongate
ulna with ulnar papillae; ulnar distal condyle subtriangular in distal

femur; mediolaterally broad cnemial crest with short lateral process;
proximal end of tibia of equal width and length; greatly reduced fibula
lacking contact with the calcaneum; lack of a medial fossa on the
fibula.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The genus <i>Rahona</i> is preoccupied by limantriid
moths (Griveaud, 1975), so Forster et al. (1998b) renamed their genus <i>Rahonavis</i>.
All elements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Rahonavis</span>
were found in 1995.  The distal humeri were both found near to the
holotype and articulate perfectly with the type ulna, so may belong to
the same individual (O'Connor and Forster, 2010). O'Connor and Forster
call them Humeral Taxon B.  However, a second right ulna was also
found in the same layer, so another individual of the same size was
present who the humeri could also belong to.<br>
Originally recovered as an avialan by Forster et al (1998a) and the
TWiG matrix (Norell et al., 2001), Makovicky et al. (2005) and several
other iterations of the TWiG matrix instead place it as a basal
dromaeosaurid in Unenlagiinae. This was also recovered by Foth et al.
(2014), and the most recent versions of the TWiG matrix using Turner's
paravian updates (Brusatte et al., 2014). Agnolin and Novas (2011)
recover a compromise phylogeny where unenlagiines include <i>Rahonavis</i>
and are placed as basal avialans, while Xu et al. (2008) and Lee et al.
(2014) again found it to be an avialan, apart from deinonychosaurian
unenlagiines.<br>

long); teeth have 15-20 denticles/5 mm on distal carina and 20-27
denticles/5 mm on mesial carina; lateral and medial condyles of

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2005. Arbour et al.
(2015) reidentified the three supposed furcula (one in the holotype,
KUVP 152429 and NCSM 13170) as entoplastra of the trionychid turtle cf.
<i>Axestemys splendida</i>.<br>
DePalma et al. (2015) found it to be a dromaeosaurine sister to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
using a version of the TWiG analysis. However, Cau (online, 2015)
recovered it as sister to Velociraptorinae+Dromaeosaurinae in his
larger unpublished analysis, and my own unpublished analysis agrees it
is outside that clade.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Jasinski et
al., 2020) short and robust neural spine
on proximal caudal vertebrae; sharp angle of distal deltopectoral crest
of humerus (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dakotaraptor</span>);
vertical offset of side grooves on manual ungual II; dorsodistally
oriented groove just distal to articular surface on medial side of
manual ungual II; tall and distally wide flexor tubercle on manual
ungual II.<br>
(suggested) accessory ventral side grooves on manual ungual III.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Jasinski et
al. describe the first caudal as opisthocoelous but state
"the anterior surface is flat, the posterior is concave", making it
platycoelous as is common in dromaeosaurids (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>).  They list
"proximal caudal vertebrae
with curved ventral surface", but this is equally true of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>, IGM 100/22 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yurgovuchia</span>. 
Similarly, 'proximal caudal vertebrae
with oval to subrectangular anterior and
posterior centrum surfaces' describes all dromaeosaurids.  The
proximal
caudal transverse processes are "gracile and subrectangular" in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span> and IGM 100/22 as well,
but are actually broken distally in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dineobellator</span>
(Jasinski et al., 2011- fig. 10C-D) so that their shape is
indeterminate.  'Distinct round concavities on anterior
and posterior centrum surfaces in mid caudal vertebrae' are on rarely
exposed surfaces in dromaeosaurid tails, but a similar structure is
present at least posteriorly in <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
and anteriorly in <span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span>. 
The supposed enlarged flexor tubercle on pedal ungual III is actually
manual ungual III, and not larger than in other dromaeosaurids. 
This
also affects their character of a secondary side groove on pedal ungual
III, which is instead found in manual ungual III.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 2008,
Jasinski et al.
(2011) briefly describe SMP VP-2430 as Dromaeosauridae indet., noting
it "probably represents a new taxon and will be described in detail
elsewhere."  The dorsal vertebra they note and figure seems to be
the
centrum of the first caudal vertebra.  Jasinoski et al. (2015)
mention
it as "a specimen with both cranial and postcranial material [that] is
known from the Maastrichtian of New Mexico, probably representing a
distinct taxon, and is by far the most complete dromaeosaurid material
recovered from Late Cretaceous strata in southern Laramidia."Jasinski
(2018) described the specimen in his thesis as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dineobellator notohesperis</span>,
which is a nomen nudum as theses are generally considered not "issued
for the purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific record"
(ICZN Areticle 8.1.1).  He used Longrich and Currie's
dromaeosaurid
analysis to recover it as a eudromaeosaur closer to dromaeosaurines and
velociraptorines than to saurornitholestiines.  The taxon was
officially named and described by Jasinski et al. (2020) who used the
same analysis to recover it as a velociraptorine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span> sensu lato.  Adding it
to the Hartman et al. maniraptoromorph analysis results in it being an
unenlagiid close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dakotaraptor</span>
with 2 steps and 3 steps needed respectively to move it to the
positions of Jasinski's thesis and eventual description.<br>
The left lacrimal fragment is supp. fig. 2A would seem to be in medial
view based on comparison with <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>,
making the labeled
lacrimal recess either autapomorphic or taphonomic.  Jasinoski et
al.
describe an articulated string of four vertebrae as fused distal
caudals, but they are about half as long as tall (43-54%) unlike
theropod distal caudals which are always much longer than tall. 
For a
comparison, their centra are 75% as tall as the anterior face of the
first caudal vertebra but 16-19% of its length, whereas in <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
the caudal 75% as tall as the first (~caudal 15) is 143% its
length. 
Instead, these small (4.12, 5.10 mm) and tall centra resemble
actinopterygians, in both size and the presence of foramina and
anteroposterior ridges which the authors attributed to prezygapophyseal
rods.  Multiple fish are present in the Alamo Wash local fauna
including lepisosteids, although amiid and esocid vertebrae are also
common in similar formations.  The supposed pedal ungual III is
not
only far more curved than non-avialan pedal unguals (except
deinonychosaur pedal unguals II), its dorsal margin arches far dorsal
to the articular surface, which Senter described as distinguishing
dromaeosaurid manual unguals from pedal unguals.  Its articular
surface
is much smaller (59% as tall, 49% as wide) than the other ungual,
suggesting it is from manual digit III. <br>

Portezuelo Formation of the Rio Neuquen Subgroup, Neuquen, Argentina</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (MCF PVPH 77) (~2 m) fragmentary cervical vertebra,
dorsal ribs, chevrons, proximal radius, incomplete femur (~250 mm),
distal tibia, distal fibula, incomplete astragalus, calcaneum,
metatarsal I (30.4 mm), phalanx I-1 (27 mm), pedal ungual I (26.9 mm
straight), incomplete metatarsal II (~147.9 mm), phalanx II-1 (39.1
mm), phalanx II-2 (36.2 mm), pedal ungual II (39.7 mm), incomplete
metatarsal III (~172.7 mm), phalanx III-1 (57.4 mm), phalanx III-2
(36.6 mm), phalanx III-3 (34.4 mm), incomplete metatarsal IV (~149.6
mm), phalanx IV-2 (32.3 mm), phalanx IV-3 (25.4 mm), phalanx IV-4 (25.5
mm), pedal ungual IV (21.7 mm)<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- All of the characters listed in Novas and Pol's
(2005) diagnosis are actually more widely distributed. A
subarctometatarsus is present in most basal paravians. Metatarsal II
laterally expands over metatarsal III posteriorly in <i>Buitreraptor</i>
and <i>Pamparaptor</i>. An extensor sulcus on metatarsal III is also
present in <i>Buitreraptor</i>, troodontids and microraptorians.
Metatarsal III is also incipiently ginglymoid in <i>Buitreraptor</i>, <i>Microraptor</i>
and several other paravians. Subequal pedal phalanges II-1 and II-2 are
also present in several paravians including <i>Adasaurus</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
<i>Microraptor</i>, NGMC 91, <i>Bambiraptor</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>.
A strongly curved pedal ungual II is found in most dromaeosaurids and
basal avialans. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was discovered in 1996 and originally reported as
a troodontid until its official description identified it as a
dromaeosaurid. Novas (pers. comm., 2005) confirms that it is the same
specimen as "Araucanoraptor". Gianechini and Apesteguia (2011)
illustrate the proximal ungual originally placed as ungual I by Novas
and Pol (2005) as ungual IV. The distal ungual originally placed as IV
may be I or III, but is not illustrated by Gianechini and Apesteguia.
Makovicky et al. (2005) suggested that <i>Neuquenraptor</i> and <i>Unenlagia</i>
may be synonymous based on supposedly identical femur (<i>U. comahuensis</i>),
pedal phalanx II-1 and pedal ungual II (<i>U. paynemili</i>). See the
comments under <i>Unenlagia</i> for details, but <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
seems distinct from <i>U. comahuensis</i>, but cannot be compared to <i>U.
paynemili</i>, except for the possibly referrable phalanx II-1, which
differ between taxa. Though usually referred to Unenlagiinae, without
the addition of information from <i>Unenlagia</i>, <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
can be placed in any of several basal paravian positions outside
derived dromaeosaurids, derived troodontids and derived avialans.<br>
Porfiri et al. (2007) reported another specimen of <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
(MUCPv-1163), but this has since been made the holotype of <i>Pamparaptor</i>
by Porfiri et al. (2011). <br>

<b><i>Unenlagia</i></b> Novas and Puerta, 1997<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- deep lateral fossae at base of posterior dorsal
neural spines; marked inflection of posterodorsal ilial edge at level
of supratrochanteric process; posteriorly curved distal pubis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The posteriorly curved distal pubis cited as an
apomorphy by Calvo et al. (2004) is a basal paravian trait also seen in
microraptorians, <i>Bambiraptor</i>, <i>Buitreraptor</i>, <i>Rahonavis</i>,
<i>Confuciusornis</i> and other taxa. Calvo et al. also cited the
marked inflection of posterodorsal ilial edge at level of
supratrochanteric process, but this is due to the tall ilium and
prominant supratrochanteric process, which are plesiomorphic and
apomorphic respectively. <i>Buitreraptor</i> approaches the condition,
while <i>Achillobator</i> has it. The dorsal neural spine fossae
aren't known in related taxa, but are only present in some vertebrae of
<i>Unenlagia comahuensis</i> and may be easily missed. Thus, the
referral of <i>U? paynemili</i> to <i>Unenlagia</i> is provisional
and may turn out to be incorrect.<br>

Makovicky et al. (2005) suggested that <i>Neuquenraptor</i> and <i>Unenlagia</i>
may be synonymous based on supposedly identical femur (<i>U. comahuensis</i>),
pedal phalanx II-1 and pedal ungual II (<i>U? paynemili</i>). However, <i>Neuquenraptor</i>'s
femur is more robust in anterior view than can be accounted for by
distal incompleteness (unpublished photos; Novas and Pol, 2005; contra
Makovicky et al.), given the position of curvature in lateral view. <i>Neuquenraptor</i>'s
pedal phalanx II-1 differs from the one tentatively referred to <i>U?
paynemili</i> in some minor ways- ligament tubercle more dorsally
placed; taller compared to length. <i>Unenlagia? paynemili</i>'s
preserved ungual appears to be a manual ungual, and is thus not
comparable to <i>Neuquenraptor</i>'s preserved unguals. Furthermore,
the ungual and phalanx were only tentatively referred to <i>Unenlagia</i>,
being found respectively 5 and 12.5 meters away from the holotype of <i>U?
paynemili</i>. The tibiae of <i>U. comahuensis</i> and <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
differ in that <i>Neuquenraptor</i>'s has a shorter medially
projecting portion just proximal to the tarsus. <i>Neuquenraptor</i>
seems distinct from <i>U. comahuensis</i>, but cannot be compared to <i>U?
paynemili</i>, except for the possibly referrable phalanx II-1, which
differ between taxa. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- The phylogenetic placement of <i>Unenlagia</i> is
controversial. Originally described as an avialan (Novas and Puerta,
1997), this was coorborated by Novas and Pol (2002) and Novas (2004).
Forster et al. (1998) suggested it was an archaeopterygid, while Holtz
(2000) found it equally supported as an avialan sister taxon to <i>Rahonavis</i>,
sister to <i>Archaeopteryx </i>+ Metornithes or sister to
ornithothoracines. Norell and Makovicky (1999) noted several traits
similar to dromaeosaurids and not as birdlike as originally suggested,
which is reflected in the results of the Theropod Working Group (Norell
et al., 2001 and modifications) placing it inside Eudromaeosauria until
the publication of <i>Buitreraptor</i> (Makovicky et al., 2005). This
latter paper interprets <i>Unenlagia</i> as a basal dromaeosaurid in a
clade with <i>Rahonavis</i> and <i>Buitreraptor</i>, termed the
Unenlagiinae. However, examination of their matrix revealed numerous
coding errors. <br>

It's placed by <i>Rahonavis</i> and <i>Buitreraptor</i> by Makovicky
et al. due to four characters. The supracetabular crest is also present
in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, mesopuby seems primitive for coelurosaurs, an
acute obturator process is present in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and
microraptorians, and a dorsally concave postacetabular process is
extremely widespread in coelurosaurs. <i>Unenlagia</i> is sister to <i>Rahonavis</i>
in Makovicky et al.'s tree based on five characters. Pleurocoelous
posterior dorsal centra are present in some eudromaeosaurs and
avialans, six sacrals are present in derived members of most
maniraptoriform clades, a posteriorly extensive cuppedicus fossa is
present in most paravians, an elongate preacetabular process is present
in <i>Scansoriopteryx</i> and avialans, and a large proximodorsal
ischial process is found in avialans.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Makovicky et al. (2005) are probably correct about <i>Unenlagia?
paynemili's</i> preserved phalanx being II-1 instead of I-1 (as
identified by Calvo et al., 2004). The preserved ungual appears to be
neither pedal I (contra Calvo et al.) nor II (contra Makovicky et al.),
but instead a manual ungual (Porfiri and Calvo, 2007). This is due to
the enlarged flexor tubercle and dorsal margin which arches high over
the proximal surface, characters used by Senter et al. (2004) to
identify <i>Achillobator</i>'s ungual (which <i>U. paynemili</i>'s
strongly resembles) as manual. Note Porfiri et al. (2011) photographed
and discussed a pedal phalanx II-2 of <i>paynemili</i>, though the
reason for the referral was never indicated. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Sereno's new (in press) definition modifies his
earlier (1998) one by using the eponymous genus as an internal
specifier, and adding <i>Ornithomimus</i> and <i>Passer</i> as
external specifiers. This contrasts with the two published node-based
definitions- (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> <i>albertensis</i> + <i>Velociraptor</i>
<i>mongoliensis</i>) by Padian et al. (1999) and (<i>Microraptor</i> <i>zhaoianus</i>
+ <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> <i>millenii</i> + <i>Velociraptor</i> <i>mongoliensis</i>)
by Norell et al. (2004). Norell et al.'s is problematic for not
including <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, and for explicitly including <i>Microraptor</i>.
The latter would make pygostylians dromaeosaurids in Mayr et al.'s
(2005) and Agnolin and Novas' (2013) topology. Padian et al.'s is
equivalent to the use of Dromaeosauridae prior to 1999, but
microraptorians weren't known and 'unenlagiines' were considered
avialans. Once microraptorians were discovered, they were assigned to
Dromaeosauridae by most authors except Senter et al. (2004). So using a
definition which won't probably exclude them does have some precedence,
but Sereno's should have more external specifiers if it is adopted,
namely <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Paul, 1988; 2002), <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
(Matthew and Brown, 1922; Russell and Dong, 1994), <i>Ornitholestes</i>
(Makovicky, 1995) and <i>Oviraptor</i> (Barsbold et al., 1990). I
actually think this stem-based definition is better than Padian et
al.'s node-based one for the additional reason that exactly which taxa
fall into the (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> + <i>Velociraptor</i>) crown is
uncertain. With the recognition that velociraptorine sensu lato
characters are symplesiomorphic for dromaeosaurs (e.g. found in <i>Bambiraptor</i>
and microraptorians), taxa like <i>Deinonychus</i> or <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
could easily fall just outside the defined node, not to mention more
fragmentary taxa such as <i>Variraptor</i> or <i>Pyroraptor</i>. So I
advocate the following redefinition of Sereno's- (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> <i>albertensis</i>
&lt;- <i>Tyrannosaurus rex, Ornithomimus velox, Oviraptor
philoceratops, Troodon formosus, Archaeopteryx lithographica, Passer
domesticus</i>).<br>
Kurzanov (1976) erected Itemiridae for <i>Itemirus</i> only, sister to
tyrannosaurids than to dromaeosaurids. Martynuik (2012) defined
Itemiridae as excluding <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, but since the ICZN
states families cannot contain other families, Itemiridae is listed as
a synonym of Dromaeosauridae here.<br>
Miller (2004) stated "I would ascribe <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor
gui</span>, and possibly <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptovolans</span>,
to its own family, the Tetrapteryxidae", but <span style="font-style: italic;">Tetrapteryx</span>
is a gruid genus whose name cannot be used for a family of
dromaeosaurs, so Miller's taxon is invalid.  Miller also proposed
Avenychia for "The most inclusive dromaeosaurid clade, including the
Tetrapteryxidae* plus all later dromaeosaurid genera", which would make
it a junior synonym of Dromaeosauridae here.  Similarly, Miller
proposes Enantiavenychia for the clade including <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span> and eudromaeosaurs but
not "tetrapteryxids", which is not recognized here as <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptovolans</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">gui</span> are synonymized with <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor zhaoianus</span>.  <br>
<b>Not dromaeosaurids</b>- Teeth from the Albian Eumeralla Formation
and Aptian Wonthoggi Formation of Victoria, Australia have been
commonly referred to Dromaeosauridae (Rich and Vickers-Rich, 1994), but
are retained as Coelurosauria incertae sedis here as the lack of mesial
serrations is known in many other coelurosaurs (e.g. <i>Orkoraptor</i>,
compsognathids, most troodontids). <br>
A partial braincase referred to as possibly dromaeosaurid (CCMGE
466/12457) by Nessov (1995) was referred to <i>Urbacodon sp.</i> by
Averianov and Sues (2007). <br>
A partial pedal phalanx II-2 (IGM-7715) was tentatively referred to
Dromaeosauridae by Rodriguez de la Rosa and Cevallos-Ferriz (1998)
based on the dorsally placed collateral ligament pit. However, this
character is also present in basal troodontids (e.g. IGM 100/44, <i>Sinornithoides</i>,
<i>Borogovia</i>), <i>Neuquenraptor</i> and <i>Rahonavis</i>. It is
here referred to Paraves incertae sedis.<br>
Tavares et al. (2014) described two teeth from the Adamantina Formation
of Brazil as dromaeosaurid, but these are here considered more likely
to be abelisaurid.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?...(ROM 63778) incomplete left dentary (Evans, Larson

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Evans et al., 2013) relatively small anterior

<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was found on August 28, 2009, while the referred dentary
was collected several years later.  Evans et al. stated "The
referred dentary, ROM 63778, was found approximately 4 m from the
holotype maxilla in the same sandstone-hosted bonebed" and "The
corresponding size and close physical association of the holotype
maxilla and the dentary in the same bonebed suggest that they may
belong to the same individual animal."  Note while they claim
"Morphometric analyses ... of tooth measurements from the specimen
(Tables S1 and S2) indicate that the teeth are similar to previously
collected isolated dromaeosaur teeth from the Hell Creek and Lance
formations and that they are more similar to these teeth than any other
North American dromaeosaur", Figure S4 actually shows some <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> fall out just as

<b>Late Campanian, Late Cretaceous<br>

Holotype</b>- (RTMP 89.55.47) incomplete frontal (52.4 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Bell and Currie, 2015) supratemporal ridge on
frontals forming acute angle (55 degrees) anteriorly. <br>
Combination of- frontal elongate and slender; low supratemporal ridge
forming arc that is concave relative to interfrontal suture in dorsal
view; area immediately posterior to supratemporal ridge smooth and
posteroventrally sloping.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Ryan and Russell (2001) listed the holotype frontal as
"<i>Saurornitholestes</i> undescribed n. sp. (Currie pers. comm.)".
Bell and Currie (2015) described this and other material (distal caudal
RTMP 88.55.129, manual ungual UALVP 53597, and pedal ungual II RTMP
86.55.184) from the Pipestone Creek <i>Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai</i>
bonebed as <i>Boreonykus certekorum</i>, noting that preserved
elements are not duplicated and are properly proportioned to belong to
one individual. The fourteen referred teeth are shed so were admitted
to at least belong to another individual. When entered in Longrich and
Currie's dromaeosaurid analysis, it emerged as a velociraptorine if the
teeth were included, and a member of Velociraptorinae+Dromaeosaurinae
if they were excluded. However, Cau (online, 2015) noted that given the
paucity of remains and number of small Judithian theropod taxa, it
should not be assumed that the frontal belongs to the same individual
as the dromaeosaurid postcrania. Indeed, he reported that when the
frontal is entered into his theropod supermatrix, it emerges in several
position within Maniraptoriformes but never as a dromaeosaurid. My own
analysis finds it to be a coelurosaur excluded from ornithomimosaurs,
alvarezsauroids, therizinosaurs, oviraptorosaurs, unenlagiines,
microraptorians, dromaeosaurines, derived troodontids and birds. As it

may belong to one of the problematic taxa such as <i>Richardoestesia</i>

correct and <i>Richardoestesia</i> is a microraptorian, <i>Boreonykus</i>

(online 2012) and Robbins (online 2009), material exposed on the
surface (cranial elements, manual phalanges and unguals) were collected
in 2002 and nicknamed "Julieraptor" by Thompson, while the rest of the
specimen was excavated by 2006 and nicknamed Sid Vicious by Murphy of
the Judith River Dinosaur Institute.  Once reuninted and after
various
legal issues "the skeleton was returned to the land owner, who arranged
to sell the specimen to the Royal Ontario Museum" (Bakker, online

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype dentary was discovered in 1963-1964
and described by Averianov and Lopatin (2021a) as a new taxon of
dromaeosaurid.  When they entered it into Currie and Longrich's
dromaeosaurid matrix it emerged as a velociraptorine closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> but further than <span style="font-style: italic;">Acheroraptor</span>.<br>
Nessov (1995) noted (translated) "dromaeosaurids (D. A. Russell,
personal
communication, 1988)" from Kansai.  Alifanov and Averianov (2006)
stated that at Kansai "The family Dromaeosauridae is probably
represented by a corpus of a relatively short anterior thoracic
vertebra with a stout hypapophysis (PIN, no. 3041/11)."  Averianov
and Loptain (2021b) stated the vertebra may belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Kansaignathus</span>,

? several unguals (Currie and Azuma, 2006)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The original tooth was informally called
"Kitadani-ryu", as found in Azuma (1991). Lambert (1990)
inappropriately made it into a genus name, listing it as
"Kitadanisaurus" in a childrens' book. Dong et al. (1990) published
photos of the tooth, labeling it Dromaeosauridae indet.. In 1991, jaw
fragments were found in the quarry and identified as dromaeosaurid
based on their fused interdental plates. This was followed by the
discovery of a manual ungual I, astragalus and metatarsal III in 1993.
Azuma and Currie (1995) described these remains in an abstract as those
of a giant dromaeosaurid, which was associated in the paleontological
community with "Kitadanisaurus" through the late 1990's. Azuma and
Currie (2000) later described the skeletal remains as a new taxon of
carnosaur, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>. Yet they also noted smaller teeth are
known, similar in size and shape to dromaeosaurids and sharing <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>'
mesial carina twist, as well as a dorsal vertebra "suggestive of
dromaeosaurid affinities." Currie and Azuma (2006) list the teeth which
are not referrable to <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, and describe and illustrate
a humerus they refer to Dromaeosauridae indet.. In addition, they state
several unguals seem to be dromaeosaurid, though these remain
undescribed. One manual ungual is listed as having a proximodorsal lip,
which is present in most dromaeosaurids as well as some other
coelurosaurs. It is probably one of the several, though the only other
listed ungual is a distal tip (FPDM-V9912141). Even if these remains
are all dromaeosaurid, they do not necessarily belong to the same
taxon. "Kitadanisaurus" remains a nomen nudum, as the original tooth
has never been described.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Gilmore (1920) noted four unguals from the Belly River
Group of Canada in the AMNH (including AMNH 5387) were nearly identical
to the holotype of <i>Coelurus gracilis</i>. Gilmore (1924) believed
they belonged to <i>Chirostenotes</i>, but at least AMNH 5387 more
closely resembles derived dromaeosaurids in being more curved, having
no proximodorsal lip, a more proximally placed flexor tubercle and a
proximally undivided longitudinal groove. It is likely <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
or <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, and the other unguals may be as well.<br>
Russell (1969) listed the presacral vertebrae (CMN 12413 and 12414, UA
5286) as being comparable to <i>Oviraptor</i> in their short centra
and pleurocoels. The sacra (CMN 12438 and 12439) were tentatively
referred to the same taxon, and described as being strongly concave
ventrally and containing five vertebrae. The latter resembles
dromaeosaurids more closely (oviraptorids have at least six sacrals),
many of which also share the presacral characters listed above. They
probably belong to <i>Richardoestesia, Dromaeosaurus</i> or <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
based on provenance. Another possibility is that they are from juvenile
tyrannosaurids. <br>
The three RTMP teeth have a chalky appearence and lack serrations due
to being swallowed and digested. They are thus difficult to assign to
particular genera, but are near certainly coelurosaurs, and probably
dromaeosaurids based on provenence and elongate shape.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Kirkland (1996) initially reported dromaeosaurid teeth from the "middle
fauna" of the Cedar Mountain Formation, seemingly referring to "teeth
possibly referable to the dromaeosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>" from Hotel Mesa
mentioned by Kirkland et al. (1997).  <br>
DeCourten (1998) wrote "A large curving foot claw demonstrates the
presence of dromaeosaurs. This dromaeosaur was much smaller than <span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span> but probably represents
a carnivore much like <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
from the Cloverly Formation of Montana. Until more dromaeosaur material
is found at the Long Walk Quarry scientists cannot be sure about the
exact identity of this theropod, but <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
is a good guess at this point because the claw is almost identical to
those of that genus (Figure 7-12A) and the Cloverly Formation is very
nearly the same age as the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain
Formation."  Unfortunately, Figure 7-12A is only a redrawing of
Ostrom's illustration of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>'
pedal ungual III, said to be "very similar to that found in the Long
Walk Quarry."  So perhaps the Long Walk specimen is also from
digit III.<br>
Chure et al. (2007) reported a non-<span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span>
taxon from Dinosaur National Monument "represented by a partial
skeleton plus isolated elements of a second individual. Femoral length
is ~290 mm. The single mid-dorsal bear a pneumatic foramen on its
centrum. The Monument specimen differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span>
in the extreme height of the ascending process of the astragalus plus
its symmetrical shape, with the apex at mid-width."  <br>
Carpenter
(online 2007) stated "<span><font color="#000000"><span style=""></span>A
single hand claw of <i>Utahraptor</i> is known from near the base of
the Ruby Ranch at Lorrie's Site", and "</font></span><span><font color="#000000">The foot of <i>Deinonychus</i> is known from high in
the Ruby Ranch at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Dinosaur</st1:placename>

<b>Comments</b>- Nelson and Crooks (1987) figure two teeth as
"Theropoda, Troodontidae
(= Saurornithoididae)" from the Rough Road Quarry.  Currie et al.
(1990) said these "are more likely from a velociraptorine because the
denticles are too small (there are 12 posterior denticles per
millimeter in their figures) and elongate."<br>
Material was called cf. <i>Deinonychus sp.</i> nov. by Kirkland et al.
(1997), and noted to be large. Fiorillo (1999) described two teeth
which were strongly compressed, lack mesial serrations, and have distal
serrations which are taller than wide and are straight with a slight
apically oriented hook. He referred these to Velociraptorinae. Cifelli
et al. (1999) state a partial skeleton is known, though do not say if
it is of the "velociraptorine" or "dromaeosaurine" taxon. Cifelli et
al. also list Velociraptorinae indet. teeth.<br>
Avrahami et al. (2016) reported "four complete and several fragmentary
dromaeosaur teeth from an as-yet indeterminate species" from the Cliffs
of Insanity microsite, which by the time of the material's description
(Avrahamai, 2018; Avrahami et al., 2018) included NCSM 33267 and 33275,

<b>Early Bathonian, Middle Jurassic<br>
Chipping Norton Formation, England<br>
Material-</b> (GLRCM coll.; F) tooth (3.5 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was labeled a dromaeosaur-like tooth and said to
be a possible troodontid. It is elongate and moderately recurved, with
mesial serrations present apically. Serrations on both carinae are low
and rounded, with a DSDI of ~2. The base is not constricted and blood
pits are absent. Serration density is 6/mm distally and 13/mm mesially.<br>
This tooth differs from troodontids in lacking a basal constriction and
blood pits, as well as having such a high DSDI. The latter is only
known in some derived dromaeosaurids and <i>Richardoestesia</i>, but
the low serration density excludes it from the latter genus. However,
the low rounded morphology of the distal serrations is not seen in
other dromaeosaurids.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- While seven teeth assigned to Velociraptorinae by
Lubbe et al. (2009), Gerke and Wings (2014) found four of these were
Neotheropoda indet., megalosaurid and tyrannosauroid. Based on the
information in Lubbe et al., FV 658 may be the megalosaurid (larger,
elongate crown, more of mesial carina serrated), FV 382 and 790.5 may
be tyrannosauroid (less recurved and thicker labiolingually), and FV
707.1 may be indet. (larger and only partially preserved).<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Gilmore (1933) noted the presence of "a few foot bones and other
fragmentary skeletal parts" of small theropods from the Iren Dabasu
Formation that he assigned to "Dromaeosaurinae Genus and species
indet.", but admitted that this assignment as opposed to Coeluridae or
Compsognathidae is based purely on their Cretaceous age.  Thus
while it turned out at least two of these elements are apparently
dromaeosaurid (see below), Gilmore's rationale is equivalent to
Maniraptora indet. today and the fossils referenced plausibly included
material now recognized as avimimid, troodontid and
?alvarezsaurid.  Ostrom (1969) noted in a discussion of
deinonychosaur pedal examples that "E. H. Colbert has also discovered
an isolated phalanx (AMNH 6572) in the American Museum collections from
the Iren Dabasu Formation of Mongolia which compares almost exactly
with the proximal phalanx of digit II of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
but is perhaps 20 percent larger", which would make it somewhere around
46-52 mm long.  He shows it questionably derived from <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
in his phylogram without explanation, which would not make sense in the
most recent interpretation of Iren Dabasu's age being contemporaneous
or slightly older than the Djadochta.  Paul (1988) states "at the
AMNH is a hyper-extendable toe bone from the Late Cretaceous of
Mongolia that looks like a <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
somewhat bigger than <span style="font-style: italic;">V. antirrhopus</span>
[= <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>]",
but it is uncertain whether he saw it independant of Ostrom's text
(Paul, pers. comm. 6-2022).  The AMNH online catalog lists AMNH
21781 as an Iren Dabasu member of Dromaeosauridae represented by
"Ungual of pes (digit II)" and being found by Kaisen.  Both AMNH
6572 and 21781 would have been found in Erenhot during the April 22 to
May 25 1923 Central Asiatic Expedition.<br>
Dong et al. (1989) state <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
material was discovered in the July 1988 Sino-Canadian expedition to
Erenhot, and Dong (1992) specifies "teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>".  Currie and
Eberth (1993) state "Isolated dromaeosaurid teeth and bones are common
in the Iren Dabasu" and that "Most of these can be attributed to <i>Velociraptor</i>,
although some of the teeth suggest that there was a second, larger
species of an indeterminate dromaeosaurine dromaeosaurid."  Yet no
rationale was presented, and the only two specified Iren Dabasu
dromaeosaurid elements in the literature are clearly not <i>Velociraptor</i>
(AMNH 6572 is twice
the size, while IVPP 270790-4 is different from most dromaeosaurid
teeth as noted above). AMNH 6572 may belong to the supposed
dromaeosaurine though, based on size.  Currie and Zhao (1993)
figure "Dromaeosaurid tooth (IVPP 270790-4) from
the Iren Dabasu Formation near Erenhot, People's Republic of China,
showing replacement pit on medial side of root", but given the slight
constriction basal to the
crown, convex distal edge and seeming lack of serrations, this may be
misidentified.  Based on its similar field number to troodontid
metatarsal
IVPP 230790-16 it was probably also found in the Sino-Canadian
expedition of 1990.<br>
Funston et al. (2019) notes a femoral head that
supposedly differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
in having fused anterior and greater trochanters, "which suggests that
it may be oviraptorid or, more likely, dromaeosaur."  This is from
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
bonebed (locality K of Currie and Eberth [1993], which was CCDP
locality 1 and may correspond to AMNH locality 141) and recovered in
July 1988.  Interestingly, femur PIN 2549-100 is from the same
locality and shares a trochanteric crest, but is here identified as
oviraptorid.  It's possible they are from the same taxon (or even
individual).<br>
Yao et al. (2015) note "small unarticulated bones and teeth, including
fossils of ... dromaeosaurids" from "a rare microvertebrate locality
within the Iren Dabasu Formation, about 16 km northeast of Erenhot
City."<br>

MNHN teeth were referred to Dromaeosauridae by Knoll and Ruiz-Omenaca
(2009) based on their high DSDI (1.08-1.45). However, this is also
found in many more basal coelurosaurs. While Knoll and Ruiz-Omnaca
(2005) originally noted teeth that "could be related to
"paronychodontids"", the eventual 2009 publication shows this only
refers to GNHN SA mcm 158, which is their Velociraptorinae indet.
Morphotype III and has serrated carinae unlike <i>Paronychodon</i>. 
Knoll and Ruiz-Omenaca considered Morphotype I similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> while Morphotype III is
close to specimens  now recognized as <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
premaxillary
teeth (<span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>, Sankey et
al.'s ?<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> morphotype A).  Lasseron et al. (2020)
stated "it is possible that those potential
dromaeosaurid teeth from the KM fauna belong instead to Noasauridae or
a basal tyrannosauroid (C.

Theropoda gen. et sp. indet. morphotype II is placed here as well due
to the high DSDI (1.67-1.75).  Lasseron finds quantitative
analysis classifies FSAC-KM-A2-9 [1] as the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span>,
perhaps indicating a basal tyrannosauroid position if that genus is
correctly placed here.  Note Lasseron listed FSAC-KM-D2-11 as both
a 'Theropoda gen. et sp.
indet. morphotype I' and 'Theropoda gen. et sp. indet. morphotype II'
tooth, without using a number in brackets to designate multiple teeth
falling under one specimen number.  As the mesial serration
density is
listed, the measurements given belong to a morphotype II tooth. 
Lasseron et al. lists all four teeth under FSAC-KM-B'-26 as
Dromaeosauridae, although Lasseron described three as Theropoda gen. et
sp. indet. morphotype III, Coelurosauria gen. et sp. indet. morphotype
I and Coelurosauria gen. et sp. indet. morphotype III (unnamed
Averostra and Coelurosauria here).  Similarly, they list
FSAC-KM-D1-6 as dromaeosaurid, but it was described as Coelurosauria
gen. et sp. indet. morphotype I by Lasseron and is catalogd under
unnamed Coelurosauria here.  Lasseron et al. list both
FSAC-KM-A2-9 teeth as Maniraptora, but they were described as Theropoda
gen. et sp. indet. morphotypes I and II by Lasseron. <br>

depth by Rauhut and Werner (1995).<br>
Vb-714 was originally identified as a pedal ungual II, but is more
likely a manual ungual based on the high dorsal arch and large flexor
tubercle. The similar partial ungual Vb-860 (also assigned to pedal
digit II by Rauhut and Werner) may also be from the manus then. Vb-867
was also identified as a pedal ungual II, but was not illustrated. The
high DSDI (1.33) was used to place this in the Velociraptorinae, but
are also known in microraptorians and basal dromaeosaurines. It does
exclude the Sudanese taxon from the <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>+<i>Achillobator</i>+<i>Utahraptor</i>
subclade, as does the elongate pedal phalanx II-2.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Senter et al. (2004) erected Microraptoria, with a
non-family level suffix to ensure ICZN rules are followed whether or
not the clade was within Dromaeosauridae (depending on both the tree's
topology and the latter's definition). They listed Microraptoridae and
Microraptorinae as alternatives considered prior to deciding upon
Microraptoria, and Microraptorini as a mispelling of Microraptoria.
Makovicky et al. (2005) cited Senter et al. for Microraptorinae, but
the latter was a misspelling of their own (Headden, pers. comm. to
Makovicky, 2005). Turner et al. (2007) followed Makovicky et al. in
using Microraptorinae, but neither reference contains a diagnosis or
definition so the name is a nomen nudum (ICZN Article 13.1.1). While
Makovicky et al. did reference Senter et al.'s paper, which included a
definition for Microraptoria, the latter is not an available name under
the ICZN so Article 13.1.3 does not apply. In addition, ICZN Article
11.5 states names must be proposed as being valid, so Senter et al.
2004 cannot be cited as the authors for Microraptorinae/idae, contra
most authors discussed here. This leaves Longrich and Currie (2009) as
the first publication to validy erect Microraptorinae. Turner et al.
(2012) gave Microraptorinae a more restrictive definition that
supposedly overcomes Senter et al.'s perceived difficulties with
family-level names. However, in topologies such as Mayr et al.'s
(2005), Microraptorinae does not fall under any named family, which was
just the problem Senter et al. anticipated when they rejected the name.
On the other hand, Microraptoria includes <i>Confuciusornis</i> and
potentially all pygostylians in Mayr et al.'s topology, unlike
Microraptorinae. So Turner et al.'s definition is more stable due to
its extra specifiers. At present, however, the consensus is that
Microraptorinae and Microraptoria are synonymous, and the latter has
priority. <br>

(PMOL coll.) (2.5 m) complete skeleton (Makovicky, Gorscak and Zhou,
2018)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zheng et al., 2010) small and extremely
slender furcula; elongated hindlimb about three times as long as dorsal
series.<br>
(after Lu and Brusatte, 2015) short forelimb (humerofemoral ratio
&lt;0.65, ulnofemoral ratio &lt;0.55, manuofemoral ratio &lt;0.90;
actual values 0.63, 0.53 and 0.76; values of <i>Tianyuraptor</i>
holotype 0.65, 0.49 and 0.86; with the humerofemoral ratio barely
excepted) (also in <i>Achillobator</i> - ?, 0.51 and ?).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Turner et al. (2012) note Zheng et al.'s
character of 'length of mid caudal vertebrae more than twice that of
dorsal vertebrae' is present in <i>Microraptor</i> as well.<br>
Lu and Brusatte (2015) listed several characters in their
diagnosis. <i>Adasaurus</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>
also have six sacral vertebrae.  <i>Graciliraptor</i>, <i>Microraptor</i>,
<i>Velociraptor</i>, <i>Achillobator</i> and some <i>Deinonychus</i>
have a radius thinner than manual phalanx I-1. Metacarpal II is shorter
than metacarpal I plus manual phalanx I-1 in eudromaeosaurs (<i>Velociraptor</i>,
<i>Tsaagan</i>, <i>Deinonychus</i>), <i>Bambiraptor</i>, <i>Tianyuraptor</i>
(contra Lu and Brusatte) and some <i>Microraptor</i> (LPM 0159). Lu
and Brusatte stated the posteriorly curved pubis differs from the
straight element in <i>Tianyuraptor</i>, but the latter is also
posteriorly curved. While they said the ilium of <i>Tianyuraptor</i>
differs from "Zhenyuanlong" in sharing a lobate brevis shelf with <i>Microraptor</i>,
this seems to be absent in <i>Tianyuraptor</i>'s type based on
available low resolution photos. They also said "Zhenyuanlong" differs
from <i>Tianyuraptor</i> in having a ridge along the ventral
antorbital fossa edge, but the former has a narrow and convex surface
ventral to the fossa, not a ridge compared to the rest of the external
surface. Lu and Brusatte also included two characters shared with <i>Tianyuraptor</i>
and eudromaeosaurs- mid-pubic tubercle absent (plesiomorphic), and mid
dorsal ischial process absent (also in <i>Unenlagia</i> and <i>Buitreraptor</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The description was released online in August 2009 but
not officially published until January 2010.<br>
The holotype of "Zhenyuanlong" was collected by a farmer prior to 2015.
Lu and Brusatte (2015) believed the Sihedang locality, which it derives
from, to be in the Yixian Formation.  It is here assigned to the
Jiufotang Formation instead (see <span style="font-style: italic;">Iteravis</span>
entry).  The taxon was described by Lu and Brusatte on
July 16 2015 as a new genus
of dromaeosaurid.  However, this paper has no mention of ZooBank
and as of February 6 2020
"Zhenyuanlong" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.  Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Zhenyuanlong suni" Lu and
Brusatte 2015 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically.<br>
Valid differences between <span style="font-style: italic;">Tianyuraptor</span>
and "Zhenyuanlong" noted by Lu and Brusatte are limited to- radius
thinner than manual phalanx I-1; smaller manus (76% of femoral length
vs. 86%). These could easily be explainable as individual variation, as
the former varies in <i>Deinonychus</i>. 
Makovicky et al. (2018) noted a new specimen which "exhibits a
combination of traits that were previously used to distinguish <span style="font-style: italic;">Tianyuraptor</span> from
Zhenyuanlong."  <br>
Zheng et al. (2010) found <i>Tianyuraptor</i> to be more closely
related to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> than <i>Unenlagia</i>, but outside
previously described microraptorians, and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
plus <i>Velociraptor</i> plus dromaeosaurines. It was recovered as a
microraptorian by Senter et al. (2012), Turner et al. (2012) and Lee et
al. (2014), but in a polytomy with microraptorians and more derived
dromaeosaurids by Brusatte et al. (2014).  Lu and Brusatte added
"Zhenyuanlong" to Turner's TWiG analysis and found it to be in a
polytomy with the microraptorian genera, <i>Tianyuraptor</i> and
Eudromaeosauria. <br>

<b>Material</b>- (BYU 2022) distal radius <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Jensen (1981) described the holotype (BYU 2022) as a
proximal tibiotarsus of a new taxon of bird- "Paleopteryx thomsoni". In
addition, he referred a proximal femur (BYU 2023) to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
and another femur (BYU 2025) and sacrum (BYU 2024) as avian-like.
Molnar (1985) showed that "Paleopteryx" was not diagnosed, so is a
nomen nudum (ICZN Article 13.1.1). He assigned the BYU material to
Theropoda. Jensen and Padian reidentified BYU 2022 as a distal radius,
and referred both it and BYU 2023 to Maniraptora indet.. They made BYU
2024 the holotype of a new pterosaur genus <i>Mesadactylus</i>, and
referred BYU 2025 to that taxon as well.<br>
"Paleopteryx" actually has an extremely distinctive distal radius, with
a medially flared articular surface seen in dromaeosaurids, <i>Sapeornis</i>
and <i>Confuciusornis</i>, but absent in therizinosaurs,
oviraptorosaurs, <i>Yixianosaurus</i>, <i>Sinornithoides</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
<i>Rahonavis</i> or <i>Shenzhouraptor</i>. The high angle of flaring
relative to the shaft is shared with <i>Graciliraptor</i> and <i>Microraptor</i>
among dromaeosaurids, unlike <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Bambiraptor</i>.
It is more similar to <i>Graciliraptor</i>, in that both lack <i>Microraptor</i>'s
apomorphic concave surface just distal to the flare. An additional
character shared with <i>Microraptor</i> but not other maniraptorans
(unknown in <i>Graciliraptor</i>) is a distally projecting lateral
process. "Paleopteryx" is thus here assigned to Microraptoria.<br>

<p><b><i>Richardoestesia</i></b> Currie, Rigby and Sloan, 1990<br>
= <i>Asiamericana</i> Nessov, 1995<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- very small serrations on teeth (5-12/mm); apical half
of anterior dentary teeth convex distally.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This genus is known from a large amount of teeth,
spanning the Bathonian to Maastrichtian of North and South America,
Europe and Asia. The only known nondental remains are the holotype
dentaries, though it's probable some of the many unidentified small
theropod postcranial remains so far discovered belonged to individuals
with <i>Richardoestesia</i>-type teeth. The wide temporal and
geographic range suggests <i>Richardoestesia</i> as currently
diagnosed is a clade comparable to "families" in scope, and quite
possibly polyphyletic. The two named species, <i>R. gilmorei</i> and <i>R.
isosceles</i>, show variation between different formations that
probably indicate they each contain several species. <i>R. cf. gilmorei</i>
is indistinguishable from <i>Saurornitholestes</i> in the Early
Campanian Milk River Formation except for serration size, though the
possible presence of <i>gilmorei</i>-like teeth from earlier
formations may indicate this is not due to <i>R. gilmorei</i> evolving
from a dromaeosaurid in the Early Campanian. However, these earlier
records are based on unpublished observations from a single figure
(Chipping Norton Formation) and a single specimen which seems to have
serrations too large for <i>Richardoestesia</i> (Woodbine Formation). <i>R.
isosceles</i>-like specimens have a more definitive pre-Campanian
record and are the only ones verified from Eurasia, where they extend
back to the Kimmeridgian of Portugal. Though the pre-Campanian American
records should be examined before any conclusions are made, it seems
possible <i>R. isosceles</i> originated much earlier than <i>R.
gilmorei</i> and had little to do with that species. It should also be
noted that many poorly described records of <i>Richardoestesia</i> may
belong to other genera such as basal tyrannosauroids (e.g. <i>Nuthetes</i>,
<i>Dilong</i>) or other basal dromaeosaurids (e.g. <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
<i>Shanag</i>). Indeed, both <i>Shanag</i> and <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
have very small serrations on their teeth, and some teeth whose apical
half is convex distally. Hendrickx and Mateus (2014) found <i>Richardoestesia</i>
to be a dromaeosaurid in their phylogenetic analysis.<br>
<b><i>Richardoestesia</i> or <i>Ricardoestesia</i>?</b>- Olshevsky and
others have noted that the spelling of this genus was originally
supposed to be <i>Ricardoestesia</i>, and was misspelled in all cases
except for a figure caption in the original description by an editor.
Thus, Olshevsky believes <i>Ricardoestesia</i> should be the correct
spelling. However, he acted as first revisor in 1991, listing <i>Richardoestesia</i>
as the correct spelling and <i>Ricardoestesia</i> as a misspelling. As
Creisler (DML, 2002) noted- "Under ICZN Art. 24.2.3, the first author
to have cited two alternate spellings of a name together and to have
selected one spelling as correct qualifies as the First Reviser. Under
32.5.1, this spelling could only be changed if it is determined to be
"incorrect"--meaning there is evidence of an inadverent error in the
original publication itself "without recourse to any external source of
information." Crucially, "incorrect transliteration or latinization" is
not considered an inadvertent error.<br>
As I pointed out back in Feb. 2001, "Richardus" is a perfectly good
latinization for Richard, and one widely used in Medieval and later
Latin literature. Since the name was intended to honor Richard Estes,
the latinized form <i>Richardoestesia</i> is perfectly good and not in
any way readable as "inadvertent error." If one of the authors of the
original paper wanted <i>Ricardoestesia</i> instead, his wish
qualifies as an "external source of information" which can't be used,
since it's not mentioned in the original paper. Moreover, the senior
author on the original <i>Richardoestesia</i> paper was Phil Currie,
who has used the spelling <i>Richardoestesia</i> in other papers he
has authored or coauthored.<br>
Frankly, I can't find any basis in the ICZN for switching the spellings
in later editions of Mesozoic Meanderings. George had in fact already
been the First Reviser on the name in Oct. 1991. Since generic names
differing by one letter are not homonyms, the coexistence of <i>Richardoestesia</i>
and <i>Ricardoestesia</i> for the same taxon is becoming more
confusing as time goes on, especially with electronic data retrieval
and online databases. As the situation is shaping up, nearly all
technical papers are using <i>Richardoestesia</i> and a few books have
used <i>Ricardoestesia</i>. Maybe the ICZN will have to make a
decision, but it seems like a lot of fuss over an issue that was
settled just fine by George in 1991."<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Campanian, Late Cretaceous</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Mesaverde Formation, Wyoming, US<br>
</span>(RAM 24759) tooth (Farke, Letteau Stallings and Andrews, 2020)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (from Sankey et al., 2002) differs from <i>R.
isosceles</i> in- teeth generally shorter, more recurved and larger;
serrations not square shaped, and with small interdenticle spaces; some
teeth constricted at base.<br>
differs from <i>Shanag</i> in- shallow Mackelian groove; some teeth
constricted at base; all teeth have distal serrations; some teeth have
mesial serrations.<br>
differs from <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> in- shallow Mackelian groove;
Mackelian groove placed more dorsally; unfused posterior dentary
interdental plates; at least some premaxillary teeth serrated distally;
some teeth constricted at base; anterior dentary teeth convex
distoapically.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1917 and described in
1924 by Gilmore as a provisionally referred specimen of <i>Chirostenotes</i>
(now known to be an oviraptorosaur whose mandibles were named <i>Caenagnathus</i>).
Currie et al. (1990) soon described it as a new genus after Currie and
Russell (1988) recognized <i>Chirostenotes</i> as an oviraptorosaur.
Currie et al. did leave open the possibility <i>Richardoestesia</i>
could be synonymous with <i>Chirostenotes</i> or <i>Elmisaurus</i>
however.<br>
Horseshoe Canyon Formation <i>Richardoestesia gilmorei</i> are said to
be identical to Judith River specimens by Baszio (1997), but taller by
Larson et al. (2010). Though <i>R. gilmorei</i> has been reported from
the Cenomanian-Maastrichtian of the US and Canada (e.g. Baszio, 1997),
these are slightly different from Judith River specimens when examined
and it is likely they are separate species.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This tooth was labeled as "dromaeosaur-like" by
Metcalf and Walker (1994).<br>
Mesial serrations are absent, and the crown is elongate and recurved.
Serrations are fairly flat and not hooked apically, but are taller than
wide. Serration density is 19/mm. Blood grooves are not apparent. <br>
The high serration density is characteristic of <i>Richardoestesia</i>,
while the serration size compared to FABL and curvature match <i>R.

this tooth from <i>R. gilmorei</i> can be determined, though it is
smaller than most specimens of that species.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- VIC 17 is short and recurved, with 10 distal serraions
per mm, and 15 mesial serrations per mm. The distal serrations seem
rounded and perpendicular to the crown, while the mesial serrations are
only present in the apical portion. The BW/FABL is about .44. Though
assigned to Dromaeosauridae by Buffetaut et al. (1986), the small
serration size and high DSDI make it almost identical to <i>Richardoestesia
gilmorei</i>. Its curvature, short crown, and perhaps constricted base
distinguish it from <i>R. isosceles</i>.<br>
Buffetaut et al. (1996) later noted several small laterally compressed
and serrated teeth which they referred to small theropods, possibly
dromaeosaurids. These are tentatively retained here untl they are
described further.<br>

Paratype</b>- (RTMP 91.170.9) tooth <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (from Sankey et al., 2002) differs from <i>R.
gilmorei</i> in- teeth generally longer, straighter and smaller;
serrations square-shaped, and with larger interdenticle spaces; no
teeth constricted at base.<br>
differs from <i>Shanag</i> in- teeth straighter and generally longer;
all teeth have distal serrations; some teeth have mesial serrations.<br>
differs from <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> in- teeth straighter and
generally longer.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Russell (1935) first reported these kinds of teeth and
hypothesized they were tyrannosaurid ("deinodont") premaxillary teeth.
Estes (1964) believed them to be from juvenile theropods, while Sahni
(1972) tentatively assigned them to Sebecosuchia. They were first
connected to <i>Richardoestesia</i> <i>gilmorei</i> remains by Currie
et al. (1990), who suspected they belonged to a new species of that
genus. It was referred to as <i>Richardoestesia sp.</i> by Baszio
(1997) and other sources until being named by Sankey in 2001. Sankey's
paratypes are from several formations, and the species has been
reported from the Early Campanian to the Late Maastrichtian of North
America. These show very little variation (Baszio, 1997) though we may
assume more than one species was present in this time interval.
Additional similar teeth are known from the Late Jurassic to Late
Cretaceous of Eurasia and the Early Cretaceous of the US, but differ
slightly and are referred to new unnamed species below. <i>R. isosceles</i>
only shares a couple apomorphic features with <i>R. gilmorei</i> (tiny
serrations, convex distoapical edge of some teeth) and may not be
closely related. The fact its lineage extends back to Kimmeridgian
Europe, while <i>R. gilmorei</i> seems to emerge from dromaeosaurid
teeth in the Early Campanian of North America may support this view.
However, Williamson and Brusatte (2014) note both <i>gilmorei</i>-like
and <i>isosceles</i>-like teeth from the Fruitland Formation have a
high DSDI, suggesting they derive from the same species. Sankey (2002)
has suggested <i>Paronychodon</i> and <i>Richardoestesia</i> teeth
are morphotypes of the same taxon, based on morphology and relative
abundance. The details of this study have yet to be published, though
it does make sense stratigraphically, as both taxa first appear in Late
Jurassic Europe and spread to North America in the Albian, with Late
Cretaceous examples known from the western North America, central Asia
and Europe. It's also logical anatomically, as <i>Richardoestesia?
isosceles</i> would be expected to have some unserrated and possibly
constricted teeth if it were microraptorian. It should be noted <i>Paronychodon</i>
has priority over <i>Richardoestesia</i>, and <i>lacustris</i> and <i>caperatus</i>
both have priority over <i>isosceles</i>. Also, <i>Euronychodon</i>
has priority over <i>Asiamericana</i>, and <i>portuculensis</i> has
priority over both <i>asiatica</i> and <i>asiaticus</i>. So if this
synonymy is proven, none of the names associated with straight-toothed <i>Richardoestesia</i>
will survive synonymization.  Averianov and Sues (2019) believe "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. isosceles</span> cannot be
differentiated from <span style="font-style: italic;">R. asiatica</span>",
but nonsensically also suggest <span style="font-style: italic;">R.
isosceles</span>
"should rather be treated as a nomen dubium" because the type tooth
"appears to be rather short, with distinctly convex crown sides. This
contrasts with the other straight teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span>,
which have a proportionally taller crown with straight or only slightly
convex crown margins."  The shortness could be simply due to being
incomplete basally, it and the degree of convexity are not shown to
differ from all other supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">R.
isosceles</span>
specimens, let alone those from the type Aguja Formation, and if its
differences were taxonomically significant it would be a valid taxon
instead of a nomen dubium (which is more realistic given the temporal
and geographical separation).  Further, while a fragmentary type
may be
problematic in some circumstances, the difference between a complete
and incomplete tooth is negligible.  In any case, the species are
kept
separate here based on the previously noted geographical and temporal
difference, and this may even be defensible morphologically pending
study of the other Aguja Formation <span style="font-style: italic;">R.
isosceles</span> specimens.<br>
Ryan and Russell (2001) list "uncatalogd TMP teeth" as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Richardsoestesia</span> n. sp. Baszio
1997b" from the Foremost Formation, which are some of the six <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span> teeth reported by
Peng et al. (2001) from the PHR-1 and PHR-2 localities.  The
latter listed "RTMP96.62.26 and -31" as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span>
sp. Baszio, 1997" from the Foremost and Oldman Formations, so one of
those numbers represents the less than six Foremost Formation <span style="font-style: italic;">R. isoscele</span>s teeth.<br>
The tooth LSUMG 140:6140 was first referred to <i>Saurornitholestes
cf. langstoni</i> by Sankey (2001) before being identified as <i>R?
isosceles</i>
by Sankey et al. (2002). Similarly, Oldman tooth RTMP 89.103.25 was
identified as Aves indet. by Sankey et al. (2002) before being
reidentified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia
isolsceles</span> by Larson and Currie (2013) and Dumont et al. (2016).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- indistinguishable from <i>R. isosceles</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1989) first published these teeth as
?Spinosauridae, then (1995) named it <i>Asiamericana asiatica</i> and
considered it to be either a spinosaurid or a saurodontid fish.
However, he noted resemblence between the holotype and a tooth (AMNH
8113) that has since been referred to <i>Richardoestesia isosceles</i>.
Ryan (1997) first mentioned <i>Richardoestesia</i> teeth from this
formation. Sues and Averianov (2013) redescribed the teeth as a species
of <i>Richardoestesia</i>, finding it's indistinguishable from <i>R.
isosceles</i>, contra Buffetaut et al. (2008) who stated it was
certainly a saurodontid. The holotype teeth were initially described as
lacking serrations, but Sues and Averianov show this is untrue.
Notably, <i>asiatica</i> has precedence over <i>isosceles</i>, though
the species are unlikely to be synonymous given the geographical and
age difference.  This contrasts with Averianov and Sues (2019) who
while agreeing "<span style="font-style: italic;">R. isosceles</span>
cannot be differentiated from <span style="font-style: italic;">R.
asiatica</span>", nonsensically also suggest <span style="font-style: italic;">R. isosceles</span> "should rather be
treated as a nomen dubium" (see Comments under <span style="font-style: italic;">R. isosceles</span>).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These are identified as cf.<i> Troodon sp.</i>

Frederickson
et al. (2018) lists these as "?troodontid" but also say they "have
relatively smaller denticles than those of most Late Cretaceous
troodontids ... ; though more associated material is needed to
unequivocally dismiss this identification."  They also noted
Fiorillo
(1999) identified this morphotype as Velociraptorinae.  Given the
lack
of mesial serrations, small size, Middle Cretaceous timing and
longitudinal grooves on some specimens, these are here suggested to be
microraptorians.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These teeth were referred to Dromaeosauridae by
Averianov et al. (2003), but are here specified as microraptorians
based on their small serrations (9-10/mm mesially, 6-9/mm distally).
The anterior tooth is elongate and only slightly curved, while the
posterior teeth are short and strongly recurved. The BW/FABL of the
anterior tooth is .47, and the posterior teeth .52-.56. The mesial
carinae follow the midline and are serrated only basally on the
anterior tooth. Posterior serrations are rectangular, broad
labiolingually, and have short shallow interdenticle slits. They
resemble teeth of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> and <i>Richardoestesia</i>.

<b>Comments</b>- There are many undescribed microraptorian specimens
photographed online, most for sale. These are usually advertised as <i>Microraptor</i>,
but may also belong to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. They are all probably
from the Yixian or perhaps Juifotang Formations of Liaoning. Many are
altered or composites. Alexander et al. (2010) reported seeing over
three hundred microraptorian specimens at the IVPP, Dalian Natural
History Museum and Shandong Tianyu Museum of Natural History. <br>
A specimen on sale at The Natural Canvas is labeled as <i>Microraptor
gui</i>. It has a disarticulated skull and its precise affinities
cannot be determined without better photographs. Another specimen is
preserved spread in dorsal view and seems basically complete besides
one distal pes. Its affinities cannot be determined yet either.<br>
Three dromaeosaurid specimens were exhibited at the China Jehol Biota
Fossil Exhibition in 2002 (Creisler, DML 2002) from the personal
collection of Du Wenya, who runs a museum in Jinzhou. These were
available at least in 2000 (Hutchinson, DML 2000). DNO: 087 is fairly
complete but very poorly preserved. The specimen is obviously altered,
as the tibiotarsi and femora are switched (giving the illusion of long
femora), while one pes is far too short. The pelvic elements are mixed
up as well, with possible proximal pubes located anteriorly, and two
other elements located posteriorly. <br>
DNO: 090 is a composite specimen, as shown by the obviously
confuciusornithid pes (Hutchinson, DML 2000). One pes is attached to a
broken tibia(?), while the other is placed at the end of what may be
another bird tarsmetatarsus. Both are far too short compared to the
femora, one of which is much longer and apparently constructed of two
limb bones. The pubis appears too slender and pointed for a
dromaeosaurid, resembling those of avialans more. One humerus appears
to have a proximal foramen like <i>Confuciusornis</i> and <i>Sapeornis</i>.
One of the lower arms and manus appears genuinely microraptorian,
though the other lower arm is much too short with a far too robust
"radius". The other possible manus is too poorly preserved to evaluate.
The dentary and tail both appear to be dromaeosaurid.<br>

mm), distal metatarsals IV, phalanges IV-1 (17, ~17 mm), phalanx IV-2
(10.8 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu and Wang, 2004) astragalar medial condyle
significantly expanded posteriorly; metatarsal II 1.5 times wider than
metatarsal III distally.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Turner et al. (2012) note several characters
listed in the original diagnosis are problematic. The elongate caudals,
slender tibiotarsus and pedal phalanx III-1 are shared with <i>Microraptor</i>,
the postzygapophyseal laminae on distal caudals and rectangular
proximal section of the tibia are common in dromaeosaurids, the
proximal end of metacarpal III is not very dorsoventrally expanded, and
manual ungual I is not necessarily small compared to ungual II due to
the latter being crushed.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 2001, this was initially described in
Xu's (2002) thesis, then published in 2004. Turner et al. (2012)
consider it a possible synonym of <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>, though
it falls outside the <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>+<i>Microraptor</i> clade
in Foth et al. (2014) and Lee et al. (2014). <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (from Xu et al., 1999) elongate posterolateral
parietal process (unknown in other derived microraptorines).<br>
(after Xu and Wu, 2001) groove posterior to the anterior carina on the
lingual surface of the premaxillary tooth crowns (unknown in other
derived microraptorines); column-like margin of the pterygoid process
of the quadrate (unknown in other derived microraptorines); large
excavation on the posterolateral surface of the cultriform process
(unknown in other derived microraptorines).<br>
(after Turner et al., 2012) thickened posterior rim of promaxillary
fenestra (unknown in other derived microraptorines).<br>
(proposed) larger humerus than <i>Microraptor</i> or <i>Bambiraptor</i>
(humerofemoral ratio &gt;88%) (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Xu et al. (1999) listed additional
synapomorphies of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. However, the pitted
antorbital fossa, elongate posterodorsal dentary process, enlarged
supracoracoid fenestra, lateral tubercle on the pubic midshaft, and
proximodorsal ischial process are also present in <i>Microraptor</i>
(and the pubic character in <i>Hesperonychus</i>); unserrated
premaxillary teeth and a subarctometatarsus are near certainly
plesiomorphic for dromaeosaurids and found in other microraptorians;
the manual phalanx III-1/III-2 ratio of <i>S. millenii</i> falls
between those of <i>Microraptor</i> specimens.<br>
Contra Xu and Wu (2001), the large promaxillary fenestra is now known
to be present in <i>Microraptor</i> as well. The deep excavation on
the posteroventral margin of the premaxilla is also present in <i>Bambiraptor</i>.
Turner et al. (2012) note the supposed diastema between premaxillary
and maxillary teeth is actually the ventral edge of the subnarial
process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>' holotype was discovered in
1998. It was named and briefly described by Xu et al. (1999), and
described in depth in Xu's (2002) thesis, though only the cranial (Xu
and Wu, 2001) and pedal (Wu and Wang, 2000) portions have been
published. Skrepnick (DML, 2000) noted that <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
had the working name of "Sinavisaurus" until right before it was
published. The species name must be emended to <i>millennii</i>
because it's a mispelling of a Latin word (millennium) (ICZN Art. 32.5).<br>
IVPP V16904 was first published as IVPP uncatalogd by Turner et al.
(2012), but Xu et al. (2015) reveal its specimen number. Xu et al. do
not believe it to be conspecific with <i>S. millenii</i> because none
of its teeth are serrated, and its neurocentral sutures are fully
closed and a tibiotarsus is developed despite it being "significantly
smaller" than the holotype which lacks these fusions. While possibly
correct pending further description, it should be noted the referred
specimen of <i>Mei long</i> has a tibiotarsus and fused presacral
neurocentral sutures but is 80% the size of the holotype that doesn't,
the <i>Sinovenator changii</i> paratype has a tibiotarsus but is 89%
the size of the holotype that doesn't, and <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>
specimens can have serrations on both carinae (NGMC 00-12-A), only
distal serrations (holotype) or no serrations (IVPP V13320). Thus such
variations are known in other basal paravian species, so are expected
in <i>S. millenii</i> individuals.<br>
Ji et al. (2002) referred NGMC 91 to <i>Sinornithosaurus sp.</i>, and
it has been referred to <i>S. millenii</i> by other authors such as
Senter (2011) and Turner et al. (2012), but it is here referred to a
new genus more closely related to <i>Microraptor</i>. Xu (2002)
referred IVPP V13477 to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> sp., but Xu et al.
(2003) later made it a paratype of <i>Microraptor gui</i>. Ji (2002)
described NGMC 00-12-A as <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> sp., but it is here
referred to <i>Microraptor</i>.<br>
Gong et al. (2010) argued <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> was venomous, but
Gianechini et al. (2011) show the paper is highly flawed and its
conclusions lack merit. <br>
Several undescribed specimens are photographed online, and appear to be
<i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. They are probably all from the Yixian or
perhaps Juifotang Formations of Liaoning, China.<br>
One is complete and largely articulated except for the pelvis and
hindlimbs. It is being sold by Geosciences Enterprises as <i>Microraptor
zhaoianus</i>. The nasal is disarticulated, making the skull appear
more slender and troodontid-like, but the proportions all match <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>.
The elongate manual phalanx III-3 distinguishes it from <i>Microraptor</i>,
while the short ulna and long manual digit II distinguish it from <i>Graciliraptor</i>.<br>
Another is quite disarticulated, but well preserved. The elongate
tibiotarsus suggests it is <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>.<br>
A further specimen is almost complete and well preserved, except both
manus are fragmentaty and one distal tibia is missing. The pes is
positioned directly contacting the broken end, suggesting some
alteration. The skull is almost complete and looks particularily
elongate.<br>
Three dromaeosaurid specimens were exhibited at the China Jehol Biota
Fossil Exhibition in 2002 (Creisler, DML 2002) from the personal
collection of Du Wenya, who runs a museum in Jinzhou. These were
available at least in 2000 (Hutchinson, DML 2000). DNO: 088 is possibly
the specimen illustrated by Kaiser (2007) as an unidentified
confuciusornithid. It is obviously dromaeosaurid however, with an
elongate tail, slender metatarsus, and slender furcula. The elongate
tibia suggests it may be <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. <br>
Gong et al. (2010) mention specimens from the Tianyu Museum, and later
(2011) illustrate a skull from Zheng (2009). <br>
<i><b>Sinornithosaurus haoiana</b></i>- Liu et al. (2004) described
D2140 as a new species of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>, <i>S. haoiana</i>.
This was based on several proposed differences from <i>S. millenii</i>,
but Turner et al. have proposed the two species are synonymous. The
long subnarial process of the premaxilla which excludes the maxilla
from the naris cannot be evaluated in <i>S. millenii</i>. They further
note the maxillary fenestra of the <i>millenii</i> holotype is heavily
damaged, so the small and circular morphology of <i>haoiana</i> cannot
be compared. Turner et al. find the dorsal quadratojugal process of <i>millenii</i>
to be longer than thought by Xu, which can indeed be seen in photos.
They state both holotypes have low premaxillae, and yet do not argue
against Liu et al.'s correct observation <i>millenii</i>'s are much
lower. Similarly, they argue all specimens have low dentaries, but do
not argue against Liu et al.'s correct observation <i>millenii</i>'s
are much lower. Turner et al. are wrong when they claim <i>millenii</i>
has a pubic peduncle narrower than its acetabulum. I would use these
three differences to retain them as separate species if not for IVPP
V16904 having both a tall premaxilla and a low dentary (fig. 23C in
Turner et al.), which ironically is not used in Turner et al.'s
argument. Based on this specimen, I agree the species are synonymous.
The species name must be emended to <i>haoianus</i>,
to match the gender of the genus name (ICZN Art. 31.2, 34.2). Han et
al. (2014) provided more measurements.   Poust et al. (2020)
examined the histology, finding it to be more mature than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span> holotype.  Paul (2024)
uses <span style="font-style: italic;">Jeholraptor haoiana</span> for
the taxon, stating "Usual placement in earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">S. millenii</span> incorrect because of
very different quadratojugals and other reasons. L-shaped
quadratojugals in this and <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span>
suggest they are more closely related to one another than to other
microraptorines and probably form their own subgroup" and "Smaller
furcula, sternum, and less gracile hand suggest was not as good a flier
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>." 
It's a nomen nudum based on ICZN Article 16.1 at least- "Every new name
published after 1999, including new replacement names (nomina nova),
must be explicitly indicated as intentionally new."  I would
dispute that <span style="font-style: italic;">haoiana</span> has an
L-shaped quadratojugal, it's just that <span style="font-style: italic;">millenii</span> has a shorter dorsal
process.  And even though <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span>'s
skull is illustrated
that way in its description, the photo suggests that whole corner of
the bone is unpreserved.  Purported pectoral and forelimb
differences deserve more scrutiny, but (for instance) one sternal plate
contacts a humerus and could project below it to increase its length
past what the text states.  It should also be noted that Paul
synonymizes <span style="font-style: italic;">Graciliraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptovolans</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Changyuraptor</span> under <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>, so <span style="font-style: italic;">haoiana</span> being more distinct than
these might be especially questionable.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- NGMC 91 was first reported by Ji et al. (2001) as
Dromaeosauridae indet., though they noted strong resemblence to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>.
Ji et al. noted the possibility that some differences, such as the
bowed first metacarpal, were due to age. Ji et al. (2002) later
assigned NGMC 91 to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> sp., with the same
reservations regarding whether differences from the <i>S. millenii</i>
holotype were taxonomic or ontogenetic. Czerkas et al. (2002)
tentatively referred NGMC 91 to their new genus <i>Cryptovolans</i> (=
<i>Microraptor</i>), though without stated reasons besides "nearly
identical wing proportions". In fact, NGMC 91 lacks the proposed
apomorphies of <i>Cryptovolans</i> (28-30 caudal vertebrae; manual
phalanx III-1 longer than III-3), and several apomorphies of <i>Microraptor</i>-
posterior dentary teeth with constricted bases; manual phalanx III-1
&gt;83% of phalanx III-3 in length; manual phalanx I-1 &lt;62% of
metacarpal II in length; tibiofemoral ratio &lt;136%; highly elongate
leg remiges (&gt;1.5 times femoral length). Senter et al. (2004) found
that NGMC 91 claded with <i>Microraptor</i> based on- mesial
serrations absent on posterior teeth; dentary with midlength increase
in height. Senter has since (2007) stated the dentary character's
"apparent presence was an optical illusion caused by differing heights
of preserved dentary teeth and the curvature of the dentary." He still
found the <i>Microraptor</i>+NGMC 91 clade however, supported by a
proximodorsal lip on manual ungual I and strongly curved pedal unguals
III and IV. Senter (2011) has since combined NGMC 91 into his <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
OTU without justification, and Turner et al. (2012) also placed the
specimen in <i>Sinornithosaurus millenii</i>. This was because they
claimed it differed from <i>Microraptor</i> in lacking mid caudal
vertebrae 3-4 times length of anterior dorsal vertebrae, but this is
untrue. Further, the supposed <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> apomorphy of a
posteriorly bifurcated dentary is also present in <i>Microraptor</i>.
It is retained as separate here.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
This specimen was transferred from a private collector to the Dalian
Natural History Museum prior to April 2014 (based on SVP abstract
deadlines).  Poust (2014) first described and
named <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span> in his thesis,
with the disclaimer "This thesis is not
intended to constitute publication of new names or nomenclatural acts
and such names as are given are not here intended for public and
permanent scientific record &acirc;&#8364;&#8220; this is a model of what will be published
later."  This means the thesis falls under ICZN Article 8.2 "A
work that contains a statement to the effect that it is not issued for
public and permanent scientific record, or for purposes of zoological
nomenclature, is not published within the meaning of the Code", and the
name was a nomen nudum until Poust et al. described it officially in
2020.<br>
Poust et al.'s measurements for manual phalanx I-1 (15.9 and 15.8 mm)
and metacarpal III (17.1, 18.7 mm) are far too short, and others listed
above may end up being off as well once checked.  Poust et al. are
incorrect in stating "the tiny first phalanges of left and right manual
digit three are missing", as shown by their own description, figures
and measurement table.  Contra Poust et al., only the right ilium
seems
to be exposed, with the supposed broken dorsal boundary exposing the
dorsal left ilium being a crack through the bone.  The authors
note
"restoration efforts by technically proficient but inexpert preparators
untrained in anatomy resulted in one noticeable error prior to the
specimen&acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s arrival at the museum: the distal pedal phalanges of the
right Digit II (2, 3, and the ungual) have been reconstructed
incorrectly."  <br>
Poust et al. (2020) entered it into Turner's TWiG analysis and
recovered it as a microraptorian sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>,
but both characters supporting this are misscored- "the lack of a
proximodorsal lip on the manual unguals (153) and a laterally inclined
flange along the dorsal edge of the surangular (212)."   Both
taxa have
a proximodorsal lip on at least manual ungual II, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span>
is too crushed to determine the presence of a surangular flange. 
Adding it to Hartman et al.'s TWiG analysis results in a most
parsimonious position sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Zhongjianosaurus</span>,
placing all of the Jiufotang microraptorians together.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- While various
websites including Wikipedia state the specimen was first reported in
2009, this is not substantiated by any sourced account and is unlikely
as specimens from the Sihedang locality were not described until 2012,
with no non-bird taxa reported until 2014.  Xu and Qin (2017)
indicate is that it must have been found prior to March 2017.  An
advanced online version was published April 10, but the official
paginated version was published by April 26 so no separate nomen nudum
entry is given here for the two week long gap.  While Xu and Qin
assigned <span style="font-style: italic;">Zhongjianosaurus</span> to

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 2000) posterior dentary teeth with
constricted bases (also in <i>Richardoestesia gilmorei</i> and <i>Paronychodon</i>;
may be plesiomorphic for Maniraptoriformes); accessory trochanter on
femur.<br>
(after Xu et al., 2003) manual phalanx III-1 &gt;83% of phalanx III-3
in length (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Wulong</span>).<br>
(after Gong et al., 2012) slender ischial shaft.<br>
(proposed) manual phalanx I-1 &lt;62% of metacarpal II in length;
tibiofemoral ratio &lt;136%; metatarsal I &lt;20% of metatarsal III in
length; pedal phalanx IV-4 &gt;65% of phalanx IV-1; highly elongate leg
remiges (&gt;1.5 times femoral length).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Xu et al. (2000) listed "mesial serrations
absent from all teeth" as an apomorphy of <i>Microraptor</i>, but
large specimen NGMC 00-12-A has mesial serrations on maxillary teeth
(Ji, 2002), so this may be size-related. Another possibility is that
NGMC 00-12-A is a different species. Xu et al. also listed mid caudal
vertebrae 3-4 times length of anterior dorsal vertebrae, but this is
also seen in NGMC 91. Another supposed apomorphy listed in the original
description is less than 26 caudal vertebrae, but several subsequently
discovered specimens have 26 or more caudals. Finally, strongly curved
pedal unguals are also seen in NGMC 91 (Senter, 2007). <br>
Contra Xu et al. (2003), the high metacarpal III/II ratio is not
diagnostic, being similar to <i>Bambiraptor</i> and matched by NGMC
91. The distal articulation of manual phalanx III-3 does not appear to
be smaller or more ventrally skewed than NGMC 91.<br>
Gong et al. (2012) listed the absence of antorbital fossa pitting in
their diagnosis, but this is plesiomorphic. Contra their diagnosis, LVH
0026 does appear to have a 'subfenestral fossa', though more anteriorly
placed than in <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. Manual phalanx III-1 is not
longer than III-3 in all specimens (e.g. IVPP V13475, CAGS 20-7-004, <i>gui</i>
holotype). The ischium is not longer compared to the pubis or femur
than in <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>. Not all <i>Microraptor</i> specimens
have bowed tibiotarsi (e.g. IVPP coll. in Turner et al., 2012; fig.
20F).<br>
Contra Turner et al. (2012), metatarsal V is not longer than other
dromaeosaurids such as <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>
in all specimens (e.g. CAGS 20-7-004 and 20-8-001) and bowing is common
in dromaeosaurids.<br>
<b>The "Archaeoraptor" debacle</b>- The holotype was discovered in
1997, though its part and counterpart slabs were quickly separated. One
slab contained the tail, which was then fraudulently combined with a
euornithine bird skeleton by a Chinese farmer. It was smuggled out of
the country then sold at the 1998 Tuscon Gem Show to Czerkas. Currie
recognized the legs were part and counterpart slabs of the same bones,
while Rowe and Aulenback independently verified the composite nature of
the specimen. National Geographic announced the specimen in a press
conference in October, and in November, Sloan (1999) published a paper
using the name "Archaeoraptor liaoningensis". This was a nomen nudum
because it explicitely stated the taxon was to be described formerly in
an official publication. That official publication was to have been in
Science or Nature, but both journals rejected it. In October, Xu had
noticed the tail of "Archaeoraptor" matched the one on the
dromaeosaurid skeleton he was describing. Xu located the body which
went with this tail by contacting fossil dealers in December. In April,
Olson (2000) published an article purporting to officially describe
"Archaeoraptor" and attach that name to the dromaeosaurid tail (with
the latter as the lectotype). Several months later in December, Xu et
al. (2000) officially named <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i> based on the
dromaeosaurid tail and associated anterior part of the skeleton Xu had
been studying. At this time, Olshevsky (DML, 2000) noted that Olson's
publication predated Xu et al.'s, and he believed that this made <i>Microraptor</i>
a junior synonym of "Archaeoraptor". Several days later, Creisler (DML,
2001) pointed out the Olson's attempt to name "Archaeoraptor" was
invalid because the ICZN requires a diagnosis in a valid publication,
while Olson merely referenced the invalid article by Sloan. Creisler
further indicated Olson cannot designate a lectotype without a valid
publication defining a holotype first. Thus "Archaeoraptor" is still a
nomen nudum, despite Olson's efforts, and <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>
is the valid name for the IVPP V 12330 dromaeosaurid. The euornithine
section (IVPP V 12444) was later described by Czerkas and Xu (2002) as
a new taxon- <i>Archaeovolans repatriates</i>, which was in turn
synonymized with <i>Yanornis martini</i> by Zhou et al. (2002).<br>
<b><i>Microraptor gui</i>, <i>Cryptovolans pauli</i> and other
specimens</b>- In 2001, IVPP 13476 was discovered, and later mentioned
by Xu et al. (2003) as <i>Microraptor sp.</i>. Four additional
specimens (IVPP V13320, V13477, V13351, V13352) were purchased by the
IVPP in 2001-2002. Xu et al. (2003) mentioned IVPP V13351 as another <i>Microraptor
sp.</i> specimen, and IVPP V13477 as Dromaeosauridae gen. et sp.
indet., but described V13352 and V13320 as the holotype and paratype of
a new species, <i>Microraptor gui</i>. This was based on several
characters supposedly distinct from the <i>M. zhaoianus</i> holotype,
which have been subsequently questioned by Senter et al. (2004) and
Turner et al. (2012). There is a prominent biceps tubercle on the
proximal radius of the <i>gui</i> holotype, which Senter et al. and
Turner et al. considered individual variation. Both papers correctly
noted the bent pubis and low ratio of metacarpal I plus manual phalanx
I-1 compared to metacarpal II (~87%) are unknown in the <i>M. zhaoianus</i>
holotype, while a curved tibiotarsus is found in that species as well
(Turner et al. considered the curvature to be taphonomic). Xu et al.
also mention the fused sterna as being different than other
dromaeosaurids, but sterna are unknown in the <i>M. zhaoianus</i>
holotype. Proportional differences have now been shown to be plausibly
allometric, due to intermediate sized <i>Microraptor</i> specimens
having intermediate ratios (possibly besides the tibiofemoral ratio;
see below). Contrary to popular perception, the famous elongated,
asymmetrical feathers attached to <i>M. gui</i>'s metatarsi and
tibiotarsi were not absent in <i>M. zhaoianus</i>, merely unpreserved
in the holotype. Thus there seems to be almost no basis for separating <i>M.
gui</i> from <i>M. zhaoianus</i>,
let alone as a separate genus "Tetrapterornis" as was suggested by
Miller (2004) based on these same characters.  The genus is a
nomen nudum as Miller always places it in quotation marks, and thus
violates ICZN Article 11.5- "a name must be used as valid for a taxon
when proposed." IVPP V13477 has the apomorphically long leg remiges of <i>Microraptor</i>,
so is here referred to that genus. TNP00996 was purchased in 2002 and
briefly described by Xu et al. (2003) as <i>Microraptor sp.</i>.
Senter (2011) has since retained <i>gui</i> as a separate OTU than <i>zhaoianus</i>,
though there are no differences between the two listed in his table S1.
O'Connor et al. (2011) described a new specimen (IVPP V17972) as <i>M.
gui</i> based on its large size relative to <i>M. zhaoianus</i>,
manual digit proportions, pubic curvature and slight bowing of the
tibia. Of these only size is new, which could easily be ontogenetic as
sutures are visible in the <i>M. zhaoianus</i> holotype sacrum.<br>
Hwang et al. (2002) described two new <i>Microraptor</i> specimens
(CAGS 20-7-004 and 20-8-001) which were collected by farmers from an
unknown locality. These were assigned to <i>M. zhaoianus</i>, as <i>M.
gui</i> had yet to be described. Although published much later, the <i>M.
gui</i> description was accepted for publication several days before
Hwang et al.'s paper was published, and Xu et al. (2003) never
reference either CAGS specimen. The presence of a biceps tubercle
cannot be determined due to preservation, and their tibiotarsi are
curved. Though metacarpal II is incomplete distally, 20-7-004 has digit
II phalanges placed in a position where the first digit could be as
comparatively short as <i>M. gui</i>. The pubic shape cannot be
determined as the bones are preserved in anterior view. Size and most
proportions (ulnofemoral, ischiofemoral and metatarsofemoral ratios)
are intermediate between <i>M. zhaoianus</i> and <i>M. gui</i>, while
the tibiofemoral ratio is more similar to <i>zhaoianus</i> (126%
compared to 128% in <i>zhaoianus</i> and 133% in <i>gui</i>). The
sternal plates of CAGS 20-8-001 are unfused, unlike the <i>M. gui</i>
holotype. Proportional differences from <i>M. gui</i> include a
smaller ulnohumeral ratio (85-87% vs. 101%), longer phalanx I-1
compared to metacarpal I (261% vs. 211%), longer manual phalanx II-2
compared to II-1 (122% vs. 103%), and longer manual phalanx III-1
compared to III-3 (99% vs. 90%). Senter (2011) viewed the CAGS
specimens as distinct from <i>zhaoianus</i> and/or <i>gui</i> based
on three characters. He claims the latter two species lack serrated
maxillary and dentary teeth, but the <i>zhaoianus</i> type has
serrations clearly described and illustrated. IVPP V13320 is indeed
unique among reported <i>Microraptor</i> specimens in lacking serrated
mid-jaw teeth, but the condition is unpreserved in the <i>gui</i>
holotype. Unfused sternal plates do indeed differ from the <i>gui</i>
holotype as noted above. Finally, as noted above, manual phalanx I-1 is
much longer compared to metacarpal I (261%) than in the <i>gui</i>
holotype (211%), but this is also true of <i>Cryptovolans</i> (252%)
and <i>hanqingi</i> (250%), though not of NGMC 00-12-A (211%) or IVPP
V13475 (209%).<br>
LPM 0200 was first briefly described as an unnamed dromaeosaurid by
Norell et al. (2002), then described further and named <i>Cryptovolans
pauli</i> by Czerkas et al. (2002) several months later. Most of the
bones in the holotype and paratype (LPM 0159) are split between slab
and counterslab, leading to very poor preservation and a lack of
anatomical detail. Norell et al. correctly described the elongate leg
remiges, which Czerkas et al. mistook for forelimb feathers. However,
Czerkas et al. were correct in describing the fused sternum and
asymmetrical remiges, contra Norell et al.. Czerkas et al. also
believed NGMC 91 to possibly be referrable to <i>Cryptovolans</i>, but
this specimen is more likely <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> (Ji et al., 2002)
or the sister taxon to <i>Microraptor</i> (Senter et al., 2004;
Senter, 2007). Most publications have ignored <i>Cryptovolans</i>,
perhaps due to the poor description, highly illogical discussion and
various personal disputes with Czerkas' publishing practices. <br>
Immediately after Xu et al.'s (2003) publication of <i>M. gui</i>,
Holtz (DML, 2003) proposed it is a junior synonym of <i>Cryptovolans
pauli</i> (using the new, unpublished combination "<i>Microraptor pauli</i>").
He noted the biceps tubercle cannot be determined as absent in the
latter, which also has a bent pubis, curved tibiotarsus and fused
sternal plates. The <i>Cryptovolans</i> paratype seems to have a
similarly short first manual digit (though poor preservation makes this
uncertain), contra Czerkas et al.'s (2002) illustration. Proportional
differences between <i>Cryptovolans</i>' paratype and <i>M. gui</i>
include a smaller ulnohumeral ratio (~92% vs. 101%) and longer manual
phalanx III-1 vs. III-3 (142% vs. 90%). The CAGS specimens are more
similar to <i>Cryptovolans</i> in the ulnohumeral ratio, and to <i>M.
gui</i> in the manual digit III phalangeal proportions. The <i>Cryptovolans</i>
specimens are more similar to the CAGS specimens than <i>M. gui</i> in
their ulnohumeral ratios, long manual phalanx I-1 compared to
metacarpal I (252%), and long manual phalanx III-1 compared to III-3,
but are more similar to <i>M. gui</i> in their shorter manual phalanx
II-2 compared to II-1 (105%).  Similarly, Miller (2004) stated
"Under my own classification, <span style="font-style: italic;">M. gui</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">C. pauli</span> would both
become <span style="font-style: italic;">'Tetrapterornis' gui</span>",
despite the fact both <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptovolans</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">pauli</span> have priority over
"Tetrapterornis" and <span style="font-style: italic;">gui</span>.<br>
Two of the only papers to mention <i>Cryptovolans</i> (Senter et al.,
2004; Senter, 2007) agree it is a junior synonym of <i>Microraptor
zhaoianus</i>. Senter et al. state the manual proportions that diagnose
<i>Cryptovolans</i> are also seen in other Chinese microraptorians.
Czerkas et al. diagnosed <i>Cryptovolans</i> by its high III-1/III-3
ratio (138-142%). If we examine the ratio in other microraptorians, <i>Microraptor</i>'s
(CAGS 20-7-004) is 98%, <i>Microraptor gui</i>'s holotype is 85%, NGMC
91's is 75%, <i>Sinornithosaurus millenii</i>'s is 76%, and <i>Graciliraptor</i>'s
is 64%. Senter et al. are however correct in noting that the <i>Microraptor
gui</i> holotype also has fused sternal plates, and that the unfused
sternal plates of another <i>Microraptor</i> specimen (CAGS-20-8-001)
might be due to ontogeny. Czerkas' final listed diagnostic character
(28-30 caudal vertebrae) is similar to <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>'
holotype (24), <i>Microraptor</i> specimens CAGS 20-7-004 and 20-8-001
(26) and <i>Microraptor gui</i>' holotype (~26). Other maniraptoriform
species (<i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>, <i>Shenzhouraptor sinensis</i>)
are known to have individual variation in caudal count within 3-4
vertebrae. Czerkas et al. also stated that the tibiofemoral ratio of
the paratype scales differently compared to <i>Microraptor</i>, which
they viewed as evidence the taxa were not synonymous. Yet the <i>Microraptor
gui</i> holotype has almost identical hindlimb size and ratio to the <i>Cryptovolans</i>
holotype, while the paratype would seem to have an unsually long femur.
It seems unlikely this is due to allometry, as <i>Microraptor</i>
shows almost no change in tibiofemoral ratio with age. More likely,
individual variation or poor preservation is the cause. Finally,
Czerkas et al. stated that <i>Cryptovolans</i> has a longer forelimb
than other dromaeosaurids (hum+rad+mcII+pII-1+pII-2 239% of femoral
length), but it is subequal or shorter in length to <i>Microraptor</i>
(237-258%), <i>Sinornithosaurus millenii</i> (252%), NGMC 91 (256%)
and <i>Bambiraptor</i> (244%). Senter (2011) reversed his opinion and
retained <i>Cryptovolans</i> as a separate OTU, where it grouped with <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
and <i>Graciliraptor</i> to the exclusion of <i>Microraptor</i>. This
was due to several characters. <i>Cryptovolans</i> has a longitudinal
labial depression depression on some teeth, but this is polymorphic in
many theropods and also found in some teeth of the <i>zhaoianus</i>
holotype and <i>M. hanqingi</i> for instance. The second character is
the supposed lack of dorsal arching (when the articular surface is held
vertically) in manual ungual I, but this is impossible to determine in
LPM 0159 due to the proximal portion of ungual being broken (LPM 0200's
hands are impossible to evaluate in Czerkas et al.'s photos), and
contra Senter is not true of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> or NGMC 91.
Senter also claims <i>Cryptovolans</i> lacks a proximodorsal lip on
manual ungual I, but not only is this variable in other taxa (e.g. <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
<i>Sapeornis</i>, <i>Confuciusornis</i>), it is an illusion in <i>Cryptovolans</i>
caused by the aforementioned broken proximal portion of that ungual.
The final character is tibiotarsal bowing, which Senter incorrectly
considered absent in <i>Microraptor</i>.<br>
Czerkas and Ji (2002) illustrate a dromaeosaurid preserved alongside
the <i>Omnivoropteryx</i> holotype, referring it tentatively to <i>Cryptovolans</i>.
Unfortunately, the illustrations are of x-rays, so little detail can be
ascertained. The ulnohumeral and metatarsotibial ratios are more
similar to <i>Microraptor</i> specimen NGMC 00-12-A, while the short
manual digit I is more similar to <i>Microraptor</i> than <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
so it is provisionally retained in the former genus until it is
described in more detail.<br>
Ji (2002) described a dromaeosaurid (NGMC 00-12-A) found in 2000 as <i>Sinornithosaurus
sp.</i>. This was based on several characters, which are all found in
other microraptorians. The unserrated premaxillary teeth, posteriorly
bifurcated dentary, prominent obturator process and
subarctometatarsalian metatarsus are also present in <i>Microraptor</i>,
the U shaped furcula is present in all microraptorians, while the
extremely short manual phalanx III-2 relative to III-1 is even more
similar to <i>Microraptor </i>than<i> Sinornithosaurus</i>. The
ischium is more similar to <i>Microraptor</i> than <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
in being slender shafted with a more proximally placed distodorsal
process, and the maxillary teeth are more like <i>Microraptor</i> in
being mesially unserrated. NGMC 00-12-A seems to lack a pronounced
biceps tubercle, but has a short first manual digit, bent pubis and
curved tibiotarsus. Unlike <i>Microraptor gui</i> and the holotype and
paratype of <i>Cryptovolans</i>, NGMC 00-12-A lacks a fused sternum
(though it is the largest well described specimen). In a few
proportions, NGMC 00-12-A is more similar to <i>M. gui</i> than <i>Cryptovolans
pauli</i>, including the small sternum (53% of femoral length vs. 49%
in <i>gui</i> and 60% in <i>pauli</i>), though in others it is more
similar to <i>C. pauli</i>. The latter include the (originally
supposed to be apomorphic for <i>Cryptovolans</i>) ratio between
manual phalanx III-1 and III-3 (139% vs. 142% in <i>pauli</i> and 90%
in <i>gui</i>). NGMC 00-12-A is more similar to the CAGS specimens
than <i>M. gui</i> in its ulnohumeral ratio (89%) and manual phalanx
III-1 compared to III-3, but more similar to <i>M. gui</i> in its
short manual phalanx I-1 compared to metacarpal I (208%), and short
manual phalanx II-2 compared to II-1 (101%). There are a few
differences from smaller <i>Microraptor</i> specimens- more slender
dentary, posterior dentary teeth serrated mesially, and taller
posterior dorsal neural spines (last dorsal neural spine 72% taller
than centrum compared to 63% in CAGS 20-8-001), longer pubofemoral
ratio (86% vs. 71-77%), and shorter pedal phalanx III-2 vs. III-1 (59%
vs. 78-83%). These are possibly due to age.<br>
Zhang (2007) proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>
"zhaoi" for QM V1002 with a short description that claimed to
distinguish it from <span style="font-style: italic;">S. millenii</span>
based on teeh that are thick and less sharp, and longer
arms.   However, its humerofemoral ratio (~86%) is actually
shorter than the <span style="font-style: italic;">S. millenii</span>
holotype (~91%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
teeth are typically less elongate than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>'.  The
slender ischium, short tibia, elongate pedal phalanx IV-4 and long leg
remiges all support assigning QM V1002 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>, and Xing et al.
(2013) described it as a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">M.
gui</span>.  This was based on the biceps tubercle, short manual
digit I, bent pubis, and a new character- manual ungual I shorter to be
subequal in size to ungual II. The holotype of <i>M. zhaoianus</i>
doesn't preserve manual unguals, and this is seemingly based on CAGS
20-8-001 which has been referred to that species without basis. This is
the only <i>Microraptor</i> specimen with such a large ungual I
compared to II, which is probably due to supposed ungual II belonging
to digit III instead. Both unguals are disarticulated and the only ones
preserved in that specimen. Notably, the sterna are unfused despite
being from an individual 12% larger than the <i>M. gui</i>
holotype.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>
"zhaoi" is a nomen nudum as there is no "explicit fixation of a
holotype, or syntypes" (ICZN Article 16.4.1), with photos of the skull
and pes merely captioned "One skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus zhaoi</span> (sp.nov.)"
and "One claw of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinorni thosaurus</span>
[sic] <span style="font-style: italic;">zhaoi</span> (sp.nov.)"
respectively and no mention of its catalog number.<br>
Alexander et al. (2010) used LVH 0026 for their biomechanical work,
considering it "probably a different species of <i>Microraptor</i> but
is morphologically closely similar to <i>M. gui</i>, including the
presence of flight-adapted feathers on the tarsometatarsus" (though
remember <i>M. zhaoianus</i>' holotype merely doesn't preserve
metatarsal remiges, and may have had them in life). Gong et al. (2012)
later described it as the new species <i>Microraptor hanqingi</i>.
They diagnosed it based on several characters. The larger size (11-14%
larger than <i>M. gui</i> or <i>Cryptovolans</i>) could be
ontogenetic or individual variation. Unfused sternals are also present
in CAGS 20-80-001 and NGMC 00-12-A. The pubis is not more robust than
in <i>M. gui</i>, and it cannot be determined if the pubic boot is
more squared since most of <i>M. gui</i>'s is hidden behind the
tibiotarsus. The pubis is indeed bent ~10 degrees less than in the <i>M.
gui</i> holotype, but some other specimens lack much bending at all
(e.g. IVPP V13475). Contra Gong et al., the ischia of <i>M. hanqingi</i>
are posteriorly sinuous and those of <i>M. gui</i> are anteriorly
concave, so do not differ in these respects. Additionally, the short
manual digit I was said to be like <i>M. gui</i> but unlike <i>M.
zhaoianus</i>, and this is true for a referred <i>M. zhaoianus</i>
IVPP V13475 and the <i>Cryptovolans</i> paratype, while NGMC 00-12-A
is also like <i>M. hanqingi</i> and <i>M. gui</i>. Yet these ratios
do not correspond to other skeletal differences as noted in the
taxonomy conclusion below. The supposedly longer metatarsal II compared
to IV was also supposed to be more similar to <i>M. gui</i> than to <i>M.
zhaoianus</i>, but the latter's holotype has a ratio of 98% compared to
91% in <i>M. gui</i>'s holotype. In addition, other <i>Microraptor</i>
specimens fall between those two ratios, and 7% differences or more are
known in other coelurosaurs (e.g. <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>
and <i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i>). Finally, its 23 caudal
vertebrae were said to be less than <i>M. gui</i>'s ~26, but as noted
in <i>Cryptovolans</i>' discussion other <i>Microraptor</i> specimens
fall between these measures and such variation is known in other
species. Pei et al. (2014) agree <i>M. hanqingi</i> is a junior
synonym of <i>M. zhaoianus</i>.<br>
In conclusion, the problem with splitting the <i>Microraptor</i>-<i>Cryptovolans</i>
clade into species is not the absence of variation, as most of the
described specimens have some proportions or characters which differ
from all or most other specimens. Instead, the problem is that these
differences don't vary in a systematic, congruent way. While we might
argue the <i>Cryptovolans</i> specimens and <i>M. gui</i> holotype
should be grouped together to the exclusion of <i>M. hanqingi</i>,
CAGS 20-80-001, NGMC 00-12-A and QM V1002 based on their fused sterna,
we could equally as well argue the <i>Cryptovolans</i> specimens, <i>M.
hanqingi</i> and NGMC 00-12-A should be grouped together to the
exclusion of the <i>M. gui</i> holotype and CAGS 20-7-004 based on
their long manual phalanx III-1. Or that <i>Cryptovolans</i>, <i>M.
hanqingi</i> and CAGS 20-7-004 should be grouped together to the
exclusion of the <i>M. gui</i> holotype, NGMC 00-12-A and QM V1002
based on their long manual phalanx I-1. There is no obvious answer. One
possibility would be to diagnose a separate species for each specimen,
and indeed the variation may be due to several different species living
in the Jiufotang fauna. This approach has since been taken by Senter
(2011), who views <i>M. zhaoianus</i>, <i>M. gui</i>, the CAGS
specimens and <i>Cryptovolans</i> <i>pauli</i> as separate species,
with the latter closer to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> and <i>Graciliraptor</i>.
The more conservative approach taken by Senter et al. (2004) and Turner
et al. (2012) is followed here, where differences are ascribed to
individual and ontogenetic variation. Further description of the
specimens mentioned by Xu et al. (2003) and others will help confirm or
deny this view. <br>
Maranga et al. (2020) preliminarily describe a new skull (JLUM
Y-MR160501) from Sihedang they call <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
sp., notable for having "denticles on both the mesial and distal
carinae of the posterior dentary teeth, a characteristic that has never
been observed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
to date."  However as noted above this is also present in NGMC
00-12-A.  Oddly they recover the specimen sister to Microraptoria
plus eudromaeosaurs using Currie's dromaeosaurid analysis.<br>
A number of undescribed specimens appear to belong to <i>Microraptor</i>
as defined here. One on the Paleowonders website is particularily
complete, preserving faint remiges. It was advertised as <i>Microraptor
gui</i> at a fossil show. The manual phalanx I-1 length suggests it is
in fact <i>Microraptor</i>. One photo of the specimen seems more
simplified, lacks an ilium, and has contaur feather impressions. It may
be a cast. The specimen appears to preserve rather thick, elongate
bones in the pelvic and thoracic areas which are near certainly from
another animal.<br>
Another specimen is shown at the Hong Kong Science Museum's "Soaring
Dinosaurs" exhibit, advertised as <i>Microraptor gui</i>. This
specimen is largely complete, but strangely positioned, with the
presacral column sharply curved backward and the hindlimbs extending
anteriorly. The elongate leg remiges confirm the identification as <i>Microraptor</i>.<br>
Yet another specimen is complete and perfectly articulated,
photographed on Fossil Mall's website as Dromaeosauridae <i>cf.
Sinornithosaurus</i>. Its manual phalanx III-3 is elongate like <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
yet its tibiofemoral ratio and manual phalanx I-1 are short as in <i>Microraptor</i>.
It is tentaively referred to <i>Microraptor</i> here.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- (MOR 553S-7-30-91-274) maxilla (~94 mm) (Currie and
Varricchio, 2004)<br>
<b> Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1993 and initially
believed to be <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, then reported as <i>Velociraptor
sp.</i> (Burnham et al., 1997). Buchholz (DML 1997) used the name
"Linsterosaurus" for this taxon on the Dinosaur Mailing List between
1997 and 2000, while the Oxford Museum of Natural History labeled their
cast of the specimen <i>Velociraptor feinbergi</i> (Taylor, DML 2003).
Neither of these names have been published however. It was later
described as a new taxon of dromaeosaurid (Burnham et al., 2000),
though some believe it should be synonymized with <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.
However, Hohman and Varricchio (2021) described juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> maxilla MOR 9753
which is smaller than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>
holotype, but shares characters with adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> maxillae. 
Similarly, they find larger maxilla MOR 553S-7-30-91-274 groups with <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span> in Currie and
Varracchio's dromaeosaurid analysis and differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>.  Thus the
taxa are unlikely to be synonymous.  Olshevsky (DML, 2000) noted <i>Bambiraptor
feinbergi</i> was named after multiple people, so suggested it be
emended to <i>B. feinbergorum</i>, which is followed on several
websites and publications. However, the Fourth Edition of the ICZN no
longer requires emendations based on this reasoning (Article 31.1.3),
as Creisler pointed out later that day (DML, 2000). Norell and
Makovicky (2004) first published the name <i>Bambiraptor feinbergorum</i>,
which according to ICZN Article 32.2.3 is an available name with its
own authorship, though an objective junior synonym of <i>B. feinbergi</i>.<br>
Currie and Evans (2020) identified the first and second premaxillary
teeth, the latter of which is catalogd as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Paronychodon</span>?" due to the ridges
also found in <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
('<span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>') teeth.  <br>
Longrich and Currie (2009) found <i>Bambiraptor</i> to be a
saurornitholestiine in their analysis, and Brusatte et al. (2014) found
the genera to be sister taxa within Velociraptorinae. Foth et al.
(2014) and Senter et al. (2012) have both found <i>Bambiraptor</i> to
be outside the Velociraptorinae+Dromaeosaurinae clade, though neither
included <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) sacral centra three and four transversely
compressed (transverse width &lt;60% of first sacral centrum).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Le Loeuff et al. (1992) described a femur (MDE-D203)
from Metisson (Fox-Amphoux, Var), and an anterior dorsal vertebra
(MDE-D01), posterior sacral vertebra (MDE coll.) and several
fragmentary dorsal ribs from Roques-Hautes (Bouches-du-Rhone). They
believed these were congeneric or at least related to <i>Elopteryx</i>,
most closely related to dromaeosaurids, though perhaps deserving their
own family or subfamily (Elopterygidae or Elopteryginae). The femur was
only stated to share general characteristics with <i>Elopteryx</i>
(reduced fourth trochanter, posterior trochanter, "shape and size")
while differing in having a linear capital ligament fossa and absent
fourth trochanter. The other remains are not comparable to <i>Elopteryx</i>.
It is here tentatively assigned to <i>Variraptor</i> as it is from the
type locality.<br>
Buffetaut et al. (1997) first mention the sacrum (MDE-D169) and humerus
(MDE-D158) from Bastide Neuve (Fox-Amphoux, Var) as a new taxon of
dromaeosaurid. Le Loeuf and Buffetaut (1998) described and named this
taxon <i>Variraptor</i>, with the sacrum and an articulated dorsal
vertebra as the holotype. They referred the anterior dorsal and
posterior sacral described by Le Loeuff et al. (1992), as well as a
femur (MDE-D49) and the aforementioned humerus. The fifth sacral was
said to be identical to that of the holotype, though the other remains
are not comparable. The femur was not mentioned further, and seems to
be a cast of MDE-D203.<br>
Buffetaut et al. (1999) first mentioned teeth (MC-M324, M561 and M938)
and a femur (MC-M187) from Massecaps (Cruzy, Herualt) and referred it
to <i>Variraptor</i>. Chanthasit and Buffetaut (2009) later described
this material, as well as a partial manual ungual (MC coll.) and pedal
ungual (MC-M228) from the same locality. Chanthasit and Buffetaut also
described two teeth (MC-VC1 and VC2) from Combebelle and a sacrum
(MC-PSP6) from Plo Saint Pons, both also in Cruzy. Finally, they
describe five teeth (CM-186, 218, 307, 537 and 684), an ulna (CM-307)
and an ilium (CM-645) from Bastide Neuve. They noted the ilium matches
the holotype sacrum exactly, so probably belongs to the same
individual, while the sacrum has <i>Variraptor</i>'s apomorphic
proportions. Unfortunately, the femur was not compared to MDE-D203, but
the ulna does differ from <i>Pyroraptor</i> in lacking a deep brachial
fossa. Chanthasit and Buffetaut do not refer most of their material to
a particular genus, though it is all provisionally referred to <i>Variraptor</i>
here, given its presence in Bastide Neuve, Roques-Hautes and Plo Saint
Pons. <br>
Allain and Taquet (2000) correctly noted no diagnostic dorsal or sacral
characters were described by Le Loeuff and Buffetaut, so they
considered <i>Variraptor</i> a nomen dubium. Yet as noted by
Chanthasit and Buffetaut, <i>Variraptor</i> does differ from all other
comparable dromaeosaurids. The presence of posterior dorsal pleurocoels
distinguishes it from <i>Microraptor</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>,
while it has one less pair of dorsal pleurocoels than <i>Achillobator</i>.
The pleurocoels are smaller than in <i>Deinonychus</i> however. The
dorsal vertebra is anteroposteriorly compressed, unlike
microraptorians. Indeed, the compression is a dromaeosaurine
synapomorphy (Senter, 2007). <i>Variraptor</i> has less sacrals than <i>Deinonychus</i>,
<i>Ornithodesmus</i> and unenlagiines, and its sacrum is not dorsally
arched like those of <i>Saurornitholestes</i> and <i>Ornithodesmus</i>.
<i>Variraptor</i> differs from <i>Microraptor</i>, <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
<i>Saurornitholestes</i>, <i>Ornithodesmus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>
in having highly compressed mid sacral centra. It may be a synonym of <i>Pyroraptor</i>,
but it would be a senior synonym if so. The newly described ilium will
probably provide further diagnostic characters.<br>
Rauhut (2000) refers <i>Variraptor</i> to Coelurosauria indet. since
some <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens and perhaps juvenile individuals
of other maniraptoriform clades have five sacral vertebrae, while he
finds the rectangular posterior central face of the last sacral (and
presumably proximal caudals) to be potentially present in other
maniraptorans. Indeed, basal members of Therizinosauria,
Oviraptorosauria and Troodontidae all have five sacral vertebrae as
well. Also, most non-pygostylian maniraptorans have rectangular
proximal caudal centra. Yet troodontids and basal oviraptorosaurs lack
posterior dorsal and sacral pleurocoels, and the high degree of fusion
in <i>Variraptor</i> suggests it was not a juvenile. The only
non-dromaeosaurid taxon with five sacral vertebrae, pleurocoelous
posterior dorsals and anterior sacrals, and rectangular proximal caudal
vertebrae is <i>Falcarius</i>. <i>Variraptor</i> is more similar to
dromaeosaurids in having a hyposphene separated by the posterior
ligament groove, and shorter dorsal centra. <br>
Rauhut further suggested the paratype anterior dorsal vertebra is a
caenagnathid, based on resemblence to <i>Chirostenotes</i>, especially
in having two pairs of pleurocoels. Yet <i>Achillobator</i> and <i>Utahraptor</i>
both also have two pairs of pleurocoels in some dorsals, and <i>Variraptor</i>
resembles <i>Deinonychus</i> more than <i>Chirostenotes</i> in having
a longer infraprezygopophyseal fossa, more poorly developed
inradiapophyseal fossa, anteroposteriorly narrower neural spine, and
basally restricted posterior interspinous ligament groove. The
prominent epipophyses also suggest anterior cervical epipophyses would
be well developed, as in dromaeosaurids but not oviraptorosaurs.
Rauhut's hypothesis is unsupported, and <i>Variraptor</i> is not
demonstrably a chimaera.<br>
Senter et al. (2004) included <i>Variraptor</i> in a phylogenetic
analysis and found only that it was a coelurosaur closer to birds than
tyrannosauroids, and not a Jehol microraptorian or member of the <i>Achillobator</i>+<i>Utahraptor</i>+<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
clade. However, their analysis lacked many relevent characters (precise
sacral number; sacral pleurocoel presence; posterior dorsal pleurocoel
presence; proximal caudal centrum shape; etc.), so this result is
meaningless.<br>
Hartman et al. (2019) recover the taxon sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>,
while Longrich et al. (2021) suggest several characters are shared with
unenlagiines ("enlarged cuppedicus fossa, arched dorsal margin of the
ilium and deep anterior blade, short posterior blade, concave
posterodorsal margin of the blade, and a brevis fossa that is reduced
anteriorly").<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1887 and described by
Marsh (1888) as a new species of <i>Coelurus</i>.
In addition to the manual ungual, he referenced metatarsals which were
not necessarily based on real specimens. Lull (1911) recognized the
ungual as pertaining to digit III and referred three teeth. USNM 8444
and 8445 were found in 1895 (USNM online).  One tooth is said to
lack mesial serrations while another has extremely small mesial
serrations which are restricted apically. Gilmore (1920) noted four
unguals from the Belly River Group of Canada at the AMNH (including
AMNH 5387) were nearly identical to the holotype. Matthew and Brown
(1922) provisionally referred the taxon to their new genus <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
as (?)<i>Dromaeosaurus gracilis</i>. This was done without
justification. Gilmore (1924) believed the AMNH unguals belonged to <i>Chirostenotes</i>,
and stated <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus gracilis</span>
"should now be removed to this genus" but didn't explicitly use the
combination <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes gracilis</span>.
Ostrom (1969) notes a strong resemblence of the holotype to the first
manual ungual of <i>Deinonychus</i>, but considered it indeterminate.
Lipka (1998) reported recovering teeth similar to those described by
Lull, which remain undescribed. He noted <i>Coelurus gracilis</i> may
relate to the Arundel <i>Deinonychus</i>-like teeth he described.<br>
The extremely large flexor tubercle and proximodorsal lip suggest the
ungual is from digit III as suggested by Lull, contra Ostrom. The
holotype ungual differs from <i>Chirostenotes</i> in being more
curved, having a smaller proximodorsal lip, more proximally placed
flexor tubercle and a proximally undivided longitudinal groove. <i>Microvenator</i>'s
unguals resemble <i>Chirostenotes</i> in being less curved with more
distally placed flexor tubercles. <i>Hagryphus</i> is more similar in
being more strongly curved with a more proximally placed flexor
tubercle than <i>Chirostenotes</i>, but still has a divided groove and
larger proximodorsal lip. These oviraptorosaurs also all have lower
flexor tubercles than USNM 4973. Among oviraptorids, only <i>Citipati</i>
is similar in having strongly curved third manual unguals with a
proximodorsal lip, but differs in having a lower flexor tubercle. This
also seems to be the case for <i>Yixianosaurus</i> and <i>Tanycolagreus</i>.
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Confuciusornis</i> unguals are more
slender and less curved with much lower flexor tubercles. This leaves
dromaeosaurids, among which microraptorians and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
seem less similar than derived taxa like <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>
in having lower flexor tubercles. This suggests USNM 4973 is a derived
dromaeosaurid, perhaps a synonym of <i>Deinonychus</i> based on its
provenence. Thus Matthew and Brown's generic assignment is more
accurate than Marsh's, and is followed here. It should be noted that
based on its early age, USNM 4973 is near certainly not <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
however. The unguals mentioned by Gilmore are presumably also
dromaeosaurid, perhaps belonging to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> and/or <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>.
Lull's and Lipka's referred teeth may also be dromaeosaurid, though
basal coelurosaurs may also lack mesial serrations. More information is
needed.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype was
collected in 2004 and described in an online Journal Pre-proof on
December 17 2021 by
Longrich et al. (2021).  As the paper has no mention of ZooBank,
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work
must "be registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Vectiraptor greeni" Longrich et
al., 2021 was a nomen nudum that became valid in the June
2022 issue.  <br>
Longrich et al. proposed "affinities with Eudromaeosauria,
perhaps as a primitive member of the group or sister to it" based on
broad interspinous ligament scars that differ from <span style="font-style: italic;">Unenlagia</span>,
and three characters shared with that genus and Eudromaeosauria (short
dorsal centra, posterior dorsal pleurocoels, tall and anteroposteriorly
narrow dorsal neural spines).  Based on this, they suggested
several
teeth from the Wessex Formation (IWCMS 2002.1, 3, 4 and NHMUK R 16510)
may be referrable as they are the correct size, although the
cooccurance of dromaeosaurid species in other formations makes this
speculative.  Adding it to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph
matrix
results in it being a velociraptorine sister taxon to IGM 100/22-23.<br>

epipophyses of cervical vertebrae above postzygapophyseal facets;
anterior dorsal vertebrae with hypapophyses and without pneumatopores;
anterior faces of centra of proximal caudal vertebrae round; caudal
prezygapophyses elongated distal to transition point, but not over the
length of a centrum; pubis without pubic tubercle.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2005 and initially
mentioned by Senter et al. (2010). The latter noted a lacrimal, radius
and ilium among the material, which were not in the final description.
They state the pubis has a marked pubic tubercle, unlike the holotype.
This indicates Senter et al. included UMNH VP 21751 and 21752 in the
hypodigm, though they later (2012) described these as a velociraptorine
instead. As the supposed lacrimal was stated to lack an anterodorsal
process, it's possible this ended up being the holotype proximal pubis.
The identity of the supposed ilium is unknown. Senter et al. (2012)
found <i>Yurgovuchia</i> to be a dromaeosaurine more derived than <i>Deinonychus</i>
in their analysis, using a modified form of Senter's TWiG-based matrix.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This was originally referred to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>
(Gangloff, 1998), and later to <i>Dromaeosaurus albertensis</i>
(Fiorillo and Gangloff, 2000) based on strong lateral compression and a
lack of blood grooves. However, it seems to early to belong to <i>D.

<b>Comments</b>- These teeth are moderately to strongly recurved, and
some have a very slight basal constriction. Most specimens have bot
mesial and distal serrations, with the mesial serrations restricted
apically. Some have a reduced number of distal serrations, and only
weakly developed mesial serrations. One lacks serrations entirely. The

two teeth (Dyke and Malakhov, 2004)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- ZIN PH 27/49 - 31/49 have FABLs between 9.1 and 16.7
mm, BW/FABLs of .54-.86, lingually shifted mesial carinae, 14 mesial
serrations per 5 mm and 15-17 distal serrations per 5 mm. Those
described by Dyke and Malakhov (2004) as dromaeosaurids were said to be
similar. They are probably the same specimens that were mentioned as
dromaeosaurids by Nessov and Khisorova (1988) and Nessov (1995).
Averianov (2007) noted they had low DSDIs for dromaeosaurids and
considered the possibility they are anterior maxillary/dentary teeth
from juvenile tyrannosauroids.<br>
ZIN PH 33/49 has a BW/FABL of .48, a lingually displaced mesial carina
which may have originally had small serrations, 6 distal serrations per
mm, wrinkled enamel and two vertical ridges lingually. Averianov
referred it to Dromaeosauridae based on its small serrations, and to
Dromaeosaurinae based on its relative thickness and lingually displaced
mesial carina. He viewed <i>Paronychodon</i> as juvenile dromaeosaurid
teeth, with this specimen as an intemediate age.<br>

describes the specimen in more detail using CT scanning.<br>
Baszio (1997) noted Horseshoe Canyon teeth he referred to <i>Saurornitholestes
sp.</i> differ from Dinosaur Park specimens in being smaller with less
variable serration shape. Ryan et al. (1997) listed seven teeth from
this formation as <i>Saurornitholestes sp.</i>. Ryan et al. (2000)
later described these teeth as cf. <i>Saurornitholestes sp.</i>, as
they noted the then unnamed <i>Atrociraptor</i> had teeth nearly
identical to <i>Saurornitholestes</i>'. Larson and Currie (2013) found
that <i>Atrociraptor</i> teeth only partially overlapped <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
teeth in morphometric analyses. These teeth are all provisionally
referred to <i>Atrociraptor</i> here, as no definite <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
specimens have been found in this formation. Eberth and Currie (2010)
refer three manual elements to <i>Atrociraptor</i>, but these cannot
be compared to the type material and may belong to the dromaeosaurine
or <i>Richardoestesia</i> also present in the bonebed, if not the
troodontids.<br>
RTMP 1009 was figured by Baszio as a <i>Richardoestesia</i> <i>Paronychodon</i>-like
tooth. It has three faint ridges, is moderately recurved, and has a
high DSDI (10 mesial serrations per mm vs. 5.7 distal serrations per
mm). Distal serrations are taller than apicobasally wide and rounded,
while mesial serrations are shorter than wide. Though the ridges and
distal serration shape are similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
premaxillary teeth, it differs in the curvature, fewer and weaker
ridges, small serrations, and high DSDI. The basal constriction,
serration size, DSDI and curvature are similar to <i>Richardoestesia
gilmorei</i>,
but the ridges and serration shape differ.  It may be a posterior
premaxillary tooth, which have fewer and weaker grooves than anterior
teeth in <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>. 
However, Currie and Evans (2020) find in the holotype's second
premaxillary tooth "there do not appear to be any apicobasal
longitudinal ridges and flutes. This could be a function of wear and/or
poor preservation, however."  Whether this means <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Atrociraptor</span> coexisted in the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation, <span style="font-style: italic;">Atrociraptor</span>
exhibited variation in dental ridges, or taphonomy is responsible is
uncertain.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Currie and Evans, 2020) relatively short skull (skull/femur
length ratio less than 1.0); large maxillary fenestra that is
positioned near the dorsal margin of the antorbital fossa; maxillary
sinuses that interconnect with those inside the nasal and lacrimal;
enlarged second premaxillary tooth has a flat lingual surface and has
longitudinal ridges and grooves on both labial and lingual surfaces.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Unfortunately, besides the original description of the
fragmentary holotype (Sues, 1978), Currie et al.'s (1990) description
of teeth (see also Sankey et al., 2002), Makovicky's (1995) as yet
unpublished description of vertebrae, and very recent cranial
description of Currie and Evans (2020), <i>Saurornitholestes</i> has
not received a detailed description and much information must be pieced
together from sporadic references throughout the literature. Currie and
Varricchio (2004) note both RTMP 88.121.39 and MOR 660 are being
studied by them, which had been occurring for over a decade as of that
date. <br>
<i>Saurornitholestes</i> was historically assigned to Velociraptorinae,
but was recently given its own subfamily outside the
Velociraptorinae+Dromaeosaurinae clade (Longrich and Currie, 2009;
Currie and Evans, 2020). Brusatte et al. (2014) still recovered it in
Velociraptorinae however, and here it is placed in Dromaeosaurinae
based on Hartman et al. (2019).<br>
<i><b>Laelaps explanatus</b></i>- Cope (1876a) described this tooth as
a new species of <i>Laelaps</i> (in which he placed all Judithian
theropods). Once Marsh provided the replacement name <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
for the preoccupied <i>Laelaps</i>, Hay (1902) moved <i>explanatus</i>
to that genus. Lambe (1902) meanwhile referred it to <i>Deinodon</i>,
while Hatcher referred it to <i>Aublysodon</i>, both contemporary
tyrannosaurids. Matthew and Brown (1922) questionably referred the
species to their new genus <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> as <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>(?)<i>
sp.</i>, probably based on size, for it was the smallest of their
'deinodontids'. Kuhn (1939) formalized this as <i>D. explanatus</i>.
Ostrom (1969) noted these have a high DSDI, and assigned the species to
Dromaeosauridae. Olshevsky's (1995) referral of the species to <i>Paronychodon</i>
is almost certainly incorrect, as it is serrated and lacks grooves. <br>
Of Judith River theropods, only <i>Saurornitholestes</i> and <i>Richardoestesia</i>
have a comparable DSDI. However, <i>Richardoestesia</i> is smaller
(FABL up to 4.7 vs. 6.6 mm) and has more serrations per mm (6+ vs.
4.5). The compression (BW/FABL = 2.8/6.6 mm = .42) is comparable to <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
and while the measured tooth is lower than most sampled by Sankey et
al. (2002), it is still within the range of variation (lower 5%). The
short mesial carina, which is only serrated apically, is also common in
dromaeosaurids and differs from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> in lacking a
lingual twist. As <i>Saurornitholestes langstoni</i> is common in the
equivalent Dinosaur Park Formation further north, <i>explanatus</i> is
here referred to that species. It should be noted that the name <i>explanatus</i>
has over a century of priority over <i>langstoni</i> though, so would
technically have precedence as a senior synonym. This is not followed
here because from the limited description, <i>explanatus</i> is
indistinguishable from not only <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, but <i>Bambiraptor</i>
and <i>Velociraptor</i> as well. It is only referred to <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
due to provenance.<br>
Lambe (1902) referred another tooth to this species, from the Belly
River Group of Alberta. It is also said to have a high DSDI and seems
to be <i>Saurornitholestes</i> as well. It has a FABL of 6 mm and a BW
of 3 mm.<br>
<i><b>Laelaps laevifrons</b></i>- Cope (1876b) described this tooth as
a new species of <i>Laelaps</i> (in which he placed all Judithian
theropods). Once Marsh provided the replacement name <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
for the preoccupied <i>Laelaps</i>, Hay (1902) moved <i>laevifrons</i>
to that genus. Osborn (1902) meanwhile referred it to <i>Deinodon</i>.
Matthew and Brown (1922) referred the species to their new genus <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
probably based on size, for it was the smallest of their
'deinodontids'. <br>
Of Judith River theropod taxa, <i>Zapsalis</i> and <i>Paronychodon</i>
can be eliminated due to the lack of grooves, while <i>Richardoestesia</i>
can be eliminated due to the low serration count and troodontids due to
the high serration count. This leaves tyrannosaurids, <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> as potential candidates. Tooth size is
within the range of juvenile tyrannosaurids, in the upper 10% of <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
and the upper 1% of <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. The lack of mesial
serrations is known in <i>Saurornitholestes</i> and juvenile
tyrannosaurids, but not <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. Crown compression (BW of
4 mm and FABL of 7 mm) is comparable to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> and
tyrannosaurids when size is taken into account, though hypothetically
possible for a <i>Saurornitholestes</i> that size. Crown elongation is
similar to all three taxa when compared to FABL. Crown elongation vs.
crown compression is however withion the range of <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, but not tyrannosaurids (which usually have
stouter crowns when they are that thick). The serration density (5/mm)
compared to crown compression is comparable to tyrannosaurids, and in
the outer range of <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.
Serration density compared to crown elongation is comparable to <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
and outside either <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> or tyrannosaurids. When all
components are analyzed together, <i>laevifrons</i> falls out within <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.
It is here viewed as a particularily large example of that genus. As <i>Saurornitholestes
langstoni</i> is common in the equivalent Dinosaur Park Formation
further north, <i>laevifrons</i> is here referred to that species. It
should be noted that the name <i>laevifrons</i> has over a century of
priority over <i>langstoni</i> though, so would technically have
precedence as a senior synonym (though <i>explanatus</i> has even more
priority). This is not followed here because from the limited
description, <i>laevifrons</i> is indistinguishable from not only <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
but <i>Bambiraptor</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> as well. It is only
referred to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> due to provenance.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>-
The holotype of <i>Zapsalis abradens</i> (AMNH 3953) is a tooth which
is flat lingually, with no mesial serrations and 3 distal serrations
per mm (Cope, 1876b). There are three lingual ridges and four labial
ones. The length is 12 mm, the FABL 6.5 mm, and the BW 3 mm. It was
synonymized with <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i> by Estes (1964) based
on its flat lingual side and ridges, which was followed in the
literature for decades.  Currie et al. (1990) later restricted <i>Paronychodon</i>
to the unserrated forms, and believed the serrated ones were growth
abnormalities of named genera- <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
and <i>Troodon</i>. Baszio (1997) included these in his <i>Paronychodon</i>
discussion, referred to them as <i>Paronychodon</i>-like teeth. Sankey
et al. (2002) separated the <i>Paronychodon</i>-like teeth with <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>-like
and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>-like serrations as ?<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
morphotype A. In addition to their ridges and flat lingual side, they
differ from <i>Dromaeosaurus albertensis</i> in being shorter and
labiolingually narrower, and having a straight distal edge. They argued
complete <i>D. albertensis</i> tooth rows are known, so the morphology
of morphotype A teeth is not due to positional variation. Furthermore,
they have a different stratigraphic distribution than <i>D. albertensis</i>,
being present in the Late Maastrichtian unlike the latter species. In
2007, Mortimer (DML, 2007) noticed that <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span> matched ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
morphotype A, although which kind of dromaeosaurid it was was still a
mystery.  The question was solved by the description of a complete
<span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes langstoni</span>
skull UALVP 55700 (Currie and Evans, 2020) which featured a tooth
nearly identical to <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>'
holotype in the second premaxillary position.  Its other
premaxillary teeth are also ridged, showing <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span> consists of premaxillary
teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> or
closely related taxa.  Currie and Evans proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>' holotype differed from <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes langstoni</span>
(RTMP 79.15.3 and UALVP 55700 at least) in lacking mesial serrations
(seemingly not taphonomic) and being concave apicodistally, and thus
"recommended that the two genera be kept separate."  Given the
large amount of dental variation within theropod species and
correlation between their formations, this seems flimsy unless more
Judith River teeth are discovered that share those characters with AMNH
3953.  Indeed, Baszio figures two Dinosaur Park teeth with convex
apicodistal margins and no mesial serrations (RTMP 87.36.383, RTMP
coll.), blending the morphotypes.  It would also lead to such a
narrow concept of <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
that even the Two Medicine material couldn't justifiably be
referred.  One motivation for keeping the genera separate is the
obvious priority <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis abradens</span>
has over <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes langstoni</span>,
and unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">explanatus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">laevifrons</span>, it can be distinguished
from all other named taxa (even <span style="font-style: italic;">Atrociraptor</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>).  Yet
it does not seem distinguishable from '<span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>'
teeth from the later Scollard and Lance Formations (Baszio, 1997: pl.
VI, fig. 87, 88), suggesting <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>'
holotype is indeterminate at the species level.  While one could
argue for a genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>
containing indeterminate <span style="font-style: italic;">Z. abradens</span>,
and diagnostic '<span style="font-style: italic;">Z.langstoni</span>'
and '<span style="font-style: italic;">Z. sullivani</span>', a petition
to the ICZN to suppress <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis
abradens</span> would cause far less disruption.<br>
<b>Early finds</b>- Colbert and Russell (1969) tentatively referred a
fourth metatarsal (as CMN 12072) and a pedal ungual II (CMN 12240) to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
as did Ostrom (1969) for the latter element. Paul (1988) referred the
ungual to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> instead, as he hypothesized <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
to have a reduced ungual as in <i>Adasaurus</i>. Both elements were
referred to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> by Currie (1995), but as those
bones remain undescribed for known <i>Saurornitholestes</i> specimens
(and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> may not be closer to <i>Adasaurus</i>),
such referrals are only provisional. The CMN online catalog lists 12072
as a cast of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
holotype, but 12071 as a real <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
fossil, so 12072 may have been a typo.<br>
Russell (1969) listed CMN 12343, 12354 (both found in 1968) and UA 5283
as frontals different from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, <i>Troodon</i> and a
therizinosaur frontal (CMN 12355), but these were later made paratypes
of <i>Saurornitholestes</i> when that genus was described.<br>
Sahni (1972) identified AMNH 8518 as <i>Troodon</i>, but the large
DSDI matches <i>Saurornitholestes</i> better. Howse and Milner (1993)
identified NHMUK R4463 as a troodontid, but Makovicky (1995) recognized
it as <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.<br>
Sues (1977) described two dentaries (UA 12091 and 12339) discovered in
1969 and 1974 respectively. He referred these to <i>Dromaeosaurus sp.</i>,
but they were later realized to be <i>Saurornitholestes</i> (Paul,
1988).<br>
The holotype (RTMP 74.10.5) was discovered in 1974, and described by
Sues (1978) as a new genus of dromaeosaurid.  Currie and Evans
(2020) report "the quarry was reopened in 2002 and additional cranial
material was recovered" including a lacrimal, jugal, postorbital and
angular described in that paper.<br>
<b>Recent discoveries</b>- Howse and Milner (1993) illustrated a sacrum
(NHMUK R4463) and identified it as a troodontid, comparing it favorably
to <i>Ornithodesmus</i>. Makovicky (1995) reidentified it as <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
which was first published publically in Norell and Makovicky (1997).<br>
Makovicky (1995) describes the caudal vertebrae of RTMP 82.26.1 in
depth. It is also mentioned by Currie (1995, 2005).<br>
RTMP 88.121.39 is a specimen discovered in 1988 and first mentioned by
Currie et al. (1990). The dorsal ribs were noted to be apneumatic by
Britt (1993). Makovicky (1995) described the elongate distal caudal
prezygapophyseal anatomy. Currie (1995) noted it has a T-shaped
quadratojugal, fifteen dentary teeth, fused interdental plates, a
posterior splenial notch, a collumnar articular process and elongated
distal caudal prezygapophyses. Christiansen (1999) lists measurements
for the femur and tibia. Xu et al. (1999) noted the glenoid faced
laterally and the coracoid was similar to other dromaeosaurids.
Jacobsen (2001) describes and illustrates the dentary, noting tooth
marks on the bone (these were previously mentioned by Tanke and Currie,
2000). He stated the specimen is under study by Currie and Varricchio.
Rauhut (2003) lists the scapular dimensions, and illustrates the
splenial, scapulocoracoid and fibula. Codd (2004) notes that there are
scars for uncinate processes on three preserved ribs. Jasinowski et al.
(2006) illustrate and describe the scapulocoracoid and humerus.
Brusatte et al. (2013) list various limb element lengths.  Funston
and Currie (2018) figure the tibiotarsus in different views. 
Currie and Evans (2020) describe and figure the cranial material.<br>
MOR 660 is a partial skeleton discovered in 1990. Britt (1993)
describes the pneumaticity of MOR 660 and notes it is being studied by
Currie and Varricchio. Makovicky (1995) describes the presacral and
sacral morphology in depth. Novas (1998) mentions the ulna has a feeble
olecranon process and lacks the proximoanterior process for
articulation with the radius. Currie and Dong (2001) note that the
anterior dorsals have very large hyapophyses. Hutchinson (2001)
illustrates the ilium, and notes it has a supratrochanteric process and
a reduced but present cuppedicus fossa. Rauhut (2003) notes it has a
concave anterior pubic peduncle edge, while he notes the posterior
dorsal centra are subcircular, all dorsal centra are pleurocoelous and
the presence of five sacral vertebrae in his theropod phylogeny study
from that same year. He also illustrates manual ungual II. Claessens
(2004) studied the medial gastralia of the specimen. Organ and Adams
(2005) studied the histology of elongate prezygapophyses and chevrons
from this specimen. Novas and Pol (2005) note the radius has a
triangular proximal articular surface and the femur is robust. Martinez
and Novas (2006) note the distal ulna has an anteroposteriorly expanded
articular surface. Turner et al. (2007) lists the femoral length in
their supplementary information table. Norell et al. (2006) note the
posterior cervicals lack carotid processes, but have a raised lip
instead. Csiki et al. (2010) list the hindlimb measurements. Brusatte
et al. (2013) list various limb element lengths.<br>
Norell and Makovicky (1997) note the last dorsal centrum and sacral
centra of RTMP 67.20.36 are pleurocoelous. <br>
Christiansen (1999) lists measurements for the tibia and fibula of MOR
666.<br>
Xu et al. (1999) mention a sternal plate found in 1992 (RTMP 92.36.333)
that was later described in detail by Godfrey and Currie (2004).<br>
Hutchinson (2001) identified an ischium (RTMP 86.77.2) as <i>Troodon</i>,
but it is more likely <i>Saurornitholestes</i> based on comparison to <i>Bambiraptor</i>
and <i>Troodon</i> specimen MOR 553L. <br>
Rauhut (2003) mentions there are five sacral vertebrae in RTMP
92.36.129.<br>
Rauhut (2004) lists RTMP 94.12.844 (a maxilla), but it was not
described and illustrated until Currie and Varricchio's (2004)
paper.  Powers et al. (2022) provide CT scans of the element.<br>
Currie and Evans (2015) reported a new incomplete skeleton (UALVP
55700- McFeeters, pers. comm. 2015) found on June 20 2014.  It
preserves uncinate processes, furcula, sternum and sternal ribs, with a
shorter and broader snout then <i>Velociraptor</i>
and a larger pedal ungual II.  The skull was described in depth by
Currie and Evans (2020), who state the mandibular CT scans and
postcrania "will be described in a separate paper."<br>
UALVP 55425 is a fused surangular and articular found on May 25 2009
(Currie and Evans, 2020).<br>
Hohman and Varricchio (2021) described juvenile maxilla MOR 9753 found
in the 1990 from Bob's Vacation Site, which is smaller than <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span>'s holotype but shares
characters with <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
suggesting the former is not a juvenile of the latter.<br>

<b>Late Campanian, Late Cretaceous<br>
De-na-zin Member of Kirtland Formation, New Mexico, US</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (SMP VP-1270) frontal (42.8 mm) (Sullivan and Lucas,
2000)<br>
<b>Referred</b>- ?(NMMNH P-22578) tooth (8.4x4.4x1.9 mm) (Williamson
and Brusatte, 2014)<br>
?(NMMNH P-26201) tooth (Williamson and Brusatte, 2014) <br>

?(SMP VP-1901) tooth (15 mm) (Sullivan, 2006)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Jasinski, 2015) differs from <i>S. langstoni</i>
in- more constricted anteriorly; less prominent nasal facets; less
prominent anterior projection between the nasal and lacrimal facet
regions; deeper and less strongly demarcated orbital rim; deeper and
more prominent olfactory bulb surface; more pronounced and longer
ventrally-directed ridge between the olfactory bulb surface and the
cerebral hemisphere surface; more robust frontal median sutural
surface; while slightly smaller, still being more robust.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Sullivan and Lucas (2000) described SMP VP-1270 as an
individual of <i>Saurornitholestes langstoni</i>. Later, Sullivan
(2006) described another frontal as the new species <i>S. robustus</i>,
referring the original frontal and two more elements to this taxon.
Evans et al. (2014) later reidentified <i>S. robustus</i> as a
troodontid, though the other remains are still dromaeosaurid.
Williamson and Brusatte (2014) described more teeth as Dromaeosauridae
morphotype A, which they found fall within the range of variation of
Dinosaur Park <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. Jasinski (2015) used SMP
VP-1270 as the holotype of his new species <i>Saurornitholestes
sullivani</i>, and kept other De-na-zin dromaeosaurid remains as
indeterminate. However, only the <i>S. langstoni</i> holotype was
compared, not other specimens of that species to check for variation
which might explain <i>sullivani</i>'s differences. Furthermore, most
other North American dromaeosaurids from the Late Cretaceous (<i>Acheroraptor</i>,
<i>Atrociraptor</i><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) don't
preserve frontals, making proposed <i>Saurornitholestes</i> frontal

<b>Comments</b>- Ryan and Russell (2001) listed the frontal RTMP
89.55.47 as "<i>Saurornitholestes</i> undescribed n. sp. (Currie pers.
comm.)". Bell and Currie (2015) described this and other material
(distal caudal RTMP 88.55.129, manual ungual UALVP 53597, and pedal
ungual II RTMP 86.55.184) from the Pipestone Creek <i>Pachyrhinosaurus
lakustai</i> bonebed as <i>Boreonykus certekorum</i>, noting that
preserved elements are not duplicated and are properly proportioned to
belong to one individual. The fourteen referred teeth are shed so were
admitted to at least belong to another individual. While the authors
assigned <i>Boreonykus</i> to Velociraptorinae, Cau (online, 2015)
noted the frontal differs from dromaeosaurids and that its association
with the postcrania cannot be substantiated. <i>Boreonykus</i> is here
placed as ?Paraves incertae sedis, though it may be <i>Paronychodon</i>.<br>
McCrea and Buckley (2004) first reported a theropod tooth excavated
with a hadrosaur from British Columbia in 2002-2003.  Reid (2016)
notes McCrea assigned it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
online, and he refers it to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Boreonykus
certekorum</span> based on the formation and lack of distal inclination.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Carpenter (1982)
considered UCMP 125238 to be probably conspecific with Hell Creek
specimen UW 13684. Both have fused interdental plates, subrectangular
alveoli and elongate external foramina, which Carpenter compares to <i>Velociraptor</i>
(in which he includes <i>Saurornitholestes</i>). These characters are
also present in more basal dromaeosaurids such as <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
and <i>Bambiraptor</i>, though the elongate foramina does distinguish
the dentary fragments from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. The former preserves
a short, curved tooth with poorly developed mesial serrations and 5.5
distal serrations per mm. Referred teeth are short, strongly curved and
highly compressed, with well developed distal serrations and variably
developed mesial ones. Carpenter states they resemble <i>Velociraptor</i>,
which may indicate they belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>.
<br>
FMNH PR2897 is a <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span>-style
premaxillary tooth, more similar to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span> holotype than some <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes langstoni</span> in
lacking mesial serrations and having a concave apicodistal edge.

AMNH 22670 is listed as <i>Deinonychus sp.</i> on the AMNH website,
but this is unlikely due to the age difference from the Cloverly
Formation.<br>
Baszio (1997) refers Lance Formation teeth (UA BTB coll.) to <i>Saurornitholestes
sp.</i>, but notes they differ from <i>S. langstoni</i> in being
smaller, with rounded basal serrations and mesial serrations which are
developed as a slight serrated structure if present. The premaxillary
tooth UA BTB 132 has numerous, strong ridges unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Atrociraptor.</span><br>
The YPM specimens are listed as Dromaeosauridae, but photos indicate
they are 'velociraptorine'-type teeth with high DSDIs.<br>

(Xu et al., 2010)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Norell et al., 2006) paroccipital process
pendulous; maxillary fenestra large; maxillary fenestra located at
anterior edge of antorbital fossa (also in <i>Atrociraptor</i>); jugal
meets the squamosal to exclude the postorbital from the margin of the
infratemporal fenestra.<br>
(after Xu et al., 2010) Xu et al. listed two characters supposedly
shared between <i>Linheraptor</i> and <i>Tsaagan</i>, which would be
diagnostic of the latter if they are synonymous- lacrimal with
relatively broad medial lamina; sharp angle between anterior and dorsal
processes of quadratojugal.<br>
(after Turner et al., 2012) oval-shaped foramen magnum; low coracoid
tuber; weak subglenoid shelf; dorsoventrally oriented path of
supracoracoid nerve through coracoid.<br>
(after Xu et al., 2015) Note Xu et al. viewed <i>Tsaagan</i> and <i>Linheraptor</i>
as taxonomically distinct, but listed the following characters as
shared between them. Promaxillary fenestra not visible in lateral view;
maxilla without ridge dorsal to supralabial foramina (also probably in <i>Achillobator</i>);
longitudinal fossa along midline of nasals (also in <i>Velociraptor</i>);
jugal without ridge parallel to orbital rim; frontal supraorbital rim
rugose (also in <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>); parietal with prominent nuchal
crest (also in <i>Adasaurus</i>); parietal forms entire nuchal crest
(also in <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>); pterygoid flange small (also in <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>);
all teeth without mesial serrations (also in some microraptorians).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Norell et al. (2006) originally listed
paroccipital process not twisted distally in their diagnosis, but this
is absent in the <i>Linheraptor</i> holotype (Xu et al., 2015). Turner
et al. (2012) suggested it was taphonomic in the <i>Tsaagan</i>
holotype, though Xu et al. view it as a character supporting taxonomic
separation of the specimens. Similarly, Norell et al. listed
'basipterygoid process elongate and anteroventrally directed' as being
diagnostic, but the <i>Linheraptor</i> holotype has shorter processes
which are only ventrally directed. Again, Xu et al. view it as having
taxonomic implications, thouigh it could also be individual variation.<br>
Xu et al. (2010) listed two supposed autapomorphies of <i>Linheraptor</i>-
greatly enlarged maxillary fenestra subequal in size to external naris;
several large foramina on lateral surface of jugal. The former would be
individual variation if the genus is a synonym of <i>Tsaagan</i>,
while Xu et al. (2015) later noted the jugal foramina are also present
in <i>Velociraptor</i> and "might be present in <i>T. mangas</i> but
are simply obscured by specimen damage." They also listed 'lacrimal
lacking lateral flange over descending process' as shared between <i>Linheraptor</i>
and <i>Tsaagan</i>, but this is actually untrue for former's holotype
(Xu et al., 2015).<br>
Xu et al. (2015) describe 61 differences between <i>Linheraptor</i>
and <i>Tsaagan</i>, interpreting the following as autapomorphies of
the former- nasal process of premaxilla transversely compressed along
entire length; premaxillary process of nasal terminates at anterior
border of external naris; lacrimal with several anteriorly opening
foramina on dorsal surface (possibly obscured by poor preservation in <i>Tsaagan</i>);
pyramidal projection on anterior border of supratemporal fossa;
supraoccipital crest short and sharp; quadratojugal dorsal process
distally expanded; basipterygoid process is not inclined anteriorly. If
the taxa are synonymous, these are merely examples of individual
variation, as seen in other theropods (e.g. <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>,
<i>Microraptor</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1993 and originally
identified as <i>Velociraptor</i> (e.g. Webster, 1996) before being
identified as a new genus (Turner et al., 2006) then described by
Norell et al. (2006). <i>Tsaagan</i> (under its specimen number) was
used as an OTU in the Theropod Working Group analyses since 2001
however.  Powers et al. (2022) provide CT scan data on the
maxilla. <i>Linheraptor</i>'s holotype was discovered in 2008 and
described by Xu et al. (2010) as a new taxon of dromaeosaurid. Both
Senter (2011) and Turner et al. (2012) synonymized <i>Linheraptor</i>
with <i>Tsaagan</i>, though only the latter justified it. This is
provisionally accepted here despite a recent paper by Xu et al. (2015)
defending <i>Linheraptor</i>'s validity based on 61 differences from <i>Tsaagan</i>.
While these differences are real, Xu et al. do not establish they are
outside the range of individual variation expected for a dromaeosaurid
species. To the contrary, they dismiss the idea of utilizing individual
variation present in <i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i> until authors
"determine how observed morphological variations relate to inter- or
possibly intraspecific factors" ... "by including all <i>Velociraptor</i>
specimens in a specimen-level phylogenetic analysis, by using
morphometric methods to quantify the variation present and by deepening
our understanding of the biological significance of the variations
observed." Yet while ideal, such studies have not been completed for
any Mesozoic theropod. Thus insisting "noticeable variations between <i>L.
exquisitus</i> and <i>T. mangas</i> are grounds for taxonomic
separation" until those studies are done on <i>Velociraptor</i> would
logically result in the numerous differences present between almost all
described individuals of e.g. <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
being viewed as taxonomically significant until the studies are done on
them as well. Such a conclusion is highly unrealistic, and given the
large amount of individual variation present in all theropod species
including <i>V. mongoliensis</i>, <i>Tsaagan</i> and <i>Linheraptor</i>
are accepted as synonymous here until either further specimens show
their differences covary or phylogenetic analyses find them to not be
sister taxa even when their shared characters are included.<br>
<i>Tsaagan</i> has been recovered as a velociraptorine (Senter et al.,
2012; Brusatte et al., 2014) and a saurornitholestiine (Longrich and
Currie, 2009).<br>
<b>IGM 100/3503</b>- Discovered in 1998, Norell et al. (2006) mention
"A second, as yet undescribed species of dromaeosaurid, which differs
from <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan mangas</span>
in frontal morphology [that] is known from the nearby locality of Zos
Wash."  Turner et al. (2007) describe an ulna as IGM 100/981,
referring
it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor mongoliensis</span>
based on sharing several unlisted characteristics.  This specimen
was
said to be from "the Gilvent Wash locality near Ukhaa Tolgod", but IGM
100/981 is a specimen from Khulsan later described as <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuru</span>. 
Napoli et al. (2021) clarified the matter, stating "Turner et al.
(2007a) erroneously identified the Zos Wash specimen as IGM 100/981.
The correct specimen number for the Zos Wash specimen is IGM
100/3503."  Ironically Ruebenstahl et al.'s (2021) abstract also
switches 100/981 and 100/3503, but they do say the Zos Wash specimen
"appears referrable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>,
although it differs from other <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor
mongoliensis</span>
specimens in some respects such as the absence of a dorsal
ectopterygoid recess."  Napoli et al. state "This individual is
currently referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor
mongoliensis</span>
and is under renewed study."  Based on data presented in
Ruebenstahl et
al.'s SVP presentation and preliminary inclusion in the Hartman et al.
maniraptoromorph analysis, I believe it is closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span> and falls within the range
of variation of the latter and <span style="font-style: italic;">Linheraptor</span>.<br>

early on, as the ischium of IGM 100/22 was used in Barsbold's (1983)
pelvic illustration.  Similarly, scorings indicate Norell et al.
(2001) and Senter (2007) used the specimens when scoring <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>
into their TWiG analyses.  However, the fact these were new
specimens besides the <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>
holotype and paratype was not
published until Currie and Varricchio (2004), who provided some dental
information and specimen numbers.  Shortly after in an SVP
abstract, Kubota and Barsbold (2007) determined they are from a
different taxon, with <i>Adasaurus</i> being a velociraptorine which
lived later. They find it to group with <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> and <i>Achillobator</i>
based on the low DSDI, and differ from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> in having
less anterior maxillary teeth with lingually twisted mesial carinae,
and from <i>Achillobator</i> in lacking double dorsal pleurocoels,
lacking caudal pleurocoels, having a low ilium with tapered
postacetabular process and a distally placed obturator process. 
Evans et al. (2013) separated IGM 100/23 (as "Bayanshiree sp. nov.")
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span> in a version of
Longrich and Currie's dromaeosaurid analysis, recovering the former as
the basalmost velociraptorine and <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>
more nested in the subfamily.  Kubota (2015) describes and names
the taxon in his thesis.<br>
Currie and Varricchio (2004) report there are four premaxillary teeth,
eleven maxillary teeth and thirteen dentary teeth in IGM 100/23 and
100/22, but 100/22 doesn't preserve a dentary and only has fragmentary
maxillae (Kubota, 2015). They also state teeth have four serrations per
mm in both mesial and distal carinae, but the actual values are 3.2-5
and 3.5-5.5 respectively (average 4.25 and 4.19). Jasinowski et al.
(2006) list humeri and an ulna for IGM 100/22 (which is only labeled
'dromaeosaur').<br>

Matthew and Brown, 1922<br>
<b>Not <i>Dromaeosaurus</i></b>- The teeth referred to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
by Russell (1935) from the Milk River Formation of Alberta seem to have
a large DSDI, so are more probably <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. Colbert
and Russell (1969) tentatively referred a fourth metatarsal (CMN 12072)
and a pedal ungual II (CMN 12240) to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, as did
Ostrom (1969) for the latter element. Paul (1988b) referred the ungual
to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> instead, as he hypothesized <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
to have a reduced ungual as in <i>Adasaurus</i>. Both elements were
referred to <i>Saurornitholestes</i> by Currie (1995).<br>
Sues (1977) described two dentaries (UA 12091 and 12339) discovered in
1969 and 1974 respectively. He referred these to <i>Dromaeosaurus sp.</i>,
but they were later realized to be <i>Saurornitholestes</i> (Paul,
1988b).<br>
Rowe et al. (1992) identified cf. <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> teeth
(including TMM 43057-314) from the Aguja Formation of Texas. Sankey
(1998) later identified <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> teeth from another area
of that formation, but these and Rowe et al.'s specimens were referred
to Theropoda "family and genus undetermined." They consisted of two
tooth fragments (LSUMG 5483 and 6239) which were similar to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
except in lacking a lingually twisted mesial carina, and were
reidentified as tyrannosaurid teeth by Sankey et al. (2005). <br>
Matthew and Brown (1922) referred <i>Lalaeps laevifrons</i> to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
as <i>D. laevifrons</i>, while Sahni (1972) synonymized it with <i>D.
albertensis</i>. It is properly referred to <i>Saurornitholestes
langstoni</i>. Matthew and Brown also tentatively referred <i>Laelaps
cristatus</i> to the genus as <i>D? cristatus</i>, but this is a <i>Troodon</i>
specimen as recognized by Olshevsky (1995). They referred <i>Laelaps
explanatus</i> to <i>Dromaeosaurus? sp.</i>, which Kuhn (1939)
formalized as <i>Dromaeosaurus explanatus</i>. Sahni synonymized it
with <i>D. albertensis</i>, but is is a <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
specimen. Matthew and Brown also referred <i>Laelaps falculus</i> to <i>Dromaeosaurus?
sp.</i>, which Olshevsky (1978) formalized as <i>Dromaeosaurus falculus</i>.
Sahni also synonymized this species with <i>D. albertensis</i>, but is
it probably a juvenile <i>Gorgosaurus</i> or <i>Daspletosaurus</i>. <i>Zapsalis
abradens</i> was considered comparable to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> by
Matthew and Brown, and Tracy Ford's taxonomic lists include the
combination <i>Dromaeosaurus abradens</i>. More recently, <i>Zapsalis</i>
teeth were called <i>?Dromaeosaurus</i> morphotype A by Sankey et al.
(2002), but <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span> is now
known to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>
premaxillary teeth (Currie and Evans, 2020). Matthew and Brown referred
<i>"Coelurus" gracilis</i> to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> as <i>D? gracilis</i>,
but it cannot be compared to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> though it does seem
to be dromaeosaurid. Tracy Ford's lists also include the combination <i>Dromaeosaurus
minutus</i> for <i>"Ornithomimus" minutus</i>, an alvarezsaurid.
Finally, Paul (1988a) referred <i>Adasaurus</i> to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
as <i>D. mongoliensis</i>, but now that the genus is better understood
it appears to be a more basal dromaeosaurid. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2012) premaxilla deeper and
thicker than other dromaeosaurids; presence of either an enlarged
promaxillary fenestra or an extremely anteroventrally placed maxillary
fenestra with no promaxillary fenestra depending on interpretation of
identity of opening; anteroposterior short lateral lamina of maxilla
anterior to antorbital fossa; nine maxillary teeth; nasals with
V-shaped suture posteriorly between frontals; deep notches anteriorly
on frontal for articulation with lacrimal; tip of frontal flatter and
margin of supratemporal fossa less pronounced; postorbital process of
frontal sharply demarcated from the dorsomedial orbital margin;
quadratojugal stout; dorsal tympanic recess very weakly expressed;
moderately developed preotic pendant; expression of anterior tympanic
recess and/or basipterygoid recess absent on the basisphenoid or
basipterygoid processes; posteromedial process of palatine slender;
anterior and posterior tooth denticles subequal in size; anterior
carina of maxillary or dentary tooth close to midline of tooth near
tip, twists toward lingual surface.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1914 but not described
until 1922 (Matthew and Brown, 1922) as a new subfamily of
tyrannosaurs. Currie (1987a) stated that Dinosaur Park <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
teeth suggest more than one species was present, citing the in prep. at
the time Currie et al. (1990). He noted CMN 12349 is more robust than
the holotype and that the supratemporal fossa ridge is more strongly
curved, implying these could be reason for referring it to the other <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
species. However, Currie et al. never proposed more than one morphotype
of <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> once it was published, though they did refer
to teeth with <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>-like serrations which lack a
twisted mesial carina that "may represent a distinct species of
dromaeosaurid, or a gracile, small form of tyrannosaurid." Similar
teeth from the Aguja Formation have been referred to juvenile
tyrannosaurids.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Is CMN 12349 a therizinosaur frontal?</span>-
Sues (1978) identified frontal CMN 12349 as <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
and frontal CMN 12355 as Theropoda indet., although note his plates 7
and 8 are switched so that they are given each others' captions. Currie
(1987b) accepted CMN 12349 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>,
but with regard to CMN 12355 stated that
"comparison with Mongolian specimens suggests that it may represent <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span> (Currie, in
preparation)."  Currie (1992) again stated CMN 12355 "may
represent the segnosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span>"
(although note that as in Sues' paper it is mislabeled 12349 in his
Figure 2) and also referred TMP 1981.016.0231 to Segnosauridae. 
Currie
(2005) listed CMN 12349 as a tentative "therizinosauroid similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>", but figured CMN
12355 so probably meant that specimen.  Indeed, it seems CMN 12349
was correctly identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
in the first place as it is similar to the holotype and has only been
referred to Therizinosauroidea accidentally due to Sues' original plate
caption mistake.<br>

Definition- (<i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i> &lt;- <i>Microraptor
zhaoianus, Dromaeosaurus albertensis, Unenlagia comahuensis, Passer
domesticus</i>)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Since Turner et al. (2012) uses a stem-based
definition for Dromaeosauridae, the node stem triplet advocated by
Padian et al. (1999) no longer functions. Turner et al.'s definition is
slightly superior to Sereno's 1998 one by adding <i>Microraptor</i>, <i>Unenlagia</i>
and <i>Passer</i>, but I think the chance of a (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> (<i>Velociraptor</i>,
<i>Passer</i>)) topology is very low, and wouldn't have a problem with
microraptorians being velociraptorines. But since Unenlagiinae is
active, I suppose it's best to keep subfamilies out of subfamilies.<br>
Kurzanov (1976) erected Itemiridae for <i>Itemirus</i> only, sister to
tyrannosaurids than to dromaeosaurids. Martynuik (2012) both defined
Itemiridae as excluding <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, and created an undefined
Itemirinae within Dromaeosauridae with no explicit content (besides <i>Itemirus</i>).
Here (as in Longrich and Currie, 2009), <i>Itemirus</i> is recovered
as closer to <i>Velociraptor</i> than to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. This
would technically make Itemirinae a senior synonym of Velociraptorinae,
as the latter family-level taxon was named 7 years later. Yet the <i>Itemirus</i>
holotype has only been found to have this position in one published
analysis, while it was recovered closer to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> by
Sues and Averianov (2014). Thus until there is a consensus on the
position of <span style="font-style: italic;">Itemirus</span>, the
subfamily Velociraptorinae is used here. <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
This specimen was discovered by Norell in July 1991 and mentioned by
Norell et al. (1992) as "a very well preserved, articulated postcranial
skeleton". Novacek (1996) wrote in a popular book ""It lacked a
precious head.  Although Mark [Norell] was understandably upset,
it was still an important find.  Informally called "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ichabodcraniosaurus</span>,"
the skeleton remains under investigation in New York to this
day."  Norell and Makovicky (1999) mention IGM 100/980 several
times, stating it can be referred to Dromaeosauridae based on caudal
and pedal characters, but that insufficient elements are preserved to
refer it to <i>Velociraptor</i>. A photo of the pelvis and adjacent
vertebrae is included as figure 24. Norell (DML, 2002) confirmed that
"Ichabodcraniosaurus" and IGM 100/980 are the same specimen. Turner
(2008) described its anatomy as a new taxon of dromaeosaurid, though he
did not name it. While IGM 100/980 is partially scored in his matrix,
Turner didn't include the specimen in his analysis.  It was
officially described and named <span style="font-style: italic;">Shri
devi</span> by Turner et al. (2021), who included it in a version of
the TWiG analysis which recovered it as a velociraptorine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2012; for <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor mongoliensis</span>, at the
time including IGM 100/982) premaxilla with long maxillary process
reaching well beyond caudal margin of external nares; first and second
premaxillary teeth larger than third and fourth; anterior border of
internal antorbital fenestra broadly rounded; maxillary fenestra not
located in a posteriorly open depression; frontal long, almost four
times longer than wide across orbital portion, and almost four times as
long as parietal; dentary very shallow, its depth constituting 1/8 to
1/7 of its length, ventral margin convex; flange-like m. ambiens
tubercle located proximally on anterior face of pubis.<br>
<b>Not <i>Velociraptor</i></b>- Besides the remains listed below, <i>V.
osmolskae</i>, and Bohlin's (1953) and Young's (1958) questionably
referred specimens, many remains have been referred to <i>Velociraptor</i>
that probably do not belong there. In 1982, Carpenter stated that he
and Paul (in prep.) would show <i>Velociraptor</i> occurred in North
America. Though the collaborative publication never surfaced, Paul
(1984, 1988, 1988) did synonymize <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
with <i>Velociraptor</i>. Recent analyses indicate these do not form a
monophyletic clade with respect to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> however
(Currie and Varricchio, 2004; Senter, 2007), and thus almost all
non-microraptorian, non-unenlagiine dromaeosaurids would be a single
genus under this scheme. Still, this has led to the occassional
identification of <i>Velociraptor</i> in American sediments (eg. AMNH
website). Dong et al. (1989) state <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
material was discovered in the Iren Dabasu Formation of Inner Mongolia,
China, and Dong (1992) specifies "teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>".  Currie and
Eberth (1993) state "Isolated dromaeosaurid teeth and bones are common
in the Iren Dabasu" and that "Most of these can be attributed to <i>Velociraptor</i>..." 
Yet no
rationale was presented, and the only two specified Iren Dabasu
dromaeosaurid elements in the literature are clearly not <i>Velociraptor</i>
(AMNH 6572 is twice the size, while IVPP 270790-4 is different from
most dromaeosaurid teeth). Matsukawa and Obata (1994) report through
personal communication with Mateer (1992) that cf. <i>Velociraptor
mongoliensis</i> was discovered in the Zouyun Formation, though this is
much too early to actually be that genus. Norell et al. (1994)
identified two juvenile skulls as <i>Velociraptor</i>, but these seem
more likely to be <i>Byronosaurus</i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999).
Nessov (1995) notes that unguals attributed to <i>Velociraptor</i> are
known in the Santonian Syuk-Syuk Formation of Kazakhstan, but these
reports have not been verified. The <i>Tsaagan</i> holotype was
originally referred to <i>Velociraptor</i> (e.g. Webster, 1996) before
it was identified as a new genus by Norell et al. (2006).  By 2004
a skull cast was in circulation from Gaston Design Inc., generally
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
(e.g. Witmer, online 2012), but Powers et al. (2020) used maxillary
proportions to find it is closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>. 
Turner et al. (2007) describe an ulna as IGM 100/981, referring it to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor mongoliensis</span>
based on sharing several unlisted
characteristics, but this specimen is actually IGM 100/3503 (Napoli et
al., 2021) and is here placed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>.<br>

longitudinal ischial ridge (also in <i>Deinonychus</i>; unknown in IGM
100/982).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered on August 11 1923 and
originally named <span style="font-style: italic;">Ovoraptor
djadochtari</span> by Osborn (1924a) in a magazine article. Osborn
merely describes it as "a wonderfully alert little egg-snatcher, hence <span style="font-style: italic;">Ovoraptor</span> of the Djadochta
formation", a "swift-moving, carnivorous dinosaur."  However, this
publication lacked a proper description, and Osborn (1924b) decided to
name the taxon <i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i> in his official
description later that year. The skull was redescribed by Sues in 1977.
<br>
IGM 100/25 was discovered in early August 1971 (Kielan-Jaworowska and
Barsbold, 1972), initially mentioned as "the skeleton of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor mongoliensis</span> preserved
together with the skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protoceratops
andrewsi</span>"
and photographed as plate II figure 2.  It was described briefly
by Barsbold (1974), with the skull, sterna, pedal digit II illustrated
by him in 1983. Now known as the "fighting dinosaurs" specimen, it has
been analyzed by several authors (Osmolska, 1993; Unwin et al., 1995;
Carpenter, 2000).  Barsbold and Osmolska (1999) described the
skull in detail, while Currie et al. (2016) provide manual measurements
for it. Paul (1984, 1988) first noticed unicinate processes, which were
described in detail by Codd (2004).<br>
Barsbold (1983) also mentioned another specimen, IGM 100/24, a
"partially destroyed skull and remains of postcranial skeleton". He
illustrates the medial mandible.  Barsbold and Osmolska (1999)
note it was discovered by a Mongolian expedition, and illustrate the
skull and braincase.<br>
PIN 3143/8 was discovered at Tugrikin Shire by the Soviet-Mongolian
expedition, who also found material at Ikh Shunkht (Ivakhnenko and
Kurzanov, 1988 misstyped as 1982 in Watabe et al., 2010). 
Barsbold and Osmolska (1999) state the postcrania of IGM 100/24 and
100/25 "will be published at a later date (Barsbold &amp;
Osmolska in preparation)."<br>
IGM 100/976 was discovered in 1991 and mentioned by Norell et al.
(1992). Norell et al. (1997) briefly described the furcula, while the
other postcrania were described in depth by Norell and Makovicky
(1999), the braincase was described by Norell et al. (2004) and the
endocast by King et al. (2020). IGM 100/985 and 100/986 were discovered
in 1993, and described by Norell and Makovicky in 1997 and 1999
respectively. Though IGM 100/985 was originally only referred to
Dromaeosauridae indet., it was referred to <i>Velociraptor</i>
specifically by 1999.<br>
Three <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> specimens
were listed by Watabe and Suzuki (2000) as being from Tugrikin Shire
found between July 21 and August 1 1994.  The best described is
IGM 100/54, with the field number 940728 TS-V NAR from Tugrikin Shire
V, photographed by them as "complete skeleton (fore limb shown) of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
in Tugrikin Shire".  This is complete except the distal tail and
left forelimb, with the skull and mandible photographed as plate 1
figure 3 in Tsogtbaatar (2004), the skeleton as figure 2 in that
publication and in higher resolution in Saneyoshi et al. (2011). 
Hone et al. (2012) and Codd (2004) provide good photographs of the
torso, while Hattori (2016) describes and illustrates a
metatarsus.  Hone et al. described a pterosaur (?azhdarchid) long
bone fragment eaten by the specimen, while Saneyoshi et al. described
taphonomy.  Jasinoski et al. (2006) used this specimen (listed as
IGM 94.07.28) for pectoral and forelimb information.  Currie et
al. (2016) lists manual measurements for MPC-D unnumbered specimen,
which are here guessed to be IGM 100/54 given the &lt;10% length
difference using the un-ideal scale in Senoyoshi et al.'s photo (scale
bar inserted digitally over an oblique photograph).  <br>
A specimen collected in August 26 1998 and reported by Suzuki and
Watabe (2000), "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
forelimbs" with field number 980826 BDz Velocira ENKH discovered at
Bayn Dzak, was listed as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
lower jaw and partial postcranial bones."  The in situ specimen
980826 BDz Velocira ENKH is figured as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> skeleton in Bayn Dzak
(central Gobi region)."<br>

(after Powers et al., 2020) elongate antorbital fossa.<br>
(after Powers et al., 2021a) anteriorly abbreviated cerebellar fossa

(after Powers et al., 2022) maxillary fenestra within a broad, shallow
maxillary fossa that extends anterior to the maxillary fenestra.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- IGM 100/982 was
discovered in 1995 and first mentioned by Norell and Makovicky (1997)
as an undescribed dromaeosaur specimen collected by the MAS-AMNH
expeditions possessing a wide flat brevis shelf on its ilium.  The
postcranium was described by Norell and Makovicky in 1999, while the
braincase was described by Norell et al. (2004).  The skull was
first figured in figure 6C of Norell et al. (2006).  Norell and
Makovicky referred it "to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor
mongoliensis</span> based on
comparisons of cranial material with the holotype (AMNH 6515)",
although even this early on they did note "A poorly defined vertical
crest above the acetabulum that divides the anterior and posterior
muscle fossae on the lateral surface of the pelvis is present on IGM
100/982 but is absent on other specimens."  In an abstract,
Kundrat
(2004) noted several braincase characters which differed between it and
IGM 100/976, concluding "IGM 100/982 represents a more advanced
velociraptorine morphotype than does IGM 100/976" although he wrongly
thought it was 100/982 that was confirmed to be <span style="font-style: italic;">V. mongoliensis</span> and
100/976 that "might be referable to a new velociraptorine taxon." 
Powers (2020) names and describes the new species in his thesis, which
also has sections which have been published since.  Powers et al.
(2020) discovered that using maxillary morphometrics "MPC-D 100/982
plotted far away from all other specimens referred to the genus
<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>, the separation
being greater than that seen among many
specimens representing different species" and states "A description of
this specimen and review of variation within the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> is
currently underway."  Similarly, Powers et al. (2022)
provides CT data on the maxilla and mentions it as "a possible third
[species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>]
based on a currently undescribed specimen
(MPC-D 100/982, description in prep.)", although as noted above many
aspects of the specimen have been described in the literature. 
Two abstracts devoted to the new species were published in 2021 (Powers
et al., 2021a, b).<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- These are specimens
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
which have not been described, figured or preserved well enough to
refer to either <span style="font-style: italic;">V. mongoliensis</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">V. sp.</span> nov..  Indeed,
basically none of them are complete enough or have been described well
enough to even refer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>,
and could easily be <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Shri</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuru</span> or another eudromaeosaur.<br>
Bohlin (1953) referred two teeth, and more questionably a penultimate
phalanx and ungual, to <i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i> (mispelled <i>V.
mongoliense</i>). The teeth are indeed probably dromaeosaurid, and
roughly similar to <i>Velociraptor</i>. While they lack mesial
serrations like the geographically close <i>V. osmolskae</i>, <i>V.
mongoliensis</i> teeth often lack mesial serrations as well (perhaps
due to wear in some cases). They are thus indeterminate at least within
<i>Velociraptor</i>, and probably within basal Dromaeosauridae. The
phalanx is said to be broader than <i>Velociraptor</i>'s III-3 and the
illustrated ungual is clearly a parvicursorine manual ungual I however.
<br>
Young (1958) referred IVPP V965 to cf. <i>Velociraptor mongoliensis</i>,
although stated it is "somewhat larger than the type".  As it is
based
on a single tooth, referral to any particular dromaeosaurid species is
questionable.<br>
AMNH 6518 was discovered on August 11 1923, but not published until
Ostrom (1969) who illustrated several phalanges.  Images of the
entire specimen are available at the AMNH online catalog.<br>
ZPAL MgD-I/97 was found between 1963 and 1971 on the Polish-Mongolian
expeditions, and is mentioned briefly by Osmolska (1982) in her
description of <i>Hulsanpes</i>. 
The crania are figured by Barsbold and Osmolska (1999), who say the
postcrania "will be published at a later date (Barsbold &amp;
Osmolska in preparation)."<br>
IGM 100/2000
was listed as "the complete skeleton of a young individual. It includes
skull with mandible and postcranium" by Barsbold and Osmolska (1999),
who also wrote it was found "by the Mongolian-Japanaese
Palaeontological Expeditions" at Tugrikin Shire.  It is possibly
the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
skull and small skeleton" reported by Watabe and SuzukI (2000). 
Those authors list 940725 TS-V OTGN and 940801 TS-I WTB as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> skeleton" from
Tugrikin Shire V and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
skeleton" from Tugrikin Shire I respectively, but which specimen became
IGM 100/2000 is unknown and no description or illustration of either
has been published.<br>
Suzuki and Watabe (2000) reported two new <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> specimens collected in
1998.  "The postcranial skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>"
with field number 980725 TS-I Velocira NAR discovered on July 25 at
Tugrikin Shire I, described as consisting of "dorsal vertebrae, ribs,
pelvic part, hind limb, and complete tail"; and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> forelimbs" discovered
between August 16-23 at Udyn Sayr.<br>
Smith (2002) uses IGM 100/200 as one of his <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
dental specimens used to measure tooth shape in his gigantic database
of theropods, which includes a premaxillary tooth and a maxillary
fragment that includes at least six tooth positions.<br>
Watabe and Tsogtbaatar (2004) report "teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>" discovered on July 23
2000 at Udyn Sayr.  <br>
Hone et al. (2010) describe two teeth found in 2008-2009 from the
Wulansuhai Formation of Inner Mongolia as <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>, associated with a cf.
<span style="font-style: italic;">Protoceratops</span> skeleton
exhibiting tooth-marked bones.  These teeth have mesial
serrations, so are unlikely to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">"Velociraptor" osmolskae</span>
which are both known from this formation.  Yet no characters are
described that would refer these to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
over another dromaeosaurid with mesial serrations and a high DSDI, so
they are only tentatively referred here.<br>

"Airakoraptor" was originally listed in a bibliographic entry in Perle
et al.'s (1999) description of <i>Achillobator</i>.
This supposed paper is listed as authored by Norell, Clark and Perle in
a 1992 issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. No pages
numbers or issue are listed, though it does say "Vol. 11 Toronto.
Canada", which indicates it refers to an abstract from the Toronto
Society of Vertebrate paleontology meeting in 1992 (volume 11 covered
the 1991 meeting in San Diego, so must be a mistake). There is an
abstract in that issue by those authors, but it has a different title
which does not mention "Airakoraptor" by name. Instead of "Morphology
dromaeosaurian dinosaur- Airakoraptor from the Upper Cretaceous of
Mongolia", it is simply "New dromaeosaur material from the Late
Cretaceous of Mongolia". So Perle et al.'s listing must refer to an
earlier version of the abstract.  Napoli et al. (2021) confirm
that of
the specimens noted in the abstract, IGM 100/981 was "familiar
(erroneously) under the provisional name "Airakoraptor," and that "the
name is a nomen nudum."  <br>
IGM 100/981 was initially mentioned by Norell et al. (1992) as "a
partial skeleton including portions of the skull, mandible, vertebral
column, manus and pes" and said to "possess features unknown in
described
dromaeosaurs" such as a deep mandible and dual posterior
surangular foramina.  This specimen is also probably that
described by
Novacek (1996) as discovered by Perle on July 4th - "a fine skeleton of
a
dromaeosaur, perhaps not <i>Velociraptor</i> but something rare, and
new", since <span style="font-style: italic;">Shri</span> was found by
Norell.  It was later mentioned as an "unnamed dromaeosaur from
Khulsan collected by the Mongolian American Expeditions" by Norell and
Makovicky (1997), stated to have a wide and flat brevis shelf and share
an anterior tubercle on metatarsal III with <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>.
In Norell and Makovicky (1999) it is noted to lack a fourth trochanter,
unlike <i>Velociraptor</i>.
They state it "can be referred to the Dromaeosauridae on the basis of
pedal and tail morphology, but insufficient elements are present to
refer these specimens to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> mongoliensis</span>."
Norell et al. (2006) illustrate the surangular as "an undescribed
dromaeosaur from Khulson (IGM 100/981)" and it clearly shows dual
surangular foramina, matching figure 6A of Napoli et al. (2021) who
finally described the specimen as <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuru
kulla</span>. Confusingly, Turner et
al. (2007) described an ulna of a supposed <i>Velociraptor</i>
specimen they called IGM 100/981. This specimen was said to be from the
Gilvent Wash locality near Ukhaa Tolgod, and Napoli et al. state the
specimen number was erroneous and is actually IGM 100/3503 which is
here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsaagan</span>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kubota and Barsbold, 2006) dorsoventrally
expanded anterior process of jugal; low dorsal ridge on median frontals
(continuous with sagittal crest on parietals); untwisted paroccipital
process; large surangular foramen; pleurocoels only on anterior
sacrals; preacetabular process strongly notched anteriorly.<br>
(after Turner et al., 2012) ventral process of lacrimal strongly curved
anteriorly; dorsally displaced triangular process along lateral edge of
quadrate shaft.<br>
(proposed) metatarsal II reduced in width.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Barsbold (1983) and most later
references, the supposed small pedal ungual II does not belong to digit
II (Senter, 2010).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This genus was discovered between 1964 and 1966, and
first mentioned by Barsbold (1977) as a "latest (Maastrichtian)
Mongolian Dromaeosauridae" with a reduced pedal ungual II, with the
pelvis illustrated and labeled as <i>Adasaurus</i>. This does not
count as a proper description however, due to the lack of a type
species or holotype.  Osmolska (1980) lists one dromaeosaurid
taxon and individual from the Nemegt Formation (as ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> sp.), which may be
based on <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>
and may be the source of Glut's (1982) reference to "a possible
dromaeosaurid, mentioned by Osmolska (1978), from the Nemegt Formation
of Mongolia."  Note no Osmolska reference from 1978 exists and <span style="font-style: italic;">Adasaurus</span>
was already listed by Glut on page 40 however.  The taxon was
later described extremely briefly by Barsbold (1983) and officially
named <i>Adasaurus mongoliensis</i>, though the paratype was mistyped
as IGM 100/51. While remaining poorly described and virtually
unillustrated in the literature for decades due to an embargo, <i>Adasaurus</i>
has finally been partially illustrated and described by Turner et al.
(2012) with a full description in Kubota's (2015) thesis. Although
Currie and Varricchio (2004) referred snout and forelimb remains to <i>Adasaurus</i>
based on IGM 100/22 and 100/23, Kubota and Barsbold (2007) have
determined these belong to a new taxon from the earlier Bayanshiree
Formation.<br>
The holotype specimen was approximately 2.7 meters long if the femur is
scaled from <i>Velociraptor</i>. It was from an old individual, so
this is probably close to the maximum size <i>Adasaurus</i> got.
Contra Norell and Makovicky (1997), the specimen is not pathological
(Turner et al., 2012).<br>
Jasinowski et al. (2006) list a scapulocoracoid and sternal plate for
the holotype. The pelvis was illustrated by Barsbold (1983) after the
initial schematic drawing in Barsbold (1977), but this is quite
different from the actual material as it is a composite with the
holotype's ilium and pubis and IGM 100/22's ischium.. The femoral
morphology was briefly noted by Perle et al. (1999) and Kim et al.
(2005). The latter also illustrate the proximal femur in two views.
While <i>Adasaurus</i> is perhaps most famous due to its supposedly
reduced second pedal ungual, Senter (2010 as a 2006 pers. comm. from
Kubota) notes that ungual does not actually pertain to the holotype's
digit II. <br>
<b>Relationships</b>- <i>Adasaurus</i> was originally identified as a
dromaeosaurid (Barsbold, 1977) and later specified to be a
dromaeosaurine (Barsbold, 1983; Paul, 1988).  More recently,
Longrich and Currie (2009) found it to be a velociraptorine, which was
also found by Kubota and Barsbold (2006, 2007), Senter et al. (2012),
Turner et al. (2012), Brusatte et al. (2014) and Foth et al. (2014).
There is certainly no reason to synonymize <i>Adasaurus</i> with <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
as Paul (1988) did, as many other dromaeosaurid genera seem to be more
closely related to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>.<br>

"koreanensis" was used in a photo caption and faunal list. Lee et al.
(2001) remove the specimen from <i>Deinonychus</i>, based on the
presence of a fourth trochanter. However, <i>Deinonychus</i> varies in
this character. Kim et al. (2005) refer the specimen to Eumaniraptora
based on a proximolateral ridge, shelf-like posterior trochanter, and
absence of an accessory trochanter and mediodistal crest. The presence
of a large fourth trochanter was noted to be similar to <i>Adasaurus</i>
and <i>Velociraptor</i>.<br>

five years later, but is used here based on being universally accepted

Holotype</b>- (IVPP V12638) (subadult or adult) (~1.3-2 kg) four
partial dorsal ribs, seven gastralia or sternal ribs, furcula, scapulae
(65 mm), coracoids, humeri (89 mm), radii (63 mm), ulnae (62, 64 mm),
scapholunare, semilunate carpal, distal carpal III, metacarpal I (14.5

mm), phalanx III-2 (8 mm), phalanx III-3 (22 mm), manual ungual III
(22.5, 23 mm), manual claw sheaths, fragments, feathers<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 2001 and described in
2003 as a maniraptoran perhaps most closely related to
scansoriopterygids. This was based on the elongate manus (compared to
humerus) and phalanx II-2 (compared to metacarpal II). These are
correlated with each other however, as an elongate phalanx II-2 will
lead to a long manus. In addition to scansoriopterygids,
tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, troodontids, and some
dromaeosaurids, basal avialans and basal coelurosaurs have similarly
elongate II-2 (compared to II-1). Dececchi et al. (2010) restudied the
specimen for an SVP abstract and while they were secretive regarding
its phylogenetic position, do indicate it is not a paravian. Dececchi
et al. (2012) later published a full paper, noting the presence of a
furcula, and finding it to be a maniraptoran in a polytomy with
alvarezsaurids, therizinosaurs and pennaraptorans. Xu et al. (2013)
replied, describing misinterpretations of anatomy by Dececchi et al.,
including the supposed intermedium being a broken part of the
semilunate carpal. They noted Dececchi et al. coded <i>Yixianosaurus</i>
for many characters that could not be determined from the specimen, and
their recoded matrix found it to be a deinonychosaur outside of
Unenlagiinae, Eudromaeosauria and Troodontidae. Foth et al. (2014)
recovered the genus as a basal paravian.<br>

Brown discovered AMNH 3015 in 1931, and AMNH 3037 in 1932.  As
Chure and McIntosh (1989) stated, Brown proposed "Daptosaurus agilis"
with the intended holotype AMNH 3015, but "never got around to
describing these animals, and it was left to John Ostrom to describe
and name them many years later in 1970, based in many cases on much
better and more diagnostic material which he had collected." 
"None of Brown's names were ever published (until Glut 1972 [for
"Peltosaurus"]) and it does no harm to mention them here, as Ostrom's
names are well established taxa having full priority. Brown's names,
however, were used in public lectures, and for a time on some exhibited
specimens. In addition, they were written on photographs and
preliminary skeletal reconstructions made under Brown's
direction."  In his 1931 field report, Brown first mentioned <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> in saying "closely
associated with one <span style="font-style: italic;">Tentontosaurus</span>
skeleton is a small carnivorous dinosaur but encased in lime difficult
to prepare" (Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, 2006).  <br>
The
YPM paratypes were found in 1964-1966 (YPM online), with the
holotype being discovered in late August 1964.  The YPM quarry was
reopened in 1993 by the MOR, resulting in abundant new material (MOR
747; Maxwell and Witmer, 1996)- "one cervical vertebra, several caudal
vertebrae, a radius and ulna, two manus, two pes, and portions of the
skull, including ... the prefrontal, frontal, parietal, quadrate,
laterosphenoid, and portions of the braincase. Other cranial elements
in the new sample, such as the nasal, lacrimal, and ectopterygoid are
the best samples collected to date."  Powers et al. (2022)
describe the maxilla of YPM 5232 in detail based on CT scans.<br>
MCZ 4371 was found in July 1974 and described by Ostrom (1976). 
Ostrom (1969b) believed that "YPM 5203 (a caudal sequence), 5205 (left
and right pes), 5206 (left and right manus) and 52010 (several
vertebrae and an incomplete skull and jaws) belong to a single
individual because of distinct preservation common to these alone and
the fact that they are all slightly larger than other comparable
lements obtained at the Yale site" but could not prove it.  The
three articulated caudal series (YPM 5201-5203) show at least three
individuals were present among YPM 5201-5265, and Maxwell and Witmer
report four right splenials showing at least four were present.  <br>
Ostrom (1969a, b) misidentified the scapholunare as an ulnare, the
semilunate carpal as the radiale (= scapholunare in maniraptoriforms),
and the coracoid as the pubis.<br>
Parsons and Parsons (2002) initially identified MOR 1178 as a new
troodontid-like taxon based on an apparent parietal sagittal crest,
dorsal groove on distal caudal vertebrae, robust metatarsal IV and
pedal ungual ratios similar to <i>Troodon</i>. However, in the period
between abstract submission and conference poster, they had
reidentified it as a subadult <i>Deinonychus</i>. This was published
in their 2003 paper, with no mention of the ectopterygoid or metatarsal
IV that were noted in 2002. They may have been reidentified as the
squamosal fragment and metatarsal II. The supposed parietal fragment
was reidentified as a sacral fragment. Some features such as highly
elongated forelimbs and curved manual ungual III are seen as
ontogenetic differences from adult specimens. <br>
Parsons and Parsons (2004) describe another young <i>Deinonychus</i>
(MCZ 8791) which was discovered in 1982. It is smaller than MOR 1178
and has even longer forelimbs. Parsons and Parsons (2013) describe
further details of this specimen. <br>
Parsons and Parsons (2006) report on "newly discovered specimen" MOR
1182<br>
Makovicky and Grellet-Tinner (2000) and Grellet-Tinner's (2005) thesis
described <i>Deinonychus</i> eggshells preserved with AMNH 3015 but
left unidentified for decades, which were officially published as
Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky (2006).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Texas specimens</span>- Main et al.

497715-497717, 497719-497721 and 497727 were discovered in 1998. 
Lipka (1998) described UNSM 497715, 497719-497720 and 497727 as
'deinonychids' that likely "represent an East Coast occurrence of <span style="font-style: italic;">D. antirrhopus</span>",
with a figure of USNM 497727 labeled "Probable deinonychid lateral
tooth."  Brownstein's (2018) Figure 2 includes "Teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> sp. (1-4)", which are
USNM 497719, 497717, 497721 and 497715 respectively based on the USNM
online catalog. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships- </span><i>Deinonychus</i>
was traditionally identified as a velociraptorine, but has most
recently been recovered as a dromaeosaurine (Senter et al., 2012; Foth
et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014), sister taxon to
Velociraptorinae+Dromaeosaurinae (Longrich and Currie, 2009), or a
velociraptorine after all (Brusatte et al., 2014). <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Sues and Averianov, 2014) differs from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
in- basipterygoid recesses on dorsolateral surfaces of basipterygoid
processes present (also in <i>Velociraptor</i>, <i>Tsaagan</i> and <i>Bambiraptor</i>);
mesial serrations of teeth significantly smaller than distal serrations
(also in most dromaeosaurids except <i>Utahraptor</i> and <i>Achillobator</i>;
teeth tentatively referred). Differs from <i>Utahraptor</i> in-
pleurocoels present in anterior dorsals (also in other dromaeosaurids
except <i>Yurgovuchia</i>; vertebrae tentatively referred). Differs
from both <i>Utahraptor</i> and <i>Achillobator</i> in lateral
surfaces of dorsal centra have deep, emarginated fossae (also in <i>Deinonychus</i>;
vertebrae tentatively referred).<br>
(suggested) occipital condyle wider than foramen magnum. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype braincase was discovered in 1958, and
described by Kurzanov as the new genus <i>Itemirus</i> in 1976(a,b).
Kurzanov assigned <i>Itemirus</i> to its own family, Itemiridae, which
he placed sister to Tyrannosauridae, with these both sister to
Dromaeosauridae (including <i>Stenonychosaurus</i> but not <i>Saurornithoides</i>)
within the Carnosauria. Theropod braincases were poorly known at the
time so there was little to compare <i>Itemirus</i> to and much of the
description is outdated. Some aspects were described in a more modern
perspective by Currie and Zhao (1994), in comparison with <i>Troodon</i>.
Chure and Madsen (1998) found the deep basipterygoid recesses to be
similar to their cf. <i>Stokesosaurus</i> braincase, but noted several
characters were less derived than <i>Stokesosaurus</i> and
tyrannosaurids. This feature led Holtz (2004) to refer to <i>Itemirus</i>
as a possible tyrannosauroid, though it has been since noted in most
dromaeosaurids and basal paravians. Longrich and Currie (2009) found <i>Itemirus</i>
to clade in Velociraptorinae, based on a paravian matrix. Miyashita
(2011) used a coelurosaur matrix which grouped <i>Itemirus</i> with
tyrannosauroids, but noted (DML, 2011) that few steps are needed to
constrain it to Dromaeosauridae.<br>
Sues and Averianov (2004) referred additional material to <i>Itemirus</i>,
describing it as a dromaeosaurid and stating it reaches sizes
comparable to <i>Utahraptor</i>. Nessov (1995) referred the maxilla
CCMGE 600/12457 to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, but it was reidentified as
dromaeosaurid by Averianov and Sues (2012) and described as cf. <i>Itemirus</i>
by Sues and Averianov (2014). Tanaka et al. (2021) referred it to their
new carcharodontosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Ulughbegsaurus</span>
along with maxillary fragment ZIN PH 357/16 that was described as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Itemirus</span> by Sues and
Averianov.  CCMGE 456/12457 was figured by Nessov as a segnosaur,
but later reidentified as <i>cf. Itemirus</i> by Sues and Averianov
(2014). The unnumbered maxilla and teeth listed above were identified
as Deinonychosauria and Dromaeosauridae by Nessov. The maxilla is
described as shorter and wider than <i>Deinonychus</i>, though not
mentioned by Sues and Averianov (2014) as no obviously corresponding
specimen was found, while the teeth (including that in plate 1 figure 4
of Nessov, assigned to cf. <i>Itemirus</i> by Sues and Averianov,
2014) were described as small. While Sues and Averianov (2004) refer
"several braincases" to <i>Itemirus</i> in their abstract, only the
holotype was noted in the resulting publication. Sues (pers. comm.
2014) stated these were fragments that showed few diagnostic features
once prepared, so their identification remains uncertain. ZIN PH 73/16
was mislabeled ZIN PH 2273/16 in Sues and Averianov's (2014) figure.
The final publication of the Bissekty dromaeosaurid was Sues and
Averianov's (2014), which tentatively referred all material to <i>Itemirus</i>
because "there are no morphological differences among the few
comparable remains." Based on the limited materal, this must remain
provisional. Several of the characters in this publication are miscoded
(dorsal tympanic recess is present; supratemporal fossa border is
simply curved; frontal's postorbital process not sharply demarcated;
dentary has a labial groove; posterior dorsal parapophyses are not on
prominent pedicles; hyposphenes are not separated), most favoring a
dromaeosaurid identity. Given these miscodings, Sues and Averianov's
recovery of <i>Itemirus</i> as a dromaeosaurine more derived than <i>Tsaagan</i>
may be questioned. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- <i>Achillobator</i> was discovered in 1989 and
described in an obscure Mongolian journal before its time. Norell and
Clark originally intended to publish it in American Museum Novitates
with a comparative analysis. Unfortunately, it was released in an
extremely preliminary form in Contributions of the Mongolian-American
Paleontological Project without their knowledge based on a draft left
in Mongolia in 1997 (Turner et al., 2012). Indeed, the section "Habits
and affinities of dromaeosaurian dinosaurs" was neither written nor
seen by Norell and Clark prior to publication. <br>
Perle
et al. (1999) say the locality was in the "Khongil Formation" and the
"Bayn Shireh" or "Bayan Shireh" Formation.  The holotype "was
found as an associated but disarticulated skeleton" and "At the
Burkhant only the holotype skeleton was collected", so it is unlikely
this is a chimaera as Burnham et al. (2000) have supposed. They stated
that the maxilla, ilium, ischium and caudal vertebrae share no unique
characters with dromaeosaurids. This is obviously not true, as the
maxilla has fused interdental plates and a dorsally placed maxillary
fenestra; the caudal vertebrae have elongate prezygapophyses and
chevrons; while the ilium has a concave anterior edge that slants
posteroventrally.<br>
The
authors first claim only "two posterior dorsals" are preserved but
later say "Only a few dorsal vertebrae are preserved, probably relating
to middle and posterior positions."  The text states "Only a
single. nearly complete.rib is preserved", but two are figured. The rib
the text mentions is supposed to be either "the anteriormost dorsal. or
the last cervical rib", but the two pictured come from the mid-anterior
and posterior portion of the dorsal column.  Perle et al. first
say "three midcaudal vertebrae are preserved" but later explains "Seven
isolated caudal vertebrae are preserved. One of these probably belongs
to the transitional series of caudals, the others to the posterior
caudals."  Measurements for eight vertebrae are hand written (by
Norell?) in the left margin of page 19 (as listed above), but the text
later states "The total length of the four successive posterior series
of vertebrae is 300.3mm (75.5,75.2,74.9,74.7)" which are different
lengths.    A radius is figured, but not described.  The
supposed pedal ungual II is actually a manual ungual (Senter et al.,
2004; Senter, 2007).  The text states "The proximal phalanges are
longest in digit III and IV", but neither phalanges III-1 or IV-1 were
reported.  Hand written text on page 59 lists measurements for
manual and pedal phalanges, which notes pedal phalanges I-1, II-2 and
manual ungual II may be II-2, III-3 and manual ungual III respectively.<br>
The only comment regarding its placement within the Dromaeosauridae in
the original description is in the abstract, where the authors state
"this maniraptoran dinosaur is closely related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus albertensis</span>." 
The TWiG analyses (Norell et al., 2001 and variations) have always
recovered <i>Achillobator</i> as a dromaeosaurid, generally in a
polytomy with the non-microraptorian taxa. Turner et al. (2007) and
several other more recent variations have added many characters
relevant to dromaeosaurids and found <i>Achillobator</i> to be most
closely related to <i>Utahraptor</i>, <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> and <i>Adasaurus</i>.
Senter et al. (2004) and Senter (2007) both found <i>Achillobator</i>
to be the sister taxon to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> + <i>Utahraptor</i>. <i>Adasaurus</i>
was more basal in both. In addition, Britt et al. (2001) indicate new
materials of <i>Utahraptor</i> share characters with <i>Achillobator</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The name <i>Utahraptor</i> was first used in a press
release from Kirkland and Dinamation International Society (Olshevsky,
2000) and subsequently published in several articles in July 1992 (e.g.
Browne, 1992). Its species name was originally going to be <i>U.
spielbergi</i>, but Steven Spielberg's lawyers apparently objected
(Bakker pers. comm. to Tegowski, 1996). That name has only been
published in a children's magazine and merchandise, which of course
lacked a proper description. Once the taxon was properly published,
Kirkland et al. (1993) spelled the species name <i>ostrommaysi</i>,
but this was emmended by Olshevsky (1993) to <i>ostrommaysorum</i>
"because it honors two persons" (Olshevsky, 2000). However, Costa and
David (2019) noted that the ICZN actually says (Article 31.1.2) "A
species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case, formed directly
from <span style="font-weight: bold;">a modern personal name</span> is
to be formed by adding to the stem of that name -i if the personal name
is that of a man, -orum if of men ...", and <span style="font-style: italic;">ostrommaysi</span>
was technically formed from two modern personal names (Ostrom and
Mays), not a modern personal name.  Thus according to Costa and
David "Under Art. 11.3, it has to be regarded as an arbitrary
combination of letters, and not a correctly formed name in the genitive
case according to Arts. 31.1.1 or 31.1.2. For this reason, it is deemed
to be preserved unaltered and it is not subject to a justified
emendation."  This makes <span style="font-style: italic;">ostrommaysorum</span>
an unjustified emendation, which could be preserved if it were in
prevailing usage (ICZN Articles 33.2.3.1 and 33.3.1).  But the
authors found it was only "used in 28 of the 57 works that mention the
taxon, representing a percentage of ca. 49%, which is far from
representing a "substantial majority"", cementing <span style="font-style: italic;">ostrommaysi</span> as the correct name for
now.  The name <i>Utahraptor</i> "oweni" has also appeared online
in various places but is probably a mistake for <i>Valdoraptor oweni</i>.
<br>
The type material was discovered in 1975 (BYU material) and 1991-1992
(CEU material), but only described in 1993. The other CEU type material
may belong to the same individual as the holotype (Kirkland et al.,
2008). A supposed lacrimal (CEU 184v.83) was also a paratype, but was
later found to be a postorbital from the ankylosaur <i>Gastonia</i>
(Britt et al., 2001). Britt et al. also state a previously identified
surangular is actually a long bone fragment, but no surangular was
identified in the original description. Turner et al. (2012) consider
this bone to be a surangular or partial splenial. Britt et al. further
determined that the supposed manual unguals BYU 9438, BYU 13068 and CEU
184v.294 are actually pedal unguals, which was confirmed by Senter
(2007a). <br>
New material was announced by Britt et al. (2001) and Chure et al.
(2007) in abstracts, but has yet to be described in detail. This
consists of one individual from the Yellow Cat (=Gaston) Quarry (CEU
coll.) and at least eight from the Dalton Wells Quarry (&gt;240
elements in the BYU coll.). Anatomical information on these specimens
can be gleaned from the matrices of Senter (2007b), Longrich and Currie
(2009) and Turner et al. (2012), the latter of which also illustrate a
few elements. Of particular interest are caudal vertebrae about twice
as long as those belonging to a specimen with a 565 mm long femur. If
this turns out to be correct and not due to misidentification or
unusual proportions, it could indicate individuals over ten meters
long. Turner et al. considered the ischium BYU 10978 to be from an
ornithomimid instead, based on the proximally placed obturator process,
lack of a lateral ridge, rodlike shaft and semicircular proximolateral
scar. Yet <i>Achillobator</i> also has a proximally placed obturator
process and the proximolateral scar is common among theropods. It is
here provisionally retained in <i>Utahraptor</i> pending its
description.<br>
Kirkland et al. (2011) mention two specimens, of which at least the
large one resembles <i>Utahraptor</i> in its premaxillary teeth,
surangular and astragalus. The small individual has serrationless
dentary teeth that are procumbant anteriorly. The large individual has
large nuchal and sagittal crests on the braincase, deep and pendant
paroccipital processes, larghe olfactory bulbs and serrations on the
first dentary tooth.<br>
