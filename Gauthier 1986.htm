<p><b><font size="+2">Gauthier, 1986. Saurischian monophyly and the origin of 
  birds. Memoirs of the Californian Academy of Sciences 8, 1-55.</font></b></p>
<p>This paper was the first numerical cladistic analysis of Mesozoic theropod, 
  and as such was highly influential. For instance, it formed the basis for the 
  phylogeny used in The Dinosauria (Weishampel et al., 1990). Important clades 
  originating here include Tetanurae, a Coelurosauria including taxa closer to 
  birds than to carnosaurs, and Maniraptora.</p>
<p><b>Phylogeny</b>-</p>
<p>Gauthier's illustrated phylogeny is as follows. Note it excludes <i>Hulsanpes</i>, 
  which can be placed anywhere in Maniraptora according to his codings.</p>

<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Outgroup- Gauthier's outgroup includes Pseudosuchia (=Crurotarsi), Ornithosuchidae 
  (now viewed as a crurotarsan clade), <i>Euparkeria</i> (viewed as an avemetatarsalian 
  by Gauthier, but now placed outside Archosauria), <i>Lagosuchus</i> (based largely 
  on <i>Marasuchus</i>), Pterosauria and Herrerasauridae (now viewed as a saurischian 
  and possible theropod clade). <br>
  Elmisauridae- Gauthier includes <i>Chirostenotes</i>, <i>Macrophalangia</i> 
  (a junior synonym of <i>Chirostenotes</i>) and <i>Elmisaurus</i> in this family, 
  but excludes <i>Caenagnathus</i> which is now known to be the mandible of <i>Chirostenotes</i>. 
  This clade is now called Caenagnathidae.<br>
  Caenagnathidae- Gauthier includes <i>Caenagnathus</i> (the mandible of <i>Chirostenotes</i>) 
  and <i>Oviraptor</i> (including the yet unnamed <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>Citipati</i> 
  specimen IGM 100/42) in this family, but excludes <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  which he places in Ornithomimidae. <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> is here included, 
  <i>Caenagnathus</i> excluded and the OTU referred to as Oviraptoridae.<br>
  Ceratosauria- This includes <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and several coelophysoids- <i>Megapnosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Segisaurus</i>, <i>Sarcosaurus</i>, <i>Dilophosaurus</i> 
  and the not yet named <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>, but excludes 
  abelisaurs. Of the latter, <i>Indosaurus</i> and <i>Indosuchus</i> were included 
  in Carnosauria while <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> was included in Ornithomimidae. <i>Liliensternus</i> 
  and <i>Procompsognathus</i> were coded separately.<br>
  Carnosauria- This included not only <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  but also tyrannosauroids (<i>Alectrosaurus, Dryptosaurus, Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, 
  Nanotyrannus</i> [= <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>?], <i>Alioramus, Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i>) 
  and two taxa now recognized as abelisaurids (<i>Indosaurus</i>, <i>Indosuchus</i>). 
  The abelisaurids are here ignored, as they are not codable for virtually any 
  characters anyway.<br>
  Ornithomimidae- This included all ornithomimosaurs (<i>Archaeornithomimus, Dromiceiomimus, 
  Ornithomimus, O? sedens, Struthiomimus, Gallimimus, Garudimimus, Deinocheirus</i>) 
  as well as the unrelated <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  (neither of which was included in my codings of the OTU).<br>
  Deinonychosauria- This included its current content of Troodontidae (<i>Saurornithoides, 
  Zanabazar, Troodon</i>) and Dromaeosauridae (<i>Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus, 
  Velociraptor, Adasaurus</i>), though <i>Saurornitholestes</i> was coded separately.<br>
  Avialae- This clade was equivalent to my usage, but only <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, 
  Hesperornithes, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and Aves were recognized at the time.</p>
<p><b>Coding issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> and <b>oviraptorids</b> (IGM 100/42) have premaxillary 
  subnarial processes with elongate nasal contact. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> are 
  polymorphic, with the derived state found in <i>Velociraptor</i>, but not <i>Saurornithoides</i>, 
  <i>Zanabazar</i> or <i>Troodon</i>.</p>
<p>2. Gauthier's <b>outgroups</b> (<i>Herrerasaurus</i>, <i><b>Lesothosaurus</b></i><b>, 
  <i>Emausaurus</i></b>, etc.) all have supratemporal fossae on their frontals, 
  as do other dinosaurian outgroups (<i>Silesaurus</i>, <i>Scleromochlus</i>). 
  <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i>' skull is probably sphenosuchian, so cannot be 
  coded for cranial characters. <i>Ornitholestes</i> and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  both have such fossae as well, unlike Gauthier's codings of unknown and absent.</p>
<p>3. This character uses both neck length vs. presacral length (&gt;36%), but 
  also cervical 6 compared to dorsal 2 length (&gt;20% longer). These are correlated, 
  but may also not always be true in any taxon. <i>Procompsognathus, Liliensternus, 
  Coelurus, Microvenator, Chirostenotes</i>, oviraptorids and deinonychosaurs 
  have elongate necks as well, so should be coded as derived instead of unknown. 
  This is also true of <i>Herrerasaurus</i>, one of Gauthier's <b>outgroups</b>.</p>
<p>4. Gauthier's <b>outgroup</b> <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has laterally placed axial 
  postzygapophyses, while the axis of <i><b>Coelurus</b></i> is unpreserved and 
  that of <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is too poorly preserved to code. Oviraptorids 
  such as IGM 100/42 have the derived state however.</p>
<p>5. Again <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has anterior cervical epipophyses as do 
  basal <b>ornithischians</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>, <i>Lesothosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Scelidosaurus</i>). <i>Liliensternus</i> also has epipophyses, while the 
  condition in <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> is unpreserved. Among coelurosaurs, 
  <i>Ornitholestes</i>, oviraptorids (e.g. IGM 100/42) and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  have epipophyses.</p>
<p>6. Yet again the <b>outgroup</b> <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has dorsal hyposphene-hypantrum 
  articulations. Among coelurosaurs, <i>Coelurus</i>, <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> have them.</p>
<p>7. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has elongate hands (&gt;45% of humeral+radial length) 
  based on new finds, as do pterosaurs, so the <b>outgroup</b> is coded as apomorphic. 
  With the recent placement of heterodontosaurids as basal ornithischians and 
  <i>Eocursor</i>, it's known <b>ornithischians</b> had elongate hands basally. 
  Based on the length of incomplete manus, <i>Liliensternus</i>, <i>Procompsognathus</i>, 
  <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Coelurus</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Microvenator</i> 
  and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> also have elongate manus.</p>
<p>8. The manus Gauthier used to code <i>Ornitholestes</i>' digit length (AMNH 
  587) is now referred to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>, leaving <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  unknown for this character. The basal <b>ornithomimosaur</b> <i>Deinocheirus</i> 
  has a longer third digit than second digit, making that OTU polymorphic. Published 
  remains of <i><b>Saurornitholestes</b></i> are still too fragmentary to determine 
  its condition.</p>
<p>9. This character is a composite, as metacarpals IV and V will not necessarily 
  both lay on the ventral sides of III and IV respectively in a taxon. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> 
  has the derived condition, as does <i>Procompsognathus</i> for IV at least, 
  though again the misattributed manus of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> means it 
  should be coded as unknown. </p>
<p>10. This character is a composite of several features (manual digit I more 
  robust than digit II; manual ungual I larger than II; metacarpal I 50% or less 
  of metacarpal II length; distal condyles of metacarpal I markedly asymmetrical; 
  phalanx I-1 longer than metacarpal I and is the longest phalanx). <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> 
  has features 4, 5 and 6 but lacks the others. <i><b>Heterodontosaurus</b></i> 
  has characters 2 and 4. A basal <b>sauropodomorph</b> such as <i>Efraasia</i> 
  has 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. <i>Dilophosaurus</i> has 2, sometimes 3, 4 and 5. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  certainly lacks 1 and 3, but does have 4. <i>Procompsognathus</i> has 1, 3 and 
  5 but lacks 6. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> has 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. Thus all of these 
  taxa should be polymorphic. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> has at least 1, 2, 4 
  and 5, so is either apomorphic or polymorphic. <i>Compsognathus</i> has 1, 2, 
  3 and 5, so is coded polymorphic instead of unknown. <i>Coelurus</i> lacks at 
  least 1, but is kept scored unknown. Basal <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> like <i>Deinocheirus</i> 
  have 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 so are coded polymorphic. <i>Microvenator</i> has at least 
  4 and 5, but is kept unknown. <i><b>Elmisaurus</b></i> and <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i> 
  have 4 and 5. Basal oviraptorids like IGM 100/42 have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, so 
  are correctly coded as apomorphic. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> such as <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  and <i>Velociraptor</i> have 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, so are coded as polymorphic. 
  Basal <b>avialans</b> like <i>Archaeopteryx</i> have 3, 4, 5 and 6, so are also 
  coded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>11. This character also consists of two parts- reduced mandibular symphysis; 
  reduced overlap of dentary with postdentary bones. The <b>outgroup</b> <i>Herrerasaurus</i> 
  has these features based on recently described material. <i>Liliensternus</i>, 
  <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>, <b>ornithomimids</b>, <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  and <b>oviraptorids</b> lack mandibular kinesis. <i>Ornitholestes</i> appears 
  to have an intermandibular joint however. Gauthier's <b>ceratosaurs</b> are 
  polymorphic, as <i>Megapnosaurus</i> and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> have a tight fit 
  between the splenial and prearticular suggesting no kinesis, but <i>Ceratosaurus</i> 
  differs. <b>Avialae</b> is also polymorphic, with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> probably 
  lacking a joint while hesperornithids and <i>Ichthyornis</i> have one.</p>
<p>12. The <b>outgroup</b> <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has a dorsally exposed lacrimal, 
  as do basal <b>sauropodomorphs</b> like <i>Efraasia</i>. The skull of <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> 
  is probably incorrectly referred. The condition in <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  can be inferred as derived from its frontal morphology. </p>
<p>13. What Gauthier calls a maxillary fenestra is now termed a promaxillary fenestra. 
  It is now known for both <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> and <i><b>Heterodontosaurus</b></i>. 
  Tykoski codes it as lacking in <i>Liliensternus</i>, while ceratosaurs are not 
  coded as polymorphic since its absence in the derived <i>Coelophysis</i> and 
  <i>Megapnosaurus</i> is most parsimoniously a reversal. <i>Caenagnathus</i> 
  is now known to lack maxillary fenestrae, while <i>Saurornitholestes</i> has 
  one. Within deinonychosaurs, troodontids known to Gauthier (<i>Saurornitholestes, 
  Zanabazar, Troodon</i>) lack promaxillary fenestrae, while dromaeosaurids (<i>Deinonychus, 
  Velociraptor</i>) have one. Thus <b>deinonychosaurs</b> are polymorphic.</p>
<p>14. Fused vomera are plesiomorphic for <b>ornithischians</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Lesothosaurus</i>). The skull of <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> is probably 
  incorrectly referred. The vomera are also fused in <i>Ornitholestes</i>, while 
  <b>deinonychosaurs</b> and <b>avialans</b> are polymorphic (fused in <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, unfused in <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>). 
</p>
<p>15. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b>, Liliensternus, Ornitholestes</i> and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  have an expanded ectopterygoid with a ventral fossa. The basal <b>sauropodomorph</b> 
  <i>Pantydraco</i> does as well, making sauropodomorphs polymorphic. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  lack the fossa and expansion however.</p>
<p>16. This is a composite character, as odontoid notch width and occipital fossa 
  size are not necessarily correlated. <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> have a broad odontoid notch, unlike <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, making 
  <b>Ceratosauria</b> polyphyletic. </p>
<p>17. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has the broadly concave axial intercentrum 
  as in theropods.</p>
<p>18. <i>Procompsognathus, Liliensternus, Ornitholestes, Chirostenotes</i> and 
  oviraptorids have presacral pleurocoels. The sauropodomorph <i>Pantydraco</i> 
  and pterosaurs do as well, making both <b>Sauropodomorpha</b> and the <b>outgroup</b> 
  polymorphic.</p>
<p>19. <i><b>Scleromochlus</b></i><b>, pterosaurs</b>, <b>ornithischians</b>, 
  <i>Liliensternus, Ornitholestes, Chirostenotes</i>, oviraptorids and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  have at least four sacrals.</p>
<p>20. This is another composite character, incorporating distally reduced caudal 
  transverse processes, elongate prezygapophyses and dorsoventrally flattened 
  chevrons. <b>Herrerasaurids</b> have elongate prezygapophyses as well (as noted 
  by Gauthier for <i>Staurikosaurus</i>). <i>Ceratosaurus</i> lacks them though, 
  making Gauthier's <b>Ceratosauria</b> polymorphic. <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  have a transition point, while <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i> and 
  oviraptorids lack one (the latter are stated to have one by Gauthier but coded 
  as unknown).</p>
<p>21. <b>Ceratosauria</b> should be polymorphic as <i>Ceratosaurus</i> lacks 
  ossified distal carpals while coelophysoids are correctly coded as having an 
  enlarged carpal block. <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> have 
  an enlarged carpal block, while ornithomimosaurs lack one (which they are stated 
  to by Gauthier, but coded as unknown). </p>
<p>22. <b>Pterosaurs and <i>Herrerasaurus</i></b> have reduced manual digit V, 
  as does <i>Procompsognathus</i>. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' more complete 
  manus belongs to <i>Tanycolagreus</i> and the holotype is too incomplete to 
  judge this character. <i><b>Saurornitholestes</b></i>' described manus is also 
  too incomplete.</p>
<p>23. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has a reduced manual digit IV, while <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  and <i><b>Saurornitholestes</b></i> are unknown as for the previous character.</p>
<p>24. While this character is stated as &quot;manus with elongate penultimate 
  phalanges&quot;, it is best understood as only pertaining to digit II, since 
  digit I was covered in character 10 and digit III is covered in the next character. 
  Pterosaurs, <i>Herrerasaurus</i>, <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>, <i>Eocursor</i> 
  and <i>Efraasia</i> have elongate phalanx II-2, making the <b>outgroup</b>, 
  <b>Ornithischia</b> and <b>Sauropodomorpha</b> polymorphic. Meanwhile, <i>Dilophosaurus</i> 
  has a short phalanx making <b>Ceratosauria</b> polymorphic. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  and <i><b>Saurornitholestes</b></i> are unknown again. <i>Coelurus</i> has the 
  derived state and <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i> is polymorphic. <b>Avialae</b> 
  should also be polymorphic, as <i>Ichthyornis</i> and numerous other more basal 
  taxa not known by Gauthier have short distal phalanges.</p>
<p>25. Pterosaurs, <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> and <i>Eocursor</i> have manual phalanx 
  III-3 longer than III-1 or III-2, making the <b>outgroup</b> and <b>Ornithischia</b> 
  polymorphic. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown again.</p>
<p>26. This character is another composite- manual unguals enlarged, compressed, 
  pointed, recurved and with large flexor tubercles. Moreover, an enlarged manual 
  ungual I was covered by character 10. Novas (1993) revised this to only apply 
  to digits II and III since sauropodomorphs and <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> have 
  the characters on digit I. Taken this way, <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i><b> and 
  pterosaurs</b> still exhibit the character. <i><b>Heterodontosaurus</b></i>' 
  and <i><b>Efraasia</b></i>'s manual ungual IIs would seem to qualify as well, 
  except the latter has a low flexor tubercle. Tyrannosaurids and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  have rather uncompressed unguals, ornithurine birds have smaller unguals than 
  other theropods, non-<i>Deinocheirus</i> ornithomimosaurs (mentioned by Gauthier 
  as lacking the characters, but coded unknown), <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  and many avialans have less curved unguals, and most ornithomimosaurs have low 
  flexor tubercles. Considering this, Ornithomimosauria, <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  and <b>Avialae</b> should be coded as polymorphic. <i><b>Coelurus</b></i> does 
  not preserve manual unguals.</p>
<p>27. <i><b>Scleromochlus</b></i><b> and pterosaurs</b> have a long preacetabular 
  process as do <b>ornithischians</b> (noted by Gauthier but coded as absent). 
  Among theropods, it is also present in <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.</p>
<p>28. A deeply concave brevis fossa is absent in <i>Microvenator</i>, <b>oviraptorids</b> 
  and most <b>deinonychosaurs</b> (e.g. <i>Adasaurus</i>, <i>Deinonychus</i>, 
  <i>Velociraptor</i>) and is uncertain in <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i>. </p>
<p>29. Gauthier noted <b>pterosaurs</b> have non-sigmoidal femora. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> 
  and <b>carnosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier seem to be polymorphic as some (<i>Dilophosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Allosaurus</i>) have sigmoidal femora while others (<i>Ceratosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>) don't. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  also has a sigmoidal femur. </p>
<p>30. This is a composite character, including both the how closely appressed 
  the tibia and fibula are, and the presence of a fibular crest on the tibia. 
  Gauthier notes <b>pterosaurs (and <i>Scleromochlus</i>)</b> have appressed lower 
  limb elements, as do <b>ornithischians</b>. As both of these groups lack a fibular 
  crest, they are coded as polymorphic. <b>Sauropodomorphs</b> are polymorphic 
  for the presence of a fibular crest, as <i>Saturnalia</i> has one. The tibia 
  of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown, while <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  have the crest. Sereno and Wild indicate <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> cannot 
  be coded for this character.</p>
<p>31. Elongate and narrow metatarsi are present in <i><b>Scleromochlus</b></i><b>, 
  pterosaurs, <i>Lagosuchus</i></b> and most other non-dinosaurian avemetatarsalians. 
  This is also true of basal <b>ornithischians</b>, basal <b>sauropodomorphs</b> 
  and <i>Coelurus</i>. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> and <b>carnosaurs</b> (both sensu Gauthier) 
  are polymorphic as <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  have robust metatarsi. </p>
<p>32. <b>Sauropodomorphs</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Efraasia</i> has a symmetrical 
  pes. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier are also polymorphic, as <i>Dilophosaurus</i> 
  has an asymmetrical pes while <i>Megapnosaurus</i>' is symmetrical. <i>Liliensternus</i>' 
  and <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i>' pes are asymmetrical. <i>Hulsanpes</i>' 
  pes is also asymmetrical based on the short metatarsal II. </p>
<p>33. In the outgroup, <i>Scleromochlus</i>, pterosaurs and <i>Lagosuchus</i> 
  lack phalanges on pedal digit V, making the <b>outgroup</b> polymorphic. Basal 
  sauropodomorphs <i>Saturnalia</i> and <i>Pantydraco</i> lack phalanges as well, 
  making <b>Sauropodomorpha</b> basally derived for this character. </p>
<p>34. <i><b>Liliensternus</b></i> does not preserve the first pedal digit, so 
  whether its metatarsal I contacts the tarsus is unknown. </p>
<p>35. Thin-walled long bones are present in pterosaurs and <i>Marasuchus</i> 
  in the <b>outgroup</b>, making it polymorphic. <i>Anchisaurus</i> and material 
  referred to <i>Thecodontosaurus</i> is also hollowed comparably to theropods, 
  making <b>Sauropodomorpha</b> possibly basally derived. </p>
<p>36. <b>Ornithischia</b> was coded as having an enlarged fang-like tooth in 
  the anterior dentary, but while heterodontosaurids have this, <i>Pisanosaurus</i> 
  and other taxa except for pachycephalosaurs do not. They are thus recoded as 
  polymorphic here. The basal sauropodomorph <i>Panphagia</i> has a fang-like 
  tooth, making <b>sauropodomorphs</b> properly coded polymorphic. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> 
  sensu Gauthier are also polymorphic, as he notes (though he codes them as plesiomorphic), 
  since <i>Ceratosaurus</i> has no fang-like tooth. <b>Elmisauridae</b> is coded 
  as lacking fang-like teeth by Gauthier based on <i>Richardoestesia</i> which 
  was originally incorrectly referred to <i>Chirostenotes</i>. <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  is now known to have toothless jaws. <i>Saurornitholestes</i> is now known to 
  lack a fang-like tooth.</p>
<p>37. This is another composite character, involving both the maxillary fenestra's 
  size and anteroposterior placement. <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i>' skull is 
  probably incorrectly referred, so it is rescored as unknown. <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  is now known to lack large maxillary fenestrae, while <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  has them. <b>Avialae</b> should be polymorphic, as Hesperornithes and Aves lack 
  maxillary fenestrae. Regarding placement, <i>Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, Struthiomimus, 
  Dromiceiomimus</i> and <i>Saurornithoides</i> have fenestrae placed at the anterior 
  edge of their antorbital fossae, but are also derived within their respective 
  clades.</p>
<p>38. <i>Scleromochlus</i> has an antorbital tooth row, making the <b>outgroup</b> 
  polymorphic. <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> is again unknown for this cranial 
  character. <i>Saurornitholestes</i>' maxilla shows its tooth row is antorbital. 
</p>
<p>39. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> do not have axial spine tables (e.g. <i>Gallimimus</i>), 
  contra Gauthier. They are also absent in <i>Microvenator</i> and oviraptorids 
  (e.g. IGM 100/42), but present in <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.</p>
<p>40. This character involves the proximalness of the caudal transition point, 
  and thus correlates with character 20 involving the presence of the transition 
  point. All taxa coded as 0 for 20 should thus be coded unknown for this character 
  (including Ornithischia and Sauropodomorpha), to stop weighting the condition 
  unequally. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has a proximally placed transition point 
  (22 caudals with transverse processes), so is coded as apomorphic. In actuality, 
  coelophysoids like <i>Megapnosaurus</i> are no less developed than carnosaurs 
  like <i>Allosaurus</i> in the various features used to define this character. 
  <i>Megapnosaurus</i>' transition point is more proximally placed (caudal 21) 
  and its mid caudal vertebrae are more elongate than <i>Allosaurus</i>, with 
  lower neural spines, more reduced transverse processes and equally elongate 
  prezygapophyses. <i>Dilophosaurus</i> is similar (last transverse process on 
  caudal 19, last neural spine on caudal 22). While <i>Megapnosaurus</i> is reported 
  to lack the modified hatchet-like chevrons of <i>Allosaurus</i> and many coelurosaurs, 
  <i>Dilophosaurus</i> is said to have them, and <i>Compsognathus</i> lacks them 
  but is still coded 1 by Gauthier. Thus <b>ceratosaurs</b> are here coded as 
  polymorphic. <i>Ornitholestes</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> both have proximally 
  placed transition points.</p>
<p>41. The <b>outgroup</b> <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has a strap-like scapula. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> 
  sensu Gauthier should be polymorphic, as <i>Ceratosaurus</i> has a strap-like 
  scapula. <b>Carnosauria</b> sensu Gauthier should be polymorphic as well, since 
  tyrannosaurids have highly expanded distal scapulae (as mentioned by Gauthier, 
  though he codes the OTU 0). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown, as it does 
  not preserve a scapula. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is also polymorphic, with 
  the two specimens differing. Oviraptorids such as <i>Oviraptor</i> and IGM 100/42 
  are apomorphic, as is <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.</p>
<p>42. <i>Procompsognathus</i> has a rounded posterior coracoid border, while 
  <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i>, oviraptorids like IGM 100/42, and 
  <i>Saurornitholestes</i> have an elongate posterior process.</p>
<p>43. This character (manus &gt;66% of humerus+radius length) is correlated with 
  7 (manus &gt;45% of humerus+radius length), so taxa scored 0 for 7 should be 
  scored unknown for this character. <b>Carnosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier should be 
  polymorphic, as some (<i>Allosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Albertosaurus</i>) have 
  elongate manus while others (<i>Gorgosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i>) have short manus. 
  While <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> are coded as having long manus, Gauthier notes 
  is sometimes shorter than 66% of the humerus+radius length, and indeed this 
  seems to be the plesiomorphic state (<i>Deinocheirus, Struthiomimus, Gallimimus</i>) 
  with only <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> having a long manus. <i>Compsognathus</i> has 
  a long manus now that the metacarpal and phalangeal identities are known. Based 
  on their incomplete manus, <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Procompsognathus</i> 
  have short manus, while <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Microvenator</i> have long manus.</p>
<p>44. <b>Carnosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier are polymorphic, since tyrannosaurids 
  (<i>Daspletosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i>) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> have short 
  articulations for metacarpal II on metacarpal I. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  is plesiomorphic for this character, as its articulated manus is referred to 
  <i>Tanycolagreus</i> and its holotypic metacarpal I has a facet for metacarpal 
  II shorter than half its length. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are polymorphic as 
  <i>Deinocheirus</i> has a short surface. <i>Microvenator</i> and <i><b>Elmisaurus</b></i> 
  are plesiomorphic.</p>
<p>45. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown due to a lack of manual material. 
  <b>Carnosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier are polymorphic, as <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  and tyrannosaurids seem to have little overlap between metacarpals II and III. 
  <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are also polymorphic, as <i>Deinocheirus</i> lacks much 
  overlap. <i>Compsognathus</i> is plesiomorphic based on the articulated French 
  specimen. <b>Oviraptorids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Oviraptor</i> lacks the 
  character while <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> has it. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> are 
  plesiomorphic based on the articulated manus of <i>Velociraptor</i> while <b>avialans</b> 
  are polymorphic since <i>Archaeopteryx</i> can exhibit both conditions.</p>
<p>46. <i>Procompsognathus</i> has a well developed metacarpal IV, while <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>, 
  <b>&quot;elmisaurids&quot;</b> and <i><b>Saurornitholestes</b></i> have manus 
  which are too fragmentary to exclude the possibility digit IV was present.</p>
<p>47. <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> does not preserve the ischium, contra Ostrom, 
  so cannot be evaluated for the presence of an obturator process. <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  has an obturator process, and <b>Avialae</b> should be coded polymorphic as 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has one.</p>
<p>48. The outgroup is correctly coded as lacking a pubic foot, as herrerasaurids' 
  condition involves a twisted distal pubic flange instead of an actual posteriorly 
  projecting foot. <i>Procompsognathus</i> also lacks a pubic foot, while <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  does not preserve the distal pubis. <b>Avialae</b> should be polymorphic, as 
  Hesperornithes and Aves lack a pubic foot.</p>
<p>49. <b>Ornithischians</b> (heterodontosaurids, <i>Lesothosaurus</i>, thyreophorans) 
  primitively have a winglike anterior trochanter. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier 
  should be polymorphic, as <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and some <i>Megapnosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> individuals have winglike anterior trochanters. <i>Coelurus</i> 
  also has one, while <i><b>Microvenator</b></i>, <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i>, 
  <b>Deinonychosauria</b> (<i>Saurornithoides, Troodon, Deinonychus, Adasaurus, 
  Velociraptor</i>) and <b>Avialae</b> (<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, Hesperornithes, 
  <i>Ichthyornis</i>, Aves) lack the morphology (it is said to be a modified form 
  by Gauthier, who also probably misinterpreted <i>Microvenator</i>'s accessory 
  trochanter). Oviraptorids are polymorphic (winglike in <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>, 
  cylindrical in IGM 100/42 and <i>Conchoraptor</i>). </p>
<p>50. <i>Procompsognathus</i> seems to have a short astragalar ascending process, 
  while <i>Coelurus</i>, oviraptorids such as IGM 100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>, 
  <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <b>Avialae</b> (<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, juvenile Aves) 
  have tall processes. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> and <i><b>Hulsanpes</b></i> 
  lack preserves tibiae or tarsals, so are scored unknown.</p>
<p>51. <i>Ornitholestes</i> and oviraptorids (IGM 100/42, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) have 
  metatarsal IIIs with limited proximal exposure. </p>
<p>52. This is correlated with character 34, so taxa coded 0 for 34 should be 
  coded unknown for 52. <i>Liliensternus</i> does not preseve pedal digit I, so 
  its metatarsal I length is unknown. Contra Gauthier, the metatarsal I of tetanurines 
  does not seem shorter (compared to metatarsal II) than basal avepods. In actuality, 
  <i>Dilophosaurus</i> (38%), <i>Allosaurus</i> (31%), <i>Velociraptor</i> (31-33%) 
  and <i>Deinonychus</i> (32%) have long metatarsals, while <i>Procompsognathus</i> 
  (18%), <i>Megapnosaurus</i> (25%), <i>&quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae</i> (25%), 
  <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (27%), <i>Gorgosaurus</i> (23%), <i>Alectrosaurus</i> 
  (14%), <i>Compsognathus</i> (23-24%), <i>Garudimimus</i> (22%), <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  (22%), IGM 100/42 (24%), <i>Troodon</i> (~15%) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> have 
  short ones. Thus <b>Ceratosauria</b>, <b>Carnosauria</b> and <b>Deinonychosauria</b> 
  are changed to polymorphic,and <i><b>Procompsognathus</b></i> is changed to 
  derived.</p>
<p>53. <b>Carnosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier are polymorphic for the subsidiary palatal 
  fenestra, as tyrannosaurids have one. <b>Oviraptorids</b> (IGM 100/42) lack 
  a fenestra, contra Gauthier. Avialans and <b>deinonychosaurs</b> are polymorphic 
  too, since <i>Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus, Velociraptor</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  has a fenestra but <i>Saurornithoides</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i> and Aves lack 
  one.</p>
<p>54. This character (depth of ectopterygoid fossa) is correlated with character 
  15 (presence of fossa), so all taxa coded 0 for 15 (Ornithischia, Oviraptoridae) 
  should be coded ? for 54. <i>Liliensternus</i> is plesiomorphic. <b>Carnosaurs</b> 
  sensu Gauthier should be polymorphic, as <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids 
  have deep fossae. The depth of <b>ornithomimosaurs</b>' fossae is uncertain.</p>
<p>55. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> should be polymorphic, as <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and coelophysids 
  have cervical ribs fused to their centra. <b>Ornithomimosauria</b> is also polymorphic, 
  as <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> and some <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> 
  individuals have unfused ribs. <b>Avialae</b> is polymorphic as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  lacks fused ribs. Deinonychosauria and Oviraptoridae are polymorphic, while 
  Gauthier codes both as unknown. <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i><b>Coelurus</b></i>, 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i> lack fused ribs, while <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  has them. Gauhier's suggestion maniraptoriforms with unfused ribs may be ontogenetically 
  young may prove correct, and the juvenile <i>Microvenator</i> is not coded for 
  this reason. </p>
<p>56. <i>Lilensternus</i> and <i>Coelurus</i> lack flexed cervical prezygapophyses, 
  while they are present in <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Microvenator</i>, 
  oviraptorid IGM 100/42 and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. </p>
<p>57. <i>Coelurus</i> lacks anterior cervical centra with extremely broad anterior 
  articular surfaces, while <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Microvenator</i>, oviraptorids 
  (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i>, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  have broad surfaces.</p>
<p>58. <b>Ceratosaurs</b> sensu Gauthier (<i>Coelophysis, Megapnosaurus, &quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae, Segisaurus</i>), Carnosauria sensu Gauthier (<i>Allosaurus, Gorgosaurus, 
  Tyrannosaurus</i>), <i>Compsognathus</i> and deinonychosaurs (<i>Velociraptor</i>) 
  have furculae, whereas <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> are unknown thanks to unossified 
  clavicles (they were coded by Gauthier as having furculae based on <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>).</p>
<p>59. Gauthier notes pterosaurs have fused sterna, so the <b>outgroup</b> is 
  coded as polymorphic. <i>Compsognathus</i>, ornithomimosaurs known by Gauthier 
  and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lack ossified sternal plates, so are coded 0. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  were coded as having fused sterna based on <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> by Gauthier. 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>'s condition makes <b>Avialae</b> polymorphic. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  are polymorphic as IGM 100/42 has unfused sterna and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  varies. Deinonychosaurs have unfused sternal plates based on <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  and <i>Adasaurus</i>. Gauthier codes most coelurosaur taxa unknown because he 
  thinks individuals with unfused plates could have been subadults, but with the 
  continued discovery of unfused sternals in almost all coelurosaurs except alvarezsaurids, 
  some <i>Microraptor</i> specimens and pygostylians, this seems unlikely.</p>
<p>60. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> and pterosaurs both have elongate forelimbs (&gt;50% 
  of presacral and hindlimb length), so the <b>outgroup</b> should be coded as 
  polymorphic. Basal <b>ornithischians</b> like <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> (77% 
  and 56% respectively) and basal <b>sauropodomorphs</b> like <i>Efraasia</i> 
  (54% and 64%) have elongate forelimbs, so these clades should be coded as such. 
  Based on their incomplete forelimbs, <i>Procompsognathus</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i> 
  both have short forelimbs, while <i>Coelurus</i> does as well despite its tibial 
  and pedal lengths being estimates. <i>Microvenator</i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  have elongate forelimbs when their lengths are extrapolated from other taxa.</p>
<p>61. This character is another composite, consisting of both metacarpal I length 
  (&lt;33% of metacarpal II) and manus elongation (seven times longer than basally 
  wide across metacarpals I and II). <i>Procompsognathus</i> lacks this character, 
  due to its long metacarpal I. In addition its manus is probably broad based 
  on the length of metacarpal II and phalanx II-1. <i>Compsognathus</i> has a 
  short manus based on new reconstructions, <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' is unknown 
  thanks to its referred manus belonging to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>, and <i>Coelurus</i> 
  has an elongate manus even though ungual II is unpreserved. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic because <i>Deinocheirus</i> and <i>Gallimimus</i> have short 
  manus, while <i>Struthiomimus</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> have elongate ones. 
  While <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> lacks elongate hands, this seems to be secondary 
  based on their presence in <i>Oviraptor</i> and IGM 100/42. One problematic 
  aspect is that the only coelurosaurs known to Gauthier that actually have metacarpal 
  I 33% of metacarpal II length or less are <i>Compsognathus</i>, Avialae and 
  maybe <i>Oviraptor</i>. Others (<i><b>Velociraptor</b></i><b>, IGM 100/42, <i>Deinonych</i></b><i><b>us</b></i><b>, 
  <i>Chirostenotes</i>, <i>Elmisaurus</i>, <i>&quot;Ing</i></b><i><b>enia&quot;</b></i><b>, 
  <i>Conchoraptor</i></b> and ornithomimosaurs) have longer ones. Gauthier notes 
  only ornithomimosaurs in reference to this, and codes them 1 anyway because 
  it is hypothesized to be secondary. This argument is based on their nesting 
  within Coelurosauria though, which is a result of the analysis as opposed to 
  an a priori assumption, so cannot be used for coding purposes. Thus all coelurosaurs 
  except for avialans are coded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>62. This character is correlated with character 25, since phalanx III-3 must 
  be longer than III-1 or III-2 to be longer than both combined. Thus taxa scored 
  as 0 for 25 (Ornithischia and Sauropodomorpha) should be scored unknown for 
  this one. Gauthier states pterosaurs also have manual phalanx III-3 longer than 
  phalanges III-1 and III-2 combined, but the basal <i>Preondactylus</i> and <i>Peteinosaurus</i> 
  do not, so the outgroup is best left as plesiomorphic. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Deinocheirus</i> lacks the character. <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i><b>, 
  <i>Elmisaurus</i></b> and <b>oviraptorids</b> (<i>Oviraptor</i>, IGM 100/42, 
  <i>Conchoraptor</i>, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) lack the character as well, 
  while <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown (and even the <i>Tanycolagreus</i> 
  manus lacks it, contra Gauthier).</p>
<p>63. <i>Scleromochlus</i> and pterosaurs have reduced fourth trochanters, so 
  the <b>outgroup</b> is scored as polymorphic. <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Coelurus</i> 
  have prominent fourth trochanters, while <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  and oviraptorids (e.g. IGM 100/42, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) lack one. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Adasaurus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> have well developed 
  fourth trochanters.</p>
<p>64. While Gauthier calls this character &quot;moundlike greater trochanter&quot;, 
  he is really referencing the posterior trochanter. <i>Coelurus, Ornitholestes, 
  Compsognathus</i>, <b>ornithomimosaurs</b>, <i><b>Microvenator</b></i> and oviraptorids 
  (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor, &quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) lack posterior trochanters. 
  Among <b>Avialae</b>, Hesperornithes, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and Aves lack the structure, 
  so they should be coded as polymorphic. While <i>Adasaurus</i> lacks a posterior 
  trochanter, this is probably a derived condition within Deinonychosauria (present 
  in <i>Saurornithoides, Troodon, Velociraptor</i> and <i>Deinonychus</i>).</p>
<p>65. This character (ornithomimoid or albertosauroid astragalar ascending process) 
  is correlated with character 50 (allosauroid, ornithomimoid or albertosauroid 
  process), so all taxa coded as 0 for 50 are coded unknown for 65. This includes 
  the outgroup, Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, Ceratosauria and <i>Liliensternus</i>. 
  <b>Carnosauria</b> is polymorphic, as tyrannosaurids have tall ascending processes. 
  <i>Coelurus</i> has an allosauroid process, while <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>, 
  <i>Chirostenotes</i>, oviraptorids (IGM 100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) 
  and <b>avialans</b> (<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, juvenile Aves) are derived.</p>
<p>66. Gauthier defines this character as metatarsal I lying on the posterior 
  side of metatarsal II as opposed to the medial side, but Middleton's recent 
  work shows that the metatarsal itself is usually placed closer to medial than 
  posterior in living birds and that the majority of hallux rotation is due to 
  a twisted metatarsal I shaft. In addition, articulated non-avialan theropod 
  feet all show non-rotated halluces including and all non-avialan first metatarsals 
  lack torsion. This includes <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> and <i><b>Chirostenotes</b></i>, 
  both coded by Gauthier as having posteriorly placed halluces. The placement 
  of metatarsal I posteriorly in the <i>Compsognathus</i> holotype is thus near 
  certainly due to disarticulation. <i><b>Liliensternus</b></i> has an unpreserved 
  digit I, so is unknown. The first metatarsals of ornithomimosaurs (<i>Garudimimus</i>), 
  oviraptorids (IGM 100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) and deinonychosaurs 
  (<i>Troodon, Deinonychus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>) lack torsion. Gauthier 
  correctly coded carnosaurs as lacking a posteriorly rotated hallux (<i>Allosaurus, 
  Alectrosaurus, Albertosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i>), though he stated in his paper 
  the condition was unknown. <b>Avialans</b> are polymorphic as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  and Hesperornithes lack torsion (the second probably a reversal)</p>
<p>67. This character is another composite, involving both the enlargement of 
  the proximal surface of metatarsal IV compard to II (incorrectly compared to 
  III in the text discussion) and the (presumably) anterior narrowing of metatarsal 
  III proximally. <b>Carnosaurs</b> should be polymorphic, as tyrannosaurids have 
  this character (which Gauthier states despite his coding). <i>Ornitholestes</i>, 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i><b>Hulsanpes</b></i> have unreduced metatarsal III, 
  while oviraptorids are polymorphic (reduced in IGM 100/42, unreduced in <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>). 
</p>
<p>68. <b>Carnosaurs</b> are polymorphic, as tyrannosaurids have reduced prefrontals. 
  <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> and <i>Compsognathus</i> have large prefrontals.</p>
<p>69. <b>Carnosaurs</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids 
  have large axial epipophyses. <i>Microvenator</i> and oviraptorids (IGM 100/42) 
  lack the condition, while basal <b>Avialae</b> does too (<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, 
  <i>Hesperornis</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i>).</p>
<p>70. <b>Carnosaurs</b> are derived, since both <i>Allosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids 
  have small hypapophyses. <i>Coelurus</i>, <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  (e.g. <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>), <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i>, oviraptorids 
  (e.g. IGM 100/42 and <i>Conchoraptor</i>) and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> have 
  hypapophyses, while <i>Compsognathus</i> seems not to. </p>
<p>71. This character (modifications associated with transition point begin close 
  to base of tail) is not only correlated with characters 40 and 20, but also 
  is a composite involving several features in addition to the low number of caudals 
  with transverse processes, large neural spines and short centra. These are transversely 
  rectangular proximal caudal centra, vertically oriented proximal caudal zygapophyses, 
  and proximal chevrons which are longer than deep. The correlation means taxa 
  scored 0 in characters 20 and/or 40 (like Ornithischia and Sauropodomorpha) 
  should be scored unknown here. Of other taxa, <i>Liliensternus</i> lacks rectangular 
  centra at least, while <i>Procompsognathus</i>, <i>Ornitholestes</i> and <i>Coelurus</i> 
  preserve unmodified proximal caudals. <i>Saurornitholestes</i> has the derived 
  condition. </p>
<p>72. Gauthier notes pterosaurs have a strut-like coracoid, so the <b>outgroup</b> 
  should be polymorphic. The coracoid is subcircular in <i>Compsognathus</i> and 
  ornithomimosaurs (as Gauthier states, but oddly codes both as unknown), as well 
  as <i>Microvenator</i>. It is subrectangular in oviraptorids (IGM 100/42 and 
  <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. </p>
<p>73. This character is another composite, with the first part (forelimb &gt;75% 
  of presacral length) correlated with character 60 (forelimb &gt;50% of presacral 
  and hindlimb length) and the second (manus &gt;90% of pes length) correlated 
  with 7 and 43 (manus &gt;45 and &gt;66% respectively of humerus+radius length). 
  Taxa scored as 0 for 60 and 7 and/or 43 (e.g. Sauropodomorpha, Ceratosauria) 
  are scored unknown for this character to reflect the correlation. The <b>outgroup</b> 
  is polymorphic thanks to pterosaurs having both characters. <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> 
  has the first but not the second parts, so <b>Ornithischia</b> is coded as polymorphic. 
  Contra Gauthier, based on its first digit <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' manus 
  was probably only ~73% as long as its pes and its forelimb ~60% of its presacral 
  length. <i>Coelurus</i>, oviraptorids (e.g. IGM 100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) 
  and <i>Elmisaurus</i> are also plesiomorphic. As for <b>deinonychosaurs</b>, 
  <i>Velociraptor</i> (~82% of pes length) and <i>Troodon</i> (~73% of pes length) 
  have shorter manus than <i>Deinonychus</i>, so the clade is here coded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>74. <i>Ornitholestes</i> lacks a bowed ulna, while <i>Coelurus</i> has one.</p>
<p>75. This character (semilunate carpal) is correlated with character 21 (enlarged 
  carpal block), so taxa coded as 0 for 21 should be coded unknown here. This 
  includes the outgroup, Sauropodomorpha and Ornithischia. It also includes Ornithomimosauria, 
  which Gauthier coded unknown already, but he did so improperly because he viewed 
  them as potentially deriving from an ancestor with a semilunate carpal. This 
  kind of decision should not be made prior to coding, as the analysis must discover 
  the reversals which exist. <i>Procompsognathus</i> lacks a semilunate based 
  on its preserved distal carpal II (identified as a radiale by Sereno and Wild). 
  <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown as it lacks preserved carpal elements 
  (as does the referred <i>Tanycolagreus</i> manus). <i>Compsognathus</i> is plesiomorphic, 
  while <i><b>Coelurus</b></i> is unknown as it only preserves distal carpal I. 
  <i>Saurornitholestes</i> has a semilunate.</p>
<p>76. This character is another composite, consisting of lateral bowing of metacarpal 
  III and slenderness of that element compared to metacarpal II. Based on Gauthier's 
  coding, taxa with metacarpal III &lt;70% of metacarpal II's width are coded 
  as derived. <i>Procompsognathus</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i> have the plesiomorphic 
  condition (at least in regard to slenderness for the latter genus). <b>Ceratosaurs</b> 
  should be coded as polymorphic for while all have straight third metacarpals, 
  those of <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and <i>Megapnosaurus</i> are slender. As Gauthier 
  notes, <b>carnosaurs</b> have very slender but unbowed third metacarpals. They 
  are thus here scored as polymorphic, though he scored them as plesiomorphic. 
  <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> does not preserve metacarpal III, Gauthier's coding 
  being from the referred <i>Tanycolagreus</i> manus. <i>Compsognathus</i> is 
  like carnosaurs in having a thin unbowed metacarpal III (it is technically bowed, 
  but dorsally instead of laterally as shown by the ligament pit on the holotype), 
  so is also scored as polymorphic. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> coded by Gauthier 
  all have unbowed metacarpals, but are polymorphic for slenderness (<i>Archaeornithomimus</i> 
  and <i>Gallimimus</i> slender; <i>Deinocheirus</i>, <i>Struthiomimus</i> and 
  <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> robust). <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <i>Elmisaurus</i> must 
  have slender metacarpal IIIs based on their digit III width, but bowing is uncertain 
  (with hindsight is was probably absent as <i>Hagryphus</i> and the Triebold 
  specimen lack it). They are coded as unknown. <b>Oviraptorids</b> (<i>Oviraptor</i>, 
  IGM 100/42, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) all have unbowed metacarpal IIIs and 
  are polymorphic for slenderness (<i>Oviraptor</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  are slender; IGM 100/42 is robust), so are coded as polymorphic. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> 
  and <b>avialans</b> scored by Gauthier have thin third metacarpals, but are 
  polymorphic for bowing (bowed in <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  but straight in <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>), so are coded as 
  polymorphic. </p>
<p>77. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> has a vertical posterior ilial margin, which 
  was drawn incorrectly by Osborn. <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> 
  both have posteriorly tapered ilia.</p>
<p>78. This is another composite character, involving opisthopuby and ventral 
  extent of the pubic peduncle. These are often found together, but not always. 
  <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has both characters, but since <i>Staurikosaurus</i> does 
  not, the outgroup is left as plesiomorphic. <b>Ornithischians</b> obviously 
  have an opisthopubic pelvis and <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> at least has a pubic 
  peduncle extending far ventral to the ischial peduncle, but are oddly coded 
  as plesiomorphic by Gauthier. <b>Carnosaurs</b> (<i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>) 
  have ventrally extending pubic peduncles but propubic pelves, so are coded as 
  polymorphic. <i><b>Microvenator</b></i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i> have ventrally 
  extending pubic peduncles but probably propubic pelves, so are also coded as 
  polymorphic. <b>Oviraptorids</b> include taxa with subequally projecting peduncles 
  and a propubic pelvis (<i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) and those with a ventrally 
  extending pubic peduncle and posteriorly projecting proximal pubis (IGM 100/42), 
  so are also polymorphic. <i>Saurornitholestes</i> has the ventrally extensive 
  pubic peduncle at least, but is coded unknown as the pubic orientation is unknown. 
  <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> are polymorphic as <i>Saurornithoides</i> (the holotype, 
  which Gauthier thought was an undescribed specimen of Barsbold's) has a propubic 
  pelvis. Gauthier recognized this difficulty (though he coded deinonychosaurs 
  as derived), and later finds of <i>Sinovenator</i> and other basal troodontids 
  verify one of his stated possibilities that <i>Saurornithoides</i>' condition 
  is a reversal. </p>
<p>79. This character (pubic boot reduced anteriorly) is correlated with character 
  48, as taxa without significant pubic expansions cannot have a morphology with 
  a large posterior boot and reduced anterior boot. Thus taxa coded 0 for character 
  48 are coded as unknown for this character (including the outgroup, Ornithischia, 
  Sauropodomorpha, Ceratosauria and <i>Liliensternus</i>). <i><b>Microvenator</b></i> 
  has a significant anterior expansion, while <i>Chirostenotes</i>' anterior boot 
  seems larger than any posterior boot it has. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> are polymorphic, 
  as <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Troodon</i> have significant anterior boots, but 
  <i>Adasaurus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> do not. </p>
<p>80. I agree with Gauthier's scoring of ceratosaurs as plesiomorphic, as the 
  condition in derived coelophysids like <i>Megapnosaurus</i> (ischium 64% of 
  pubic length) is seen as a reversal compared to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Dilophosaurus, 
  Liliensternus </i> and probably <i>Segisaurus</i>. Contra Gauthier, the condition 
  in <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> seems to be plesiomorphic (~75%) despite the 
  missing pubic boot. <i>Chirostenotes</i> has the derived condition (50%), but 
  <b>oviraptorids</b> are plesiomorphic (72% in IGM 100/42, 86% in <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>). 
  As Gauthier notes, Hesperornithes and Aves have elongate ischia. Thus <b>Avialae</b> 
  should be coded as polymorphic, though he codes them as being derived due to 
  hypothesized secondary elongation.</p>
<p>81. This character (obturator process placed distally) is correlated with character 
  47 (obturator process present), so taxa coded 0 for 47 (such as the outgroup, 
  Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, Ceratosauria and <i>Liliensternus</i>) are coded 
  unknown for this character. Contra Gauthier, <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (22% 
  down the ischium) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (26%) have proximally placed 
  obturator processes (e.g. compare to 21% in <i>Allosaurus</i> and 27% in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>). 
  <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> have distally placed processes. 
  <b>Avialae</b> is coded as derived, as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has a distally placed 
  obturator process. Gauthier coded the OTU plesiomorphic based on ornithurines' 
  absence of a process and was conservative in interpreting <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</p>
<p>82. <b>Ornithischia</b> is polymorphic for this character (anterior trochanter 
  separated from greater trochanter by small cleft), as <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> 
  has a trochanteric crest. <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  are plesiomorphic. Oviraptorids (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i>, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) 
  are derived. <b>Avialae</b> is polymorphic, as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> has a deep 
  cleft between its trochanters.</p>
<p>83. This character (fourth trochanter absent) is correlated with character 
  63 (fourth trochanter reduced), so taxa coded as 0 for 63 are coded unknown 
  for character 83. This includes Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, Ceratosauria, 
  <i>Procompsognathus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i> and Carnosauria. The <b>outgroup</b> 
  is polymorphic, as pterosaurs and <i>Scleromochlus</i> lack fourth trochanters. 
  <i>Ornitholestes</i>, <i>Compsognathus</i> and oviraptorids (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i> 
  and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) lack fourth trochanters. <b>Deinonychosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Velociraptor</i> and <i>Adasaurus</i> have fourth trochanters.</p>
<p>84. This character (asymmetrical pes) is simply the inverse of character 32 
  (symmetrical pes), so it should be deleted. All thirteen taxa scored for it 
  are changed to unknown.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- Gauthier's analysis is of course the first 
  published cladistic analysis of theropods, so wouldn't be expected to do everything 
  correctly. One issue is the common correlation of characters (14 of the 84 are 
  correlated with others), which inflates the value of certain features (forelimb 
  and manus size, transition point placement, etc.). Another is that many characters 
  actually describe two or more variables that are independent from one another 
  (17 of 84) and should rightfully be split. One flaw common to many early analyses 
  is that the characters are clearly designed to support certain clades Gauthier 
  had in mind, as they are all arranged in order of which clade they help diagnose. 
  This makes the whole thing more a demonstration of his idea than a test of competing 
  ideas. One philosophical issue is that Gauthier often assigns taxa codings based 
  on his subjective opinion of whether a certain state should be present, considering 
  the phylogenetic position he believes them to have. At its worst, this leads 
  to ornithischians being coded as lacking opisthopuby (presumably) because they 
  are not closely related to eumaniraptorans. An explicitly stated example is 
  ornithomimosaurs being coded as uncertain for the presence of a semilunate carpal 
  when they clearly lack one, because Gauthier believed it was possible they evolved 
  from ancestors with it. This is turning the process on its head. Somewhat less 
  egregious are his frequent codings of taxa like Avialae with one state when 
  only one of the two subtaxa exhibits that state (e.g. short ischium in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  but not Ornithurae). While in that particular case and many others, Gauthier 
  is likely correct in his assignment of the plesiomorphic state, this was only 
  (and can only be) verified with future discoveries. For instance, we now know 
  of basal avialans like <i>Shenzhouraptor</i> and <i>Confuciusornis</i> which 
  also have short ischia, showing the condition in Hesperornithes and Aves is 
  derived within Avialae. But in 1986, it was just as possible <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  had secondarily shortened its ischium, when we presume to know nothing of its 
  sister group. The all-zero outgroup is never a good idea, especially considering 
  that for 32 of the 84 characters, the derived state was present in some members. 
  Inevitably, Gauthier was limited by the literature available in 1986. In particular, 
  new material of <i>Herrerasaurus, Chirostenotes, Troodon, Saurornitholestes</i> 
  and <i>Velociraptor</i> have been discovered, and most taxa with the exceptions 
  of <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Hulsanpes</i> have received recent redescription. 
  Oviraptorids, <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Ornitholestes</i> were especially poorly 
  described by 1986. One aspect in which Gauthier exceeds most other analyses 
  is his detailed commentary on each character, with illustrations of many. Another 
  positive consideration is that for most fusion characters, he takes the specimens' 
  age into account. While he may be correct in some instances (cervical ribs), 
  in others it seems he was overly cautious (sternal plates). All considering, 
  486/1512 (32%) of the scorings are incorrect. When corrected, the tree changes 
  to become-</p>

<p>As the first phylogenetic analysis of theropods, Gauthier's work provided the 
  first objective support for several groups. Saurischia is strongly supported 
  by Gauthier's original data, but recoding leaves it with only weak support (no 
  doubt due in part to including herrerasaurids in the outgroup). An alternative 
  called Phytodinosauria or Ornithischiformes was popular in the late 80's which 
  no numerical analysis has supported. Theropod monophyly was standard in 1986, 
  and explicit alternatives were always rare. One notable exception was Huene's 
  work from the 1910's-1930's which placed carnosaurs sister to sauropodomorphs 
  in the clade Pachypodosauria. This hypothesis is rejected extremely strongly 
  by Gauthier's data, and very strongly by the recoded data as well. Gauthier 
  provides strong support for coelophysoids, <i>Procompsognathus</i>, <i>Liliensternus</i> 
  and Ceratosaurus being basal to other theropods, which he named Tetanurae. The 
  standard alternative was to place these taxa in Coelurosauria instead, but that 
  is strongly rejected by both datasets. Within Gauthier's Tetanurae, he found 
  Carnosauria to be the sister group to a Coelurosauria containing several taxa. 
  However, placing <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Coelurus</i> in Coelurosauria was 
  only weakly supported. With recoding the support is even weaker, with <i>Coelurus</i> 
  having an ambiguous position. Placing these taxa within Maniraptora was even 
  more poorly supported, though the evidence for excluding them from this clade 
  remains weak with recoding. On the other hand, both ornithomimosaurs and <i>Ornitholestes</i> 
  were well supported as coelurosaurs originally, but are only poorly supported 
  as such now. <i>Ornitholestes</i> was also moderately supported as a maniraptoran 
  originally, though now it is almost ambiguously placed outside that clade. The 
  monophyly of core maniraptorans (eumaniraptorans and oviraptorosaurs) relative 
  to ornithomimosaurs is moderate in both datasets. Oviraptorosaurian monophyly 
  is weakly rejected in both datasets, as is the idea oviraptorids are closer 
  to birds than deinonychosaurs are. While placing birds or birds and other maniraptorans 
  outside Dinosauria (as Martin, Feduccia, et al. support) was extremely strongly 
  rejected by Gauthier's original data, it remains strongly rejected with the 
  new data.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Experiments with controversial taxa</b>- Holtz (1994) and others criticized 
  Gauthier for assuming the monophyly of Carnosauria and Deinonychosauria, suggesting 
  Allosauridae, Tyrannosauridae, Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae be coded as 
  separate OTUs. Indeed, Gauthier himself noted that due to the propuby of <i>Saurornithoides</i> 
  and bullatosaurian characters noted by Currie, he should have broken up Deinonychosauria. 
  Similarly, most recent analyses have suggested coelophysoids are not ceratosaurs, 
  and <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> is universally recognized to be a ceratosaur instead 
  of an ornithomimosaur. Charig and Milner (1990) criticized Gauthier's analysis, 
  on both deserved and undeserved grounds, but concluded <i>Baryonyx</i> did not 
  fit into his system of classification. This ignores how cladistic analysis works- 
  a taxon is supposed to be entered into the matrix to find the MOST parsimonious 
  placement. It is not expected that there will be no homoplasy so that one can 
  simply look at each node's characters and plug the new taxon in manually. Gauthier 
  noted the &quot;megalosaur problem&quot;, where taxa such as <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  and <i>Megalosaurus</i> were difficult to analyze due to incompleteness and 
  a lack of alpha taxonomy. This has recently been resolved by Benson (2010) and 
  Sadlier et al. (2008). <i>Herrerasaurus</i> is included in the outgroup, which 
  is problematic since it has been more recently recognized as a dinosaur (the 
  ingroup). Finally, Gauthier placed segnosaurs (now therizinosaurs) in Sauropodomorpha, 
  but recent analyses include them in Coelurosauria. Gauthier's matrix will be 
  tested by deleting the outgroup, Ceratosauria, Carnosauria and Deinonychosauria, 
  and adding an outgroup excluding herrerasaurids, Herrerasauridae, Coelophysoidea, 
  <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i>, 
  <i>Baryonyx</i>, Allosauroidea (<i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>), 
  Tyrannosauridae, Segnosauridae, Troodontidae and Dromaeosauridae. Segnosauridae 
  is only coded based on <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Erlikosaurus</i>, as <i>Therizinosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> were not often recognized as being related in 1986.

<p><i>Hulsanpes</i> was excluded as it can fall basically anywhere outside Maniraptora. 
  Within that tree, several taxa have unstable positions. <i>Procompsognathus</i> 
  is at least as derived as <i>Liliensternus</i>, but is outside Maniraptoriformes. 
  <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> can go anywhere in Neotheropoda but outside of Avetheropoda. 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> can go anywhere in Avetheropoda outside Maniraptora. <i>Microvenator</i> 
  can go anywhere in Maniraptora outside the Oviraptoridae+Paraves clade. Troodontidae 
  and <i>Saurornitholestes</i> can go anywhere in the Oviraptoridae+Eumaniraptora 
  clade. Several features match recent placements- herrerasaurids are saurischian 
  theropods, <i>Ceratosaurus</i> is closer to tetanurines than coelophysoids, 
  <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> is outside Avetheropoda let alone Ornithomimosauria, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  and <i>Baryonyx</i> are basal tetanurines, and segnosaurs are maniraptorans.

<p> An interesting experiment is to enforce a traditional Coelurosauria and Carnosauria, 
  since Gauthier's work was one of the first papers to challenge it with an explicit 
  alternative. Herrerasaurids, segnosaurs, dromaeosaurids and avialans were not 
  specified as carnosaurs or coelurosaurs. The resulting tree was 13 steps longer-</p>

  Interestingly, when the positions of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and tyrannosaurids 
  were left to vary as well (since Huene and a few others had considered them 
  coelurosaurs), they both emerged as coelurosaurs. Tyrannosaurids were between 
  <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and <i>Compsognathus</i>, while <i>Ceratosaurus</i> was 
  just closer to birds than the coelophysoid-grade taxa. This tree was 11 steps 
  longer than the original. Similarly, constraining a diphyletic Theropoda as 
  in Huene (1932) where <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i>, Allosauroidea 
  and Tyrannosauridae are closer to sauropodomorphs in a Pachypodosauria results 
  in trees 22 steps longer. <i>Baryonyx</i> emerges as a carnosaur (matching Huene's 
  referral of <i>Spinosaurus</i> to that group), herrerasaurids are basal saurischians, 
  while segnosaurids and birds emerge as coelurosaurs.</p>

  To place herrerasaurids outside Eusaurischia requires 2 more steps, and to place 
  them outside Dinosauria requires 7 more steps. Thus herrerasaurids are moderately 
  supported as saurischians, but only poorly supported as theropods within that 
  clade. </p>
<p> To place <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Procompsognathus</i> in Coelophysoidea 
  requires a single additional step, while making coelophysoids ceratosaurs is 
  two steps longer, with <i>Liliensternus</i> and <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> becoming 
  coelophysoids as well. Gauthier's assumption of ceratosaurian monophyly was 
  based on six characters. Of these, the trochanteric shelf is probably plesiomorphic 
  as it is found in the outgroup, <i>Saturnalia</i> and <i>Herrerasaurus</i>. 
  The proximally fused tarsometatarsus is a coelophysid synapomorphy lacking in 
  <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (the one fused metatarsus of this 
  taxon is pathological). The hood-like supracetabular crest would resolve as 
  plesiomorphic, being present in <i>Saturnalia</i>, herrerasaurids, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  and <i>Megalosaurus</i>. The medial fibular ridge and associated groove would 
  have been resolved as a valid ceratosaurian character though. Same with the 
  tibiofibular sulcus on the distal femur, though <i>Megalosaurus</i> also has 
  this. Finally, Gauthier hypothesizes a narrow pubis may diagnose the group because 
  <i>Allosaurus</i>' is wider, but <i>Megalosaurus, Eustreptospondylus, Tyrannosaurus, 
  Coelurus</i> and others all have slender pubes as well. Thus two of Gauthier's 
  ceratosaur characters are valid, which would exactly balance the two extra steps 
  needed to make coelophysoids ceratosaurs when they are coded separately from 
  <i>Ceratosaurus</i> itself. This ends up making his analysis equivocal in regard 
  to that question, and his assumed monophyly of ceratosaurs not very problematical. 
  <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> was assumed to be an ornithomimosaur (forcing it to be 
  such requires 4 steps), though of the five characters it can be coded for in 
  his diagnosis of the clade, it only has one- gracile humerus with low deltopectoral 
  crest. Of the others, two deserve comment. The metatarsus is said to be narrow 
  and elongate in comparison to tibial length, but the metatarsotibial ratio of 
  <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> (64%) is also similar to some ceratosaurs sensu Gauthier 
  - <i>Segisaurus</i> (62%), <i>Procompsognathus</i> (61%) and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  (64%). Similarly, the pedal digits are said to be short and stout, but that 
  is only based on comparison to the elongate metatarsus. When compared to a neutral 
  value like proximal metatarsus width, the single preserved digit of <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> 
  (II, excluding the ungual) is longer (179%) than ceratosaurs such as <i>Liliensternus</i> 
  (158%) and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> (138%). The other two ornithomimosaur characters 
  it lacks are a ventrally curved ischium and an arctometatarsus. As it required 
  4 steps to make <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> an ornithomimosaur, the shared humeral 
  morphology would bring that down to 3 steps, and <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> is only 
  weakly excluded from Ornithomimosauria. As for <i>Procompsognathus</i> and <i>Liliensternus</i>, 
  the latter lacks both ceratosaur synapomorphies and the former is unknown in 
  this regard. However, subadult <i>Dilophosaurus</i> and/or <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> also lack the features, meaning they may have been present 
  in <i>Liliensternus</i> but merely unexpressed in the subadult syntypes.</p>
<p>Contra Charig and Milner's statements, Gauthier's matrix is capable of handling 
  <i>Baryonyx</i> and resolves it in its correct position as a basal tetanurine. 
  The &quot;megalosaur problem&quot; does not seem to be a major issue, as <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  was resolved in its proper place as a basal tetanurine, while <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  resolved as slightly more derived, though the data could not exclude an avetheropod 
  placement. Enforcing a Megalosauroidea of <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  and <i>Baryonyx</i> is 2 steps longer, with <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> sometimes joining. 
  Forcing <i>Baryonyx</i> and/or <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> to be carnosaurs is 
  2 steps longer (with or without tyrannosaurids), though <i>Coelurus</i> is sometimes 
  a carnosaur as well and <i>Baryonyx</i> can be a carnosaur or have a position 
  sister to Neotheropoda. However, this does not take into account any carnosaurian 
  characters the three taxa may have. Gauthier provides a long list of carnosaurian 
  synapomorphies, of which <i>Baryonyx</i> has seven (supraorbital crests; narrow 
  and short frontals and parietals; posterolateral surangular ridge; strongly 
  opisthocoelous anterior presacral vertebrae; large transverse processes and 
  neural spines; manual digits II and III reduced; robust postcrania) and lacks 
  one (shortened presacral centra). Similarly, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> has six 
  (dorsoventrally elongate orbit; supraorbital crests; narrow and short frontals 
  and parietals; strongly opisthocoelous anterior presacral vertebrae; large transverse 
  processes and neural spines; robust postcrania) and lacks two (shortened presacral 
  centra; dorsally expanded preacetabular process). <i>Megalosaurus</i> has five 
  (dorsoventrally elongate orbit; strongly opisthocoelous anterior presacral vertebrae; 
  large transverse processes and neural spines; dorsally expanded preacetabular 
  process; robust postcrania) and lacks one (posterolateral surangular ridge) 
  and has presacral centra of intermediate shortness. It is worth mentioning tyrannosaurids 
  themselves have only weakly or non-opisthocoelous presacrals and reduce manual 
  digit III (which is similarly reduced in other avetheropods) but not II. Also, 
  <i>Ceratosaurus</i> has eight (dorsoventrally elongate orbit; supraorbital crests; 
  narrow and short frontals and parietals; posterolateral surangular ridge; shortened 
  presacral centra; large transverse processes and neural spines; dorsally expanded 
  preacetabular process; robust postcrania). This indicates Gauthier's idea that 
  these characters are size-related (or alternatively basal for Neotheropoda) 
  is correct, and the only character remaining as valid carnosaurian synapomorphy 
  is the reduced external mandibular fenestra, with the reduced manual digit II 
  and strongly opisthocoelous anterior presacrals perhaps uniting allosauroids 
  with megalosauroids. Since <i>Baryonyx</i> or <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> are 
  carnosaurs with 2 more steps and <i>Megalosaurus</i> is already carnosaur-grade, 
  <i>Baryonyx</i> and <i>Megalosaurus</i> are equally parsimoniously allosauroids 
  or basal tetanurines, while <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> is 1 step more likely 
  to be a basal tetanurine than an allosauroid. While Gauthier has been criticized 
  by later authors for assuming carnosaurian monophyly, allosauroids and tyrannosaurids 
  emerge at the same grade even if coded separately, though <i>Megalosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Coelurus</i> can all be carnosaurs as well. Taking 
  the single valid carnosaurian synapomorphy of Gauthier into account, their monophyly 
  including <i>Compsognathus</i> (as it shares the reduced external mandibular 
  fenestra) would be one step more likely than paraphyly, though <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Coelurus</i> would still have ambiguous placement. Thus Gauthier's assumption 
  of carnosaurian monophyly was non unjustified given his data.</p>
<p> Segnosaurs were viewed by Gauthier as sauropodomorphs, specifically within 
  his clade of &quot;broad-footed&quot; taxa excluding <i>Thecodontosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Efraasia</i> and <i>Anchisaurus</i> (now known to be a more derived sauropodomorph). 
  Segnosaurs known to Gauthier shared 3 characters which he lists as sauropodomorph 
  synapomorphies- lanceolate teeth with coarsely serrated crowns; small skull; 
  tibia shorter than femur. They also share an arched dorsal ilial margin and 
  completely open acetabulum with <i>Anchisaurus</i> and broad-footed taxa. Finally, 
  they are the following with broad-footed sauropodomorphs- large external naris; 
  mandibular condyle set below tooth row; broad pes. However, they lack a transversely 
  compressed dorsal premaxillary process; maxillary teeth increase in height anteriorly; 
  robust forelimbs. These latter three can be ignored though, as it is always 
  possible segnosaurs are the sister taxon of broad-footed sauropodomorphs. The 
  arched dorsal ilial margin and completely open acetabulum can be ignored, as 
  these are also found in caenagnathids, which are the theropod sister taxon of 
  segnosaurids in trees derived from Gauthier's matrix. This leaves 6 characters 
  supporting a relationship to sauropodomorphs, which when subtracted from the 
  10 extra steps it took to place them there leaves us with low support of 4 steps 
  for theropod relationships. Gauthier's matrix provides low support against Oviraptorosauria, 
  but does not include the mandibular characters which left Gauthier with &quot;no 
  doubt&quot; that <i>Caenagnathus</i> is related to oviraptorids. Gauthier was 
  criticized for assuming deinonychosaurian monophyly in the 1990's, but coding 
  dromaeosaurids and troodontids separately results in troodontids being paravians 
  or deinonychosaurs in some trees and closer to oviraptorids in other trees. 
  Adding Gauthier's listed deinonychosaurian synapomorphies (pedal ungual II enlarged, 
  strongly recurved and strongly compressed; pedal phalanx II-2 shortened; prominent 
  posteroventral heel on phalanx II-2) leads to at least weak support for deinonychosaurian 
  monophyly compared to Avialae. It is certainly better supported than some alternatives, 
  as forcing non-monophyly of core maniraptorans by placing troodontids and oviraptorosaurs 
  closer to ornithomimosaurs as in Holtz (1992) is 6 steps longer, while forcing 
  Bullatosauria (Troodontidae+Ornithomimosauria, which Gauthier mentions as an 
  idea of Currie's) is 7 steps longer.</p>
