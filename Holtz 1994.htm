<p>This was the largest theropod analysis to date, introducing several new concepts 
  such as a neoceratosaurian <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, and a large Arctometatarsalia 
  including avimimids, caenagnathids, troodontids and tyrannosaurids. It also 
  provided the first cladistic support for Coelophysoidea, <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Torvosaurus</i> as basal tetanurines, <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> as a carnosaur, 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Ornitholestes</i> as basal coelurosaurs, and the 
  ornithomimosaur-troodontid clade Holtz named Bullatosauria.</p>

<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>outgroup- This consisted of (in increasing order from Theropoda) Sauropodomorpha, 
  Ornithischia, Herrerasauridae, <i>Staurikosaurus</i>, Lagosuchidae (including 
  <i>Marasuchus</i>), Crurotarsi and <i>Euparkeria</i>. The condition of the two 
  nearest codable outgroup taxa will be used to determine the outgroup's state 
  for each character. Holtz claims placing <i>Staurikosaurus</i> inside Herrerasauridae 
  and/or the latter clade in Theropoda does not affect coding.<br>
  Coelophysidae- This included only <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Megapnosaurus</i> and 
  <i>&quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae</i>.<br>
  Abelisauridae- This included <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>, <i>Abelisaurus, Indosaurus, 
  Indosuchus, Majungasaurus</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i>.<br>
  <i>Megalosaurus</i>- Holtz coded this from <i>M. bucklandii</i> and <i>M. hesperis</i>, 
  the latter which is now placed in a separate genus <i>Duriavenator</i>. Only 
  <i>M. bucklandii</i> is used to code it here.<br>
  Dromaeosauridae- This included <i>Deinonychus, Velociraptor, Dromaeosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Adasaurus</i>.<br>
  Oviraptoridae- This included <i>Oviraptor</i>, the yet unnamed <i>Citipati</i> 
  specimen IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i>, <i>Rinchenia</i> (then <i>Oviraptor 
  mongoliensis</i>) and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>.<br>
  Elmisauridae- This included <i>Chirostenotes</i>, <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i> and 
  <i>E. elegans</i>. While Holtz did not include the <i>Caenagnathus</i> mandibles 
  in this family, they are now known to belong to <i>Chirostenotes</i> and/or 
  <i>Elmisaurus</i> so are coded here and the family is referred to as Caenagnathidae.<br>
  Tyrannosauridae- This included <i>Alectrosaurus, Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus</i> 
  (as <i>Albertosaurus libratus</i>), <i>Aublysodon</i> (including much juvenile 
  material of <i>Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Tyrannosaurus</i> and others), <i>Daspletosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Alioramus remotus</i>, <i>Tarbosaurus</i> (as <i>Tyrannosaurus bataar</i>; 
  including <i>Maleevosaurus</i>) and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> (including <i>Nanotyrannus</i>).<br>
  Troodontidae- This included <i>Borogovia, Saurornithoides, Zanabazar</i> (as 
  <i>Saurornithoides junior</i>), <i>Troodon</i> and unnamed specimen IGM 100/44.<br>
  Ornithomimosauria- This included <i>Deinocheirus, Harpymimus, Garudimimus, Anserimimus, 
  Dromiceiomimus, Struthiomimus, Gallimimus, Ornithomimus</i> and <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>.</p>
<p><b>Coding Issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> has a pubic fenestra (Tykoski, 2005), the reconstruction 
  by Welles (1984) being due to him interpreting the cast proximal pubis as real. 
  <b>Abelisauridae</b> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 1990) and <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  (Janensch, 1925) lack pubic foramina however. The proximal pubes of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  and <b>Caenagnathidae</b> (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) are broken (Benson, 
  2009) so cannot be coded. </p>
<p>2. <b>Abelisauridae</b> seems to lack fibular overlap with the astragalar ascending 
  process, based on <i>Majungasaurus</i> (Carrano, 2007). The fibula of <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  overlaps the ascending process (Madsen, 1976). The medial margin of the astragalus 
  is too poorly preserved to determine the condition in <b><i>Acrocanthosaurus</i></b> 
  (Stovall and Langston, 1950; Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> 
  are polymorphic, as Carr (2005) notes <i>Daspletosaurus</i>, <i>Tarbosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> have overlap. The condition in <b><i>Compsognathus</i></b> 
  cannot be determined (Peyer, 2006), and the entire tibia, fibula and tarsus 
  of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> are unpreserved (Carpenter et al., 2005). The 
  condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> cannot be determined due to fusion between 
  the tibia, astragalus and calcaneum. The fibula of <i>Chirostenotes</i> is unknown 
  (Currie and Russell, 1988; Sues, 1997), making <b>Caenagnathidae</b> impossible 
  to code. <b>Troodontidae</b> is polymorphic, as <i>Zanabazar</i> (Norell et 
  al., 2009) appears to have overlap based on the fibular articular surface. <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  is unknown for this character, as even in the specimen with the best preserved 
  tarsals (Mayr et al., 2007), the lateral astragalar ascending process edge is 
  unclear.</p>
<p>3. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> has at least some sacral ribs fused to its centra (Janensch, 
  1925), though the condition is undescribed in <i>Carnotaurus</i> (Bonaparte 
  et al., 1990) and unknown in <i>Majungasaurus</i> due to the age of the sacral 
  specimen (O'Connor, 2007). <b>Abelisauridae</b> is thus recoded as unknown. 
  <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has a structure probably containing the sacral ribs 
  fused to its sacral centrum (Harris, 1998). <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> has fused sutures 
  between its centra and sacral ribs (Brochu, 2003), as does <i>Gorgosaurus</i> 
  (Makovicky, 1995), so <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> is recoded. The relevent parts 
  of <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>' sacrum are hidden behind the ilium (Peyer, 2006). 
  Makovicky (1995) describes the second sacral rib of <b><i>Ornitholestes</i></b> 
  and those of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> as being fused to their vertebrae. <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  also has completely fused sacra (Currie and Russell, 1988; Sues, 1997), so <b>Caenagnathidae</b> 
  is recoded. IGM 100/42 (unpublished photos), <i>Zanabazar</i> (Norell et al., 
  2009) and <i>Velociraptor</i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) have this fusion 
  as well, meaning <b>Oviraptoridae, Troodontidae</b> and <b>Dromaeosauridae</b> 
  should be recoded as apomorphic. The sacral ribs of <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  are unexposed (Mayr et al., 2007; Wellnhofer, 1993; Wellnhofer, 1992; Wellnhofer, 
  1974), the structure called a fourth sacral rib in the Solnhofen specimen probably 
  being a transverse process as it is dorsally exposed.</p>
<p>4. The <b>outgroup</b> must be coded as unknown for cervical pleurocoel number, 
  as they all lack pleurocoels (except derived sauropodomorphs). <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> lacks posterior pleurocoels in cervicals 8-10 (Tykoski, 2005), 
  so <b>Coelophysidae</b> is recoded as polymorphic. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  lacks anterior pleurocoels in its last cervical centrum (Janensch, 1925) , so 
  is recoded as polymorphic. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> and <b>Abelisauridae</b> 
  are recoded as polymorphic, as <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000) 
  and <i>Majungasaurus</i> (O'Connor, 2007) vary in how many pleurocoels they 
  have in each cervical centrum. The one preserved cervical vertebra of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  does not preserve the area which its pleurocoels were located (Benson, 2009), 
  so is recoded as unknown. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Chure, 2000) and <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Harris, 1998) have some cervicals with two pairs of pleurocoels, so are recoded 
  as polymorphic. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> (Brochu, 2003) and <i>Gorgosaurus</i> (Makovicky, 
  1995) often have two pairs of cervical pleurocoels, so <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> 
  is recoded as polymorphic. <i>Harpymimus</i> has some cervicals with two pairs 
  of pleurocoels (Kobayashi et al., 2005), while known ornithomimids have only 
  a single pair, so <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> are recoded as polymorphic. Rauhut 
  (2003) notes only some cervicals of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> have two pairs of 
  pleurocoels, as illustrated by Kurzanov (1987), so it is recoded as polymorphic. 
  <b>Caenagnathidae</b> should be coded as polymorphic, since <i>Chirostenotes</i> 
  has both states (Sues, 1997). Oviraptorids' coding of 0 is retained, as that 
  is true in <i>Rinchenia</i>, <i>Conchoraptor</i> and some <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  (Lu, 2004), though other <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> specimens have two pairs 
  (Makovicky, 1995).</p>
<p>5. Though this character is labeled &quot;cervical transverse processes strongly 
  backturned and triangular in dorsal view (Rowe, 1989)&quot; it actually refers 
  to the shape of the dorsal transverse processes, which is a classic ceratosaurian 
  character illustrated by Rowe in figure 9. As Tykoski (2005) noted, it is a 
  composite character since the broad-based shape and posteriorly angled anterior 
  edge do not always co-vary. <b>Abelisauridae</b> is recoded as polymorphic, 
  as <i>Carnotaurus</i> lacks the character (Bonaparte et al., 1990). <i> <b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  has a triangular diapophysis on the one dorsal illustrated in ventral view (Harris, 
  1998). None of the dorsal transverse processes in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  are preserved well enough to determine their shape (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006). 
  <i>Gallimimus</i> (Osmolska et al., 1972) has several dorsals with triangular 
  transverse processes so <b>Ornithomimosauria</b> is recoded as apomorphic. The 
  dorsal transverse process shape is undescribed in <i>Troodon</i> (Makovicky, 
  1995) and unpreserved in <i>Saurornithoides</i> (Norell et al., 2009), so <b>Troodontidae</b> 
  is recoded as unknown. The dorsals of <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Wellnhofer, 
  1974, 1992, 1993; Mayr et al., 2007) are too poorly preserved to code. </p>
<p>6. Although the basal ornithischian clade Heterodontosauridae has a subnarial 
  gap (Butler, 2008), other ornithischians and sauropodomorphs lack one, so the 
  outgroup is still coded as plesiomorphic. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known 
  to lack a subnarial gap (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  is unknown, as the maxilla and posterior premaxilla are undescribed (Kurzanov, 
  1987). <b>Oviraptoridae</b> is coded as polymorphic, as <i>Rinchenia</i> and 
  <i>Conchoraptor</i> have a gap (Barsbold et al., 1990). </p>
<p>7. Although the basal ornithischian <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> has a proximally 
  fused tarsometatarsus (Santa Luca, 1980), the outgroup's coding of 0 is maintained 
  since <i>Pisanosaurus</i> and sauropodomorphs lack the condition. Coelophysidae's 
  coding of 1 is retained even though some adult <i>Coelophysis</i> individuals 
  retain unfused tarsometatarsi (Colbert, 1989). <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> is 
  recoded as unknown following Tykoski (2005) because the specimens with preserved 
  (and unfused) metatarsi are subadults. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> is recoded 
  as plesiomorphic, as the fused metatarsus in the holotype is pathological due 
  to irregularities and larger metatarsi are unfused (Madsen and Welles, 2000). 
  Abelisauridae is now known to lack fusion (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007). 
</p>
<p>8. The presence of a deep sulcus between the lateral condyle and ectocondylar 
  tuber in <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> is not determinable from the literature 
  (Janensch, 1925). Abelisauridae is coded as polymorphic, since <i>Majungasaurus</i> 
  has a broad shallow groove (Carrano, 2007) but <i>Carnotaurus</i> (Carrano and 
  Sampson, 2007) and <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i> (Tykoski, 2005) have a deeply incised 
  groove. <i>Megalosaurus</i> has a deep sulcus (Benson, 2009), but <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  does not preserve femora so cannot be coded (Britt, 1991). <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> 
  is recoded as polymorphic since the basal <i>Alectrosaurus</i> has a deep sulcus 
  (AMNH online; Carr, 2005). <i>Compsognathus</i> lacks a groove (Peyer, 2006). 
  <i> <b>Chirostenotes</b></i> seems to have a deep sulcus (Currie and Russell, 
  1988), while <i>Avimimus</i> lacks it (Kurzanov, 1987). The condition in <i>Troodon</i> 
  is undescribed, so <b>Troodontidae</b> is recoded as unknown. </p>
<p>9. Axial parapophyses are reduced in the <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991; <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 
  2003; <i>Plateosaurus</i>- Rauhut, 2000), so it is coded as derived. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  (Janensch, 1925) and <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991) do not preserve 
  an axis, so are recoded as unknown. The parapophysis is prominent in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Harris, 1998). The condition in <b><i>Compsognathus</i></b> is uncertain (Ostrom, 
  1978; Peyer, 2006). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> have poorly defined parapophyses 
  (<i>Gallimimus</i>- Osmolska et al., 1972; <i>Ornithomimus</i>- Makovicky, 1995). 
  Kurzanov (1987) labels parapophyses in the axis of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i>, but 
  they must be so reduced as to not be visible in his figure. The condition in 
  <b>oviraptorids</b> known to Holtz is undescribed, so they are recoded as unknown. 
  The condition in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Wellnhofer, 1974, 1992, 1993) 
  is also uncertain. The <b>dromaeosaurids</b> <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1969) 
  and <i>Velociraptor</i> (pers. obs.) have reduced axial parapophyses so are 
  recoded. </p>
<p>10. Axial diapophyses are reduced in the <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991; <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 
  2003), so it is coded as derived. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> (Janensch, 1925) 
  and <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991) do not preserve an axis, so are 
  recoded as unknown. The diapophysis is prominent in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Harris, 1998). The condition in <b><i>Compsognathus</i></b> is uncertain (Ostrom, 
  1978; Peyer, 2006). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> have poorly defined parapophyses 
  (<i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005; <i>Gallimimus</i>- Osmolska 
  et al., 1972; <i>Ornithomimus</i>- Makovicky, 1995). The axial diapophyses of 
  <i> <b>Avimimus</b></i> are reduced to a ridge between the zygapophyses (Kurzanov, 
  1987). </p>
<p>11. Axial pleurocoels are absent in the <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991; <i>Plateosaurus</i>- Huene, 
  1926), so it is coded as derived. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> (Janensch, 1925) 
  and <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991) do not preserve an axis, so are 
  recoded as unknown. The pleurocoel is present in <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Harris, 
  1998). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> should be coded polymorphic, as <i>Garudimimus</i> 
  lacks axial pleurocoels (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). The presence of pleurocoels 
  in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i>' central fossa is uncertain (Kurzanov, 1987; Makovicky, 
  1995). The condition in <b>oviraptorids</b> known to Holtz is undescribed, so 
  they are recoded as unknown. The condition in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Wellnhofer, 
  1974, 1992, 1993) is also uncertain.</p>
<p>12. Basal sauropodomorphs (e.g. <i>Thecodontosaurus</i>- Benton et al., 2000) 
  and ornithischians (e.g. <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991) have anteromedially 
  oriented femoral heads, so the <b>outgroup</b> is scored as apomorphic. <b>Coelophysids</b> 
  (Tykoski, 1998) and <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles, 1984) also have anteromedially 
  oriented heads. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2009) has a femoral head 
  oriented anteromedially. The condition in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is uncertain 
  as the femoral head is not exposed (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006). <b><i>Ornitholestes</i></b> 
  also has an uncertain orientation as its proximal femur is unpreserved (Carpenter 
  et al., 2005). The femoral head orientation of <i>Chirostenotes</i> (Currie 
  and Russell, 1988) is not described or illustrated and is probably difficult 
  to determine due to crushing, so <b>Caenagnathidae</b> is rescored as unknown. 
  <b>Oviraptorids</b> are tentatively recoded as having an anteromedially directed 
  head, based on photos of IGM 100/42. </p>
<p>13. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> has unknown premaxillary proportions (Benson, 
  2009), as the specimen Holtz used has since been referred to <i>Duriavenator</i>. 
  <i> <b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> is now known to have a deep premaxilla (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000) unlike Holtz's coding, though the premaxilla was unknown 
  when his paper was published. <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> (e.g. <i>Gorgosaurus</i>- 
  Lambe, 1917; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  (pers. obs.) and oviraptorids (<i>Oviraptor</i>- Clark et al., 2001; IGM 100/42, 
  <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>Conchoraptor</i>- Barsbold et al., 1990) also have deep 
  premaxillae. </p>
<p>14. This character is listed as &quot;parietal projected dorsally&quot;, but 
  refers specifically to the dorsally projected nuchal crest of neoceratosaurs. 
  Contra Holtz, a crest similar to <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i>Abelisaurus</i> 
  is present in <b>coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- figure 37 of Colbert, 
  1989, contra his illustrations; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 1977; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998). <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> does not preserve 
  the parietal (Welles, 1984) so cannot be coded. <b><i>Megalosaurus</i></b> does 
  not preserve the parietal (Benson, 2009), so cannot be coded. <b><i>Allosaurus</i></b> 
  (Chure, 2000), <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) and 
  <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (e.g. <i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Currie, 2003; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- 
  Osborn, 1912) all have high nuchal crests. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are polymorphic 
  as some <i>Velociraptor</i> specimens (Barsbold and Osmolska, 1999) and <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  (Paul, unpublished) have high nuchal crests. </p>
<p>15. The preserved jugal of <i>Torvosaurus</i> (Britt, 1991) suggests it has 
  an enlarged laterotemporal fenestra. The fenestra of <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) and <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006) also 
  seem subequal to that of <i>Carnotaurus</i> in area. <b>Oviraptorids</b> (e.g. 
  <i>Oviraptor</i>- Clark et al., 2001; IGM 100/42, <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>Conchoraptor</i>- 
  Barsbold et al., 1990) also have large fenestrae.</p>
<p>16. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known to have manual digit III (Currie and 
  Carpenter, 2000). <b><i>Compsognathus</i></b> has at least two phalanges on 
  digit III (Peyer, 2006), contra Ostrom's (1978) interpretation.<b><i>Ornitholestes</i></b> 
  must be coded unknown (Senter, 2006), as no digit III elements are preserved, 
  Holtz's coding being from a manus now referred to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>. <i>Avimimus</i> 
  should have also be coded as unknown, as only the base of metacarpal III was 
  preserved when Holtz wrote his paper (Kurzanov, 1987), but we now know it had 
  phalanges on digit III fro new specimens (Tsuihiji et al., 2009).</p>
<p>17. Manual unguals of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> are unknown (Benson, 2009), 
  so it cannot be coded. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> lacks lips on unguals I and II 
  at least (Senter and Robins, 2005). <b><i>Allosaurus</i></b> has a lip on manual 
  ungual III in some individuals (Chure, 2000), so should be recoded as polymorphic. 
  Among <b>tyrannosaurids</b>, <i>Gorgosaurus</i> has a lip on ungual I (Lambe, 
  1917), so the family is recoded as polymorphic. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are 
  polymorphic, as the basal <i>Deinocheirus</i> has lips on all its manual unguals 
  (Osmolska and Roniewicz, 1969). <b><i>Avimimus</i></b> does not preserve manual 
  unguals (Kurzanov, 1987; Tsuihiji et al., 2009), so should be coded as unknown. 
  <b>Oviraptorids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  lacks a lip on manual ungual I (Barsbold, 1983) while <i>Conchoraptor</i> lacks 
  one on ungual III (Barsbold, 1986). <b>Troodontids</b> should be recoded as 
  plesiomorphic IGM 100/44 lacks lips on all unguals (Barsbold et al., 1987) as 
  does <i>Troodon</i> on its single described manual ungual (Russell, 1969). <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> 
  should be recoded as polymorphic, as <i>Deinonychus</i> has lips on unguals 
  II and III (Ostrom, 1969) and <i>Velociraptor</i> can have them on every ungual 
  (Norell and Makovicky, 1999). <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> is also polymorphic, 
  as it can have lips on all of its unguals (Wellnhofer, 1974). </p>
<p>18. The presence of fusion between the parietals and laterosphenoid in <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  is unknown as Welles (1984) notes no part of the parietals were preserved and 
  that the braincase is too crushed to determine the presence of laterosphenoids, 
  contra his illustration. <b><i>Acrocanthosaurus</i></b> has the bones fused 
  (Stovall and Langston, 1950). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> have unfused sutures (e.g. 
  <i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Carr, 1996; <i>Albertosaurus</i>- Currie, 2003; <i>Alioramus</i>- 
  Kurzanov, 1976; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Osborn, 1912; Brochu, 2003). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  does not preserve a laterosphenoid contact on the parietal (pers. obs.), though 
  there is an elongate opisthotic suture. <b>Troodontidae</b> should be coded 
  as plesiomorphic, as both <i>Zanabazar</i> (Norell et al., 2009) and <i>Troodon</i> 
  (Currie, 1985) lack this fusion. </p>
<p>19. Ossified sterna are seemingly absent from the well preserved skeletons 
  of <b>coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Colbert, 1989; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Chure, 2000), <b>tyrannosaurids</b> 
  (<i>Gorgosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003; contra Lambe, 1917, 
  whose identified sternum is made of fused gastralia), <i> <b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Peyer, 2006; contra Bidar et al., 1972), <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> (<i>Struthiomimus</i>- 
  Nicholls and Russell, 1981; <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>- Sternberg, 1933; <i>Anserimimus</i>- 
  Kobayashi, 2004) and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Wellnhofer and Tischlinger, 
  2004; contra Wellnhofer, 1993, whose identified sternum was a partial coracoid). 
  They are thus all recoded as unknown for sternal fusion. Notably, <i>Carnotaurus</i>' 
  sterna may be fused gastralia like those of tyrannosaurids', but are provisionally 
  left coded as ossified and separate here. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> does not 
  preserve a furcula or have described gastralia (Welles, 1984), so is here considered 
  too incomplete to judge the presence of ossified sterna and is coded unknown. 
  The holotype of <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> does not preserve one scapulocoracoid, 
  the ventral coracoid, furcula or either humerus, so is considered too incomplete 
  to judge the presence of sterna in. <i> <b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is far too poorly 
  preserved to judge the presence or fusion of sternal plates (Benson, 2009). 
  <b><i>Avimimus</i></b> is now known to have fused sterna (Tsuihiji et al., 2009). 
  Sterna are unknown from the fragmentary described skeletons of <b>caenagnathids</b> 
  (Currie and Russell, 1988; Sues, 1997), so they are recoded unknown. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  are recoded as polymorphic, as most specimens have unfused sterna (IGM 100/42 
  and some <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold, 1983). <br>
</p>
<p>20. The <b>outgroup</b> should be coded as unknown, since basal members lack 
  any pubic foot (e.g. <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Sereno, 1991; <i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973) so cannot have either anterior 
  or posterior portions expanded more. Basal theropods such as <b>coelophysids</b> 
  (e.g. <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 2005; <i>Coelophysis</i>- 
  Colbert, 1989) and <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> (Tykoski, 2005) do not have enlarged 
  pubic feet, but still have a distal expansion. This is larger posteriorly in 
  these taxa, so they are coded as plesiomorphic. <i>Ceratosaurus</i> has a smaller 
  anterior expansion (Benson et al., 2009). Contra Holtz, both <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  (Chure, 2000) and <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Stovall and Langston, 1950; 
  Harris, 1998) have posterior boots longer than their anterior boots. The pubic 
  foot of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is mostly unpreserved (Carpenter et al., 
  2005), making its proportions unknown. <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> (Kurzanov, 1981), 
  <i> <b>Chirostenotes</b></i> (Sues, 1997) and <b>oviraptorids</b> (IGM 100/42- 
  unpublished photos; <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold et al., 1990) all have 
  the derived condition. Of the <b>troodontids</b> known to Holtz only <i>Troodon</i> 
  has a preserved pubic boot, but its proportions are undescribed. </p>
<p>21. <b>Coelophysids</b> are recoded as polymorphic, since <i>Coelophysis</i> 
  has a triangular pubis in distal view (Tykoski, 2005). <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Tykoski, 2005), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Rauhut, 2003) and 
  <i> <b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Galton and Jensen, 1979) also have this morphology. 
  <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> must be coded as unknown, since its distal pubis 
  is unpreserved (Janensch, 1925). <i>Ceratosaurus</i> lacks the triangular shape 
  (Benson et al., 2009). Harris (1998) notes the condition in <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  is opposite that of <i>Allosaurus</i>, with the apex of the triangle directed 
  anteriorly. The pubic foot of <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 
  2006) and <b>Caenagnathidae</b> (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) are too incompletely 
  preserved to determine their distal shape. The condition in <b>oviraptorids, 
  troodontids</b> and <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> is still undescribed, so they 
  are recoded as unknown. </p>
<p>22. The preacetabular process is not dorsoventrally expanded in <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  to an extent similar to <i>Allosaurus</i> (Benson, 2009). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  should be coded as polymorphic, since the basal <i>Garudimimus</i> has a tall 
  preacetabular process (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). The ilium of <b>Caenagnathidae</b> 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie and Russell, 1988) is also expanded. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  are polymorphic, as the basal <i>Rinchenia</i> has a tall process (Barsbold 
  et al., 1990). The condition in <b>troodontids</b> is uncertain, as the ilium 
  of <i>Troodon</i> is undescribed and that of <i>Saurornithoides</i> is only 
  a fragment. </p>
<p>23. The condition of the horizontal groove on <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i>' astragalus 
  is variable, as the specimens described by Madsen and Welles (2000) have deep 
  grooves, while the holotype has only a weak groove (Gilmore, 1920). It is recoded 
  as polymorphic. <b>Abelisaurids</b> have a deep groove (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- 
  Carrano, 2007; <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>- Martinez et al., 1986). The astragalus 
  of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is unknown (Benson, 2009). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to have a deep groove (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  only has a weak lateral groove (Peyer, 2006). </p>
<p>24. This character (pronounced supraoccipital crest) is the same as character 
  14 (parietal projected dorsally), as the nuchal crest's height is involved in 
  both. This time it is coded more accurately, except coelophysids should be coded 
  apomorphically, <i>Dilophosaurus</i> should be unknown and dromaeosaurids should 
  be polymorphic. In any case, it is deleted and all sixteen coded taxa are recoded 
  as unknown.</p>
<p>25. The <b>outgroup</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as sauropodomorphs 
  (e.g. <i>Efraasia</i>- Yates, 2003) have the &quot;premaxillary-maxillary&quot; 
  (subnarial) foramen. <i>Torvosaurus</i> is coded as lacking a subnarial foramen 
  by Benson (2009). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known to have the foramen (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000). The condition in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is uncertain 
  due to disarticulation (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  has a subnarial foramen (pers. obs.). <b>Oviraptorids</b> known to Holtz don't 
  have detailed enough photos available to judge the presence of subnarial foramina, 
  so they are coded as unknown. <i>Zanabazar</i> seems to have a subnarial foramen 
  (Norell et al., 2009), indicating <b>troodontids</b> should be recoded as apomorphic. 
  <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> have subnarial foramina (<i>Velociraptor</i>- Barsbold 
  and Osmolska, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Paul, unpublished; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- 
  Currie, 1995), so should be recoded as well. </p>
<p>26. <b>Coelophysids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> 
  has a lateral surangular ridge below the glenoid (Tykoski, 1998). <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  (Benson, 2009) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) are 
  now known to lack and have the ridge respectively. <i>Compsognathus</i> seems 
  to have a ridge (Peyer, 2006). <i>Avimimus</i> lacks this ridge (Kurzanov, 1987), 
  though Caenagnathidae (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie et al., 1994) has it. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  (IGM 100/42, <i>Rinchenia</i>, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold et al., 
  1990) have the ridge. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  (senter, 2007), <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1969)and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> (Currie, 
  1995) have surangular ridges. </p>
<p>27. <b>Abelisaurids</b> (<i>Abelisaurus</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Carrano 
  and Sampson, 2007; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 2007) have lacrimal 
  fenestrae, though they are laterally hidden. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> has 
  a fenestra in its lacrimal (pers. obs.). <b>Dromaeosauridae</b> is polyphyletic, 
  as <i>Velociraptor</i> (Barsbold and Osmolska, 1999) and <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  (Witmer, 1997) have lacrimal fenestrae. </p>
<p>28. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> lacks the suborbital process of the postorbital 
  (Welles, 1984). The state is polymorphic in <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i>, as it 
  is present in the holotype (Gilmore, 1920). <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> lacks the 
  process (Chure, 2000), while <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has it (Stovall and Langston, 
  1950; Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> primitively have the 
  process as adults (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Currie, 2003; <i>Albertosaurus</i>- Currie, 
  2003; <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Carr, 2005), so should be coded as derived, not 
  polymorphic. The ventral postorbital process of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is unpreserved 
  (Kurzanov, 1987). </p>
<p>29. The <b>outgroup</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as basal ornithischians 
  (<i>Pisanosaurus</i>- Irmis et al., 2007; <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Weishampel 
  and Witmer, 1990) have reduced external mandibular fenestrae. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  actually has a moderate sized mandibular fenestra (Chure, 2000), while <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  has a reduced one (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  has an unreduced fenestra (AMNH online). <i>Avimimus</i> (Kurzanov, 1987) and 
  Caenagnathidae (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie et al., 1994) have large mandibular 
  fenestrae. <b>Troodontids</b> (IGM 100/44- Barsbold et al., 1987; <i>Saurornithoides</i>- 
  Norell et al., 2009) have unreduced fenestrae. The condition in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  is unknown due to damage to the area (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996). </p>
<p>30. This character (pubic foot projected only posteriorly) is correlated to 
  character 20 (anterior projection of pubic foot larger than posterior projection), 
  as they are mutually exclusive. The <b>outgroup</b> should be coded as unknown, 
  since basal ornithischians (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Sereno, 1991) and sauropodomorphs (<i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973) lack pubic 
  feet. Coelophysids and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> can both be coded (contra Holtz), 
  as they have pubic feet, albeit small ones. Coelophysids are polymorphic (0- 
  <i>Coelophysis</i>- Padian, 1986; 1- <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- 
  Tykoski, 2005) and <i>Dilophosaurus</i> is plesiomorphic (Tykoski, 2005). <i>Ceratosaurus</i> 
  lacks it (Benson et al., 2009). <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i>' (Benson, 2009) and 
  <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' (Carpenter et al., 2005) conditions are unknown, 
  as their pubic feet are very incomplete. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> known to Holtz 
  (<i>Adasaurus</i>- Barsbold, 1983; <i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell and Makovicky, 
  1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Ostrom, 1976) actually have anterior components to 
  their pubic feet. </p>
<p>31. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> near certainly had a propubic pelvis based on the 
  angle its pubic foot makes with the shaft (Stovall and Langston, 1950; Harris, 
  1998). <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>'s pubis is actually vertical (Wellnhofer, 
  1993), with most other specimens being disarticulated.</p>
<p>32. This character is mistated (pedal digit II longer than IV and closer to 
  III in length), as it should really be pedal digit IV longer than II and closer 
  to III in length. This is a composite character, as some taxa have digit IV 
  longer than II but not closer to III in length. The <b>outgroup</b> should be 
  coded as derived, since basal taxa such as <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> (Santa Luca, 
  1980) and <i>Pantydraco</i> (Yates, 2003) have the state. <b><i>Ceratosaurus</i></b> 
  cannot be coded, as only a few pedal phalanges are preserved (Madsen and Welles, 
  2000). Holtz is correct about abelisaurids (e.g. <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 
  2007), though he cannot have known this in 1994. <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> are polymorphic, 
  as the basal <i>Alectrosaurus</i> has the state (Carr, 2005). <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  also has the state (Ostrom, 1978). Oviraptorids lack the character based on 
  the pes of <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> (Barsbold et al., 1990). <b>Troodontids</b> 
  have it based on <i>Troodon</i> (Sternberg, 1932). <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  is polyphyletic, with some specimens (Berlin and Eichstatt- Wellnhofer, 1974) 
  lacking it, but others (Munich- Wellnhofer 1993; Thermopolis- Mayr et al., 2007) 
  having it.</p>
<p>33. While technically this character (obturator process on ischium distally 
  placed) is only applicable to those taxa with a process, it's also applied here 
  to those taxa with an undifferentiated obturator plate whose proximodistal position 
  can be determined. The ischium of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is distally incomplete 
  (Kurzanov, 1987), but the extent of the ventral surface shows the obturator 
  process must have been distally placed. <b>Troodontids</b> should be coded as 
  having distally placed processes too, based on <i>Saurornithoides</i> (Norell 
  et al., 2009) and <i>Troodon</i> (Hutchinson, 2001). </p>
<p>34. <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Colbert, 1989; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Raath, 1977) have ischia shorter than 66% of pubic length. While the pubic boot 
  of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is missing, the distal end begins to flare, showing 
  even with the added length of the boot the puboischial ratio was probably not 
  less than 70% (Carpenter et al., 2005). The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  is uncertain, as the distal ischium is missing (Kurzanov, 1987). <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  (IGM 100/42- unpublished photos; <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold et al., 
  1990) have longer ischia (71-88%). <b>Troodontidae</b> should be coded as derived, 
  since the ischium of <i>Saurornithoides</i> is only 65% of the preserved pubis 
  length, and the distal pubes are missing (Norell et al., 2009; Norell and Makovicky, 
  1999). </p>
<p>35. <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> does not preserve the femur (Britt, 1991), so 
  cannot be coded. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  (Carpenter et al., 2005) both lack fourth trochanters. <b>Oviraptorids</b> do 
  as well, based on IGM 100/42 (unpublished photos) and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  (Barsbold et al., 1990). <b>Troodontids</b> should be coded as lacking fourth 
  trochanters based on <i>Saurornithoides</i> (pers. obs.), which matches Clark 
  et al.'s (2002) coding for <i>Troodon</i>. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> should be coded 
  as polymorphic, as <i>Velociraptor</i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) and <i>Adasaurus</i> 
  (Kim et al., 2005) have fourth trochanters. </p>
<p>36. This is a composite character, involving proximal caudal centrum shape 
  (round in section vs. rectangular), the number of caudals with neural spines 
  (nine or less) and the inclination of proximal caudal zygapophyses. <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  is plesiomorphic for all three characters (Benson, 2009). <i>Avimimus</i> is 
  coded as plesiomorphic, since its proximal caudal centra are round, though the 
  zygapophyses slope &quot;at a steep angle (Makovicky, 1995). Caenagnathidae 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie et al., 1994; Sues, 1997) has the plesiomorphic 
  state for all three features. <b>Oviraptorids</b> are coded as polymorphic, 
  as <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> have rectangular centra (Lu, 
  2004) , but also over twenty-five caudals with neural spines (Barsbold et al., 
  2000). <i>Conchoraptor</i> has been coded this way by the TWG as well (Clark 
  et al., 2002). IGM 100/42 also has many caudals with neural spines and seems 
  to lack vertical zygapophyseal surfaces (unpublished photos). <b>Troodontids</b> 
  are coded as apomorphic since they have rectanglar centra (<i>Saurornithoides</i> 
  and <i>Zanabazar</i>- Norell et al., 2009; <i>Troodon</i> as coded by Clark 
  et al., 2002) and Makovicky (1995) indicates the first caudal of <i>Troodon</i> 
  has an almost vertical zygapophyseal facet. The number of caudals with neural 
  spines is unknown, though <i>Zanabazar</i> has at least eight (Barsbold, 1974; 
  Norell et al., 2009). <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are rescored as polymorphic, for 
  while both <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> have almost vertical zygapophyseal 
  facets and rectangular centra (Ostrom, 1969; Rauhut, 2003), <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  has fourteen caudals with neural spines (Norell and Makovicky, 1999). Similarly, 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> is rescored as polymorphic since Rauhut (2003) 
  notes the Eichstatt specimen has vertical zygapophyseal facets but the Munich 
  one does not.</p>
<p>37. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000), <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  (Peyer, 2006) and <i>Ornitholestes</i> (pers. obs.) have large prefrontals. 
  <i>Avimimus</i> (Kurzanov, 1981) and <b>Troodontidae</b> (<i>Zanabazar</i> and 
  <i>Troodon</i>- Norell et al., 2009) lack separate prefrontals. While adult 
  <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> lacks separate prefrontals (Brochu, 2003), Tyrannosauridae 
  is still coded as having non-reduced prefrontals due to basal members.</p>
<p>38. <b>Coelophysids</b> should be polymorphic for this character, as <i>Megapnosaurus</i> 
  (Raath, 1977) and especially <i>&quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae</i> (Tykoski, 1998) 
  have frontal-parietal sutures which are anteriorly convex. <b>Abelisaurids</b> 
  cannot be coded as their frontoparietal sutures are fused (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- 
  Bonaparte and Novas, 1985; <i>Indosaurus</i>- Novas et al., 2004; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- 
  Sampson and Witmer, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 1990). <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  does not have this character (Stovall and Langston, 1950; Currie and Carpenter, 
  2000). Although some tyrannosaurines are polymorphic for this (Carr, 2005), 
  Tyrannosauridae's derived coding is maintained. <i>Ornitholestes</i> lacks this 
  character (pers. obs.). <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> cannot be coded, as its frontals 
  and parietals are completely fused (Kurzanov, 1981, 1986). <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  have a large anterior convexity (IGM 100/42 and <i>Conchoraptor</i>- Barsbold 
  et al., 1990; <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Osmolska, 2004). <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  has a transverse suture (Alonso et al., 2004). </p>
<p>39. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i>' amount of hyperextension in pedal digit II 
  is not described by Welles (1984). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> cannot be coded 
  as no pedal phalanges are described, and only one illustrated (Gilmore, 1920; 
  Madsen and Welles, 2000). Neither <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991) or 
  <i> <b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2009) preserve pedal phalanges. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  seems to have a dorsally expanded distal articular surface on phalanx II-1 (Peyer, 
  2006), so digit II may have been hyperextendable. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  also has a dorsally expanded condyle (pers. obs.). <b>Caenagnathids</b> have 
  this (<i>Elmisaurus</i>- Osmolska, 1981; <i>Chirostenotes</i>- coding in Senter, 
  2007), as noted early by Paul (1988). <b>Troodontids</b> are coded as polymorphic, 
  as some (IGM 100/44- Barsbold et al., 1987; <i>Borogovia</i>- Osmolska, 1987) 
  lack dorsally expanded condyles. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> is now known to 
  have a hyperextendable second digit (Mayr et al., 2007). </p>
<p>40. <i>Megalosaurus</i> (Benson, 2009) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000) lack bowed ulnae. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> also lacks 
  a bowed ulna (unpublished photos). <b>Caenagnathids</b> lack described ulnae, 
  so are unknown. Oviraptorids' derived coding is maintained, as the basal <i>Oviraptor</i> 
  has a bowed ulna, as well as IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>, 
  though <i>Rinchenia</i> lacks it (coding in Maryanska et al., 2002). </p>
<p>41. <b>Coelophysids</b> have furculae (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Nesbitt et al., 
  2009; <i>Megapnosaurus</i> and <i>&quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski et 
  al., 2002). <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles, 1984) and <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  (Gilmore, 1920; Madsen and Welles, 2000) lack known clavicles. <i>Carnotaurus</i> 
  preserves an incomplete clavicle that may have been fused to its neighbor or 
  not (Rauhut, 2003), leaving <b>Abelisauridae</b> coded as unknown. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  (Chure and Madsen, 1996), <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (<i>Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Makovicky and Currie, 1998; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- 
  Lipkin et al., 2007) and <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006) are known 
  to have furculae. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> seem to lack ossified clavicles where 
  known (<i>Gallimimus</i>- Kobayashi, 2004; <i>Struthiomimus</i>- Nicholls and 
  Russell, 1981; <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>- Sternberg, 1933), so are recoded as unknown 
  for fusion. </p>
<p>42. Welles (1984) did not describe a distal carpal I or II for <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (though the intermedium may be one), so it is coded as unknown. <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  does not preserve any carpal elements (Galton and Jensen, 1979; Britt, 1991), 
  so cannot be coded. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) and 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> (Peyer, 2006) are now known to lack semilunate carpals. 
  <i> Avimimus</i> has a round trochlear surface preserved on its carpometacarpus 
  (Kurzanov, 1987). </p>
<p>43. The <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic as basal ornithischians (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 1972) lack an ischial foot. 
  <i>Megalosaurus</i> has a large ischial foot (Benson, 2009). Both <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Peyer, 2006) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (Carpenter et al., 2005) have 
  ischial expansions. The distal end of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i>' ischium is not 
  preserved (Kurzanov, 1987). <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>'s condition is difficult 
  to homologize, as it has a terminally placed obturator process which gives the 
  impression of a distal expansion (Wellnhofer, 1974; Mayr et al., 2007). It is 
  here recoded as having one, though when placed in a phylogenetic context this 
  is near certainly analogy only.</p>
<p>44. This is a composite character, consisting of the length and slenderness 
  of metacarpal III (presumably compared to metacarpal II). Unfortunately, neither 
  is quantified. It is credited to Gauthier (1986), who had a similar character 
  using metacarpal III slenderness (&lt;70% of metacarpal II width) and bowing. 
  Basal ornithischians have elongate but thick metacarpal IIIs (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 1972), while basal sauropodomorphs 
  had short but slender metacarpal IIIs (<i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973; <i>Plateosaurus</i>- 
  Huene, 1926). Thus the <b>outgroup</b> is recoded as polymorphic. <b>Coelophysids</b> 
  have elongate metacarpal IIIs (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Colbert, 1989; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Raath, 1969) which are sometimes slender (<i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 1990), 
  so are coded as polymorphic. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i>' and <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i>' 
  metacarpal III is both slender and elongate (Welles, 1984). <i>Carnotaurus</i>' 
  metacarpal III is elongate but robust (metacarpal II and III are switched by 
  Bonaparte et al., 1990, using <i>Aucasaurus</i> as a guide), so <b>Abelisauridae</b> 
  is coded as polymorphic. <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i>, <i><b>Allosaurus, </b>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  and <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (e.g. <i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Lambe, 1917; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- 
  Lipkin and Carpenter, 2008) have short and slender metacarpal IIIs, so are all 
  coded as polymorphic. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>' is both slender and elongate, 
  so is recoded as apomorphic. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' is unknown, as the 
  manus preserving digit III has been referred to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  have elongate metacarpal IIIs (<i>Deinocheirus</i>- Osmolska and Roniewicz, 
  1969; <i>Harpymimus</i>- Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005) that are also sometimes 
  slender (e.g. <i>Harpymimus</i>), so are recoded as polymorphic. Oviraptorids 
  have elongate metacarpal IIIs which are sometimes not slender (IGM 100/42- Barsbold 
  et al., 1990), but as basal <i>Oviraptor</i> and derived <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> 
  have slender metacarpal IIIs the family's coding of 1 is retained. IGM 100/44's 
  metacarpal III is elongate but robust (Barsbold et al., 1987), so <b>Troodontidae</b> 
  is recoded as polymorphic. </p>
<p>45. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i>' posterior postacetabular process edge is broken 
  (Gilmore, 1920), making it impossible to know how posteroventrally sloped it 
  was. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>' is similarly incomplete (Peyer, 2006). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  actually has a vertical posterior edge (pers. obs.) that is difficult to see 
  when the ilium is viewed from a slightly ventral angle as in Carpenter et al. 
  (2005). Troodontids should be coded as derived due to <i>Troodon</i> (Varricchio 
  et al., 2002). </p>
<p>46. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> lacks the anterior coracoid edge (Janensch, 
  1929), making it impossible to know how rectangular it was. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to have a subcircular coracoid (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <i>Avimimus</i>' 
  recently described complete coracoid is described as trapezoidal (Tsuihiji et 
  al., 2009), so is coded as plesiomorphic. The condition in <b>Caenagnathidae</b> 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie and Russeell, 1988) and <b>Oviraptoridae</b> (IGM 
  100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- unpublished photos) is usually described 
  as rectangular, but these taxa have a distinct straight anteroventral edge between 
  the anterior and ventral edges, making them similar to plesiomorphic taxa like 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> instead of those with truly rectangular coracoids like 
  <i>Deinonychus</i>. They are both here coded as plesiomorphic. </p>
<p>47. This is a problematic character (chevrons longer than deep), as no theropod 
  coded by Holtz has all of their chevrons longer than deep. However, the two 
  taxa he coded as derived (dromaeosaurids and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>) do have less 
  chevrons which are deeper than long (less than ten) than other taxa, so this 
  value is used for the character. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> only preserves 
  one partial proximal chevron (Janensch, 1925), so we cannot tell when its chevrons 
  became longer than deep, if ever. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known to have 
  at least sixteen chevrons deeper than long (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). </p>
<p>48. <b>Coelophysids</b> lack sacral pleurocoels (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Colbert, 
  1989; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- coding from Rauhut, 2003; <i>&quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae</i>- 
  Tykoski, 1998). <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> is a more complicated case, for 
  while none of the four sacrals described by Welles (1984) have pleurocoels, 
  Tykoski (2005) identified the fragmentary first sacral centrum which is not 
  complete enough to evaluate for the presence of pleurocoels. As some theropods 
  only have pleurocoels in their first sacral (e.g. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>), it 
  is coded as uncertain here. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> (Janensch, 1925) and <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  (Benson, 2009) lack sacral pleurocoels. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> also lacks 
  sacral pleurocoels (Madsen, 1976; Chure, 2000), the large foramen in sacral 
  four being similar to the neurovascular foramen in <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to have sacral pleurocoels (Harris, 1998). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> 
  should be polymorphic, as <i>Albertosaurus</i> lacks sacral pleurocoels (Makovicky, 
  1995). While Peyer (2006) mentioned small pneumatophores close to the neurocentral 
  margin as possible sacral pleurocoels in <i>Compsognathus</i>, these are more 
  similar to non-central openings in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, so <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  is here coded as plesiomorphic. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> should be polymorphic, 
  as <i>Adasaurus</i> is coded as lacking sacral pleurocoels by Senter (2007). 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> lacks sacral pleurocoels (Wellnhofer, 1974). </p>
<p>49. <b>Coelophysids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> 
  has a steeply sloped quadrate (Tykoski, 1998). As <i>Carnotaurus</i> has a vertical 
  quadrate (Bonaparte et al., 1990) and <i>Abelisaurus</i>' is not definitely 
  so sloped (Carrano and Sampson, 2007), <b>abelisaurids</b> are recoded as polymorphic. 
  <i> <b>Torvosaurus</b></i>' isolated quadrate (Britt, 1991) cannot be used to 
  determine its angle. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known to have a steeply 
  angled quadrate (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i>' quadrate 
  is almost vertical (Peyer, 2006). <b>Oviraptorids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Oviraptor</i> 
  (Clark et al., 2002) and IGM 100/42 (Barsbold et al., 1990) have steeply angled 
  quadrates. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> lack steeply sloped quadrates (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- 
  Currie et al., 1990; <i>Velociraptor</i>- Barsbold and Osmolska, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- 
  Paul, unpublished). </p>
<p>50. This character &quot;mobile quadrate quadratojugal articulation&quot; is 
  problematic. It is only coded as present in <b><i>Allosaurus</i></b> and <b>Dromaeosauridae</b>, 
  and credited to Gilmore (192) and Ostrom (1969). Yet Gilmore indicates <i>Allosaurus</i>' 
  articulation is sutured (and thus immobile) and Ostrom indicates the articulation 
  in <i>Deinonychus</i> was not particularly solid but also unlikely to be mobile. 
  Holliday and Witmer (2008) confirm that in <i>Allosaurus</i> and dromaeosaurids 
  cranial kinesis was impossible due to lacking permissive kinematic linkages, 
  as they have ectopterygoids, epipterygoids, non-mobile pterygoid quadrate articlations, 
  complete diapsid posterior skull articulations and broadly overlapping nasofrontal 
  joints. They are thus both recoded as plesiomorphic. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000), <i>Compsognathus</i> (Peyer, 2006) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996; Tischlinger, 2005) are also now known to have 
  akinetic skulls. </p>
<p>51. <b>Coelophysids</b> have pleurocoels in anterior dorsals (<i>Coelophysis</i>- 
  coding in Tykoski, 2005; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- coding in Rauhut, 2003; <i>&quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998). <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> also has pleurocoels 
  on its first three dorsals (Welles, 1984; Tykoski, 2005). <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  lacks dorsal pleurocoels (Janensch, 1925; Rauhut, 2003). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  has pleurocoels on its first two dorsals (Makovicky, 1995). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are recoded as polymorphic, since ornithomimids (e.g. <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> 
  and <i>Gallimimus</i>- Makovicky, 1995) have dorsal pleurocoels on their first 
  two centra. <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> lacks dorsal pleurocoels (Makovicky, 1995). 
  Makovicky (1995) describes pleurocoels in the first two dorsals of <i>Troodon</i>, 
  so <b>Troodontidae</b> is recoded. </p>
<p>52. This is actually a composite character, since it depends on the combination 
  of a projecting ventral tuber and ectepicondyle with a less developed dorsal 
  tuber and entepicondyle. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> lacks a sigmoid humerus 
  in anterior view (Madsen and Welles, 2000), as does <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> has one (Peyer, 2006), 
  while each humerus of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is different (pers. obs.), 
  meaning it should be coded polymorphic until it is known which has been deformed. 
  While <i>Oviraptor</i> does have the condition, IGM 100/42 (unpublished photo) 
  and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> (Barsbold et al., 1990) do not, making <b>oviraptorids</b> 
  polymorphic. As <i>Deinonychus</i> lacks a sigmoid humerus in anterior view 
  (Ostrom, 1969), <b>Dromaeosauridae</b> should be coded as plesiomorphic. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  (Mayr et al., 2007) lacks the condition too.</p>
<p>53. The <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic, as ornithischians primitively 
  have elongate preacetabular processes (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 
  1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 1972). <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  does not preserve an ilium, so should be coded unknown. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> 
  should be derived, not polymorphic, as neither <i>Deinonychus</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  nor <i>Adasaurus</i> has a short preacetabular process. All <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  specimens have preacetabular processes much longer than their postacetabular 
  processes (except perhaps the Solnhofen specimen, but its posterior ilium is 
  broken off), so should be coded apomorphic.</p>
<p>54. This is a composite character which should be separated into tibial elongation 
  and metatarsus elongation. <i>Coelophysis</i>, <i>Megapnosaurus</i> and <i>&quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> all have tibiae and fibulae which fall out in Holtz's (1994) 
  non-elongate range (Colbert, 1989; Raath, 1969; Tykoski, 1998), so <b>Coelophysidae</b> 
  should be coded as primitive instead of polymorphic. He also codes <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  as polymorphic, but even the subadult holotype has a short metatarsus and an 
  intermediate tibia, so it is recoded as primitive. <b>Abelisauridae</b> should 
  be coded as unknown, as <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>' tibia elongation is intermediate 
  (Martinez et al., 1986), and no ratios are determinable from <i>Carnotaurus</i> 
  or <i>Majungasaurus</i>. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> should be coded as unknown, 
  since the tibia and proximal femur are unpreserved (Carpenter et al., 2005). 
  <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Garudimimus</i> lacks an elongate 
  tibia or metatarsus (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). Both IGM 100/42 (unpublished 
  photos) and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> (Barsbold et al., 1990) have elongate 
  tibiae but short metatarsi, so <b>Oviraptoridae</b> is recoded as polymorphic. 
</p>
<p>55. This is a composite character which should be broken into states for each 
  metatarsal, and include a standard position along the metatarsal (they are all 
  measured at midlength here). The <b>outgroup</b> should be apomorphic, as ornithischians 
  (e.g. <i>Pisanosaurus</i>- Casamiquela, 1967; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 
  1972) and sauropodomorphs (<i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973) basally have metatarsals 
  with midsections deeper than wide. <b>Coelophysids</b> are polymorphic, as while 
  <i>Megapnosaurus</i>' metatarsals are described as transversely compressed (Raath, 
  1969), <i>Coelophysis</i>' are sometimes not (Padian, 1986) and sometimes vary 
  (Holtz, 1994). <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> is polymorphic, as metatarsal IV 
  is slightly broader than deep (Janensch, 1925). <b>Abelisauridae</b> should 
  be coded as polymorphic, since in <i>Majungasaurus</i> metatarsal II is deep 
  but III and IV are not (Carrano, 2007). <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000) and <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Ostrom, 1978) have at 
  least metatarsal II deeper than wide. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are polymorphic, 
  as <i>Harpymimus</i> lacks a deep metatarsal II at least (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 
  2005). <b>Caenagnathids</b> can vary (<i>Chirostenotes</i> has a wide metatarsal 
  II), so should be coded as polymorphic. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> should also be 
  coded as polymorphic, since <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1969) and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> 
  (Colbert and Russell, 1969) at least have deep metatarsal IIs. Based on comparing 
  the Eichstatt and Thermopolis specimens (Wellnhofer, 1974; Mayr et al., 2007), 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> seems to have all three metatarsals deeper han 
  wide. As no information on <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> or <b>oviraptorids</b> 
  known to Holtz (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i>, <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>) 
  could be found in the literature, they are recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>56. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> is now known to have maxillary teeth (Currie and 
  Carpenter, 2000), while <i>Avimimus</i> (Tsuihiji et al., 2009) and Caenagnathidae 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) are known to lack them.</p>
<p>57. <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Spielmann et al., 2007; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Raath, 1969; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- coding in Tykoski, 
  2005), <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> (Welles, 1984), <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  (Janensch, 1929), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000), <b>Abelisauridae</b> 
  (<i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>- Martinez et al. 1986; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 
  2007), <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Chure, 
  2000), <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Stovall and Langston, 1950), <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987), <b>Oviraptoridae</b> (IGM 100/42- unpublished photos; <i>&quot;Ingenia</i>&quot;- 
  Barsbold et al., 1990), <b>Troodontidae</b> (<i>Troodon</i>- Varricchio et al., 
  2002) and <b>Dromaeosauridae</b> (<i>Deinonychus</i>- Ostrom 1969; <i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  Norell and Makovicky, 1999) all preserve an m. iliofibularis tubercle on their 
  fibula. No fibula is known for <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2009) or 
  any <b>caenagnathid</b> used by Holtz.. The condition in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  cannot be determined (Ostrom, 1978), as that area of the fibula is only preserved 
  as an impression.</p>
<p>58. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> seems to have a concavity between the greater 
  trochanter and head (Welles, 1984; Gay, 2002). This is also true for <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  (Janensch, 1929), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 1920) and <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Harris, 1998). <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> does not preserve femora, so cannot 
  be coded. <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> should be polymorphic, as <i>Gorgosaurus</i> 
  (Lambe, 1917) lacks a concavity. The condition in either <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  specimen cannot be determined (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006), and <b><i>Ornitholestes</i></b> 
  does not preserve the proximal femur (Carpenter et al., 2005). <b>Troodontids</b> 
  (<i>Saurornithoides</i>- Norell et al., 2009; <i>Troodon</i>- Rauhut, 2003) 
  have the concavity. </p>
<p>59. Both ornithischians (e.g. <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Thulborn, 1972) and sauropodomorphs (e.g. <i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973) primitively 
  have small flat distal carpals lacking a trochlea, so the <b>outgroup</b> should 
  be coded as derived. No distal carpal I or II are described for <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Welles, 1984). Both <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Gilmore, 1920) and <b>abelisaurids</b> 
  (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 1990) have carpals reduced to the extent 
  that they do not ossify, so are here coded as derived. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to have unreduced distal carpals (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). 
  <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> are polymorphic, as some preserve a distinct trochlea 
  (<i>Albertosaurus</i>- Holtz, 2001; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Carpenter and Smith, 
  2001). <i>Compsognathus</i> seems to have small, flat distal carpals (Peyer, 
  2006). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> does not preserve carpals (Senter, 2006). 
  <i> <b>Avimimus</b></i> (Kurzanov, 1987) preserves a large semilunate carpal 
  fused to its metacarpus. </p>
<p>60. <i>Compsognathus</i> lacks a bulbous parasphenoid rostrum (Ostrom, 1978), 
  as do caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Elzanowski and Wellnhofer, 1996).</p>
<p>61. This character is the pterygoid canal mentioned by Kurzanov (1976)- a foramen 
  for the palatine branch of the facial nerve (VII) which pierces the lateral 
  basisphenoid surface to emerge in the basisphenoid recess. Rauhut (2003) noted 
  the homologous foramen in <i>Troodon</i> was later identified as pneumatic (Currie, 
  1985) and that the facial nerve followed a groove ventrally along the lateral 
  surface. Thus in theropods, the pterygoid canal does not not exist in the sense 
  Kurzanov and Holtz meant, and the character is invalid. All twelve coded taxa 
  are recoded unknown.</p>
<p>62. Abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007) lack plantar contact 
  between metatarsals II and IV. <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, 
  since some (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Lambe, 1917; <i>Tarbosaurus</i>- Maleev, 1974; 
  some <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003) have plantar contact. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  (<i>Harpymimus</i>- coding in Kobayashi, 2004; <i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi 
  and Barsbold, 2005) primitively lack contact, so should be coded as plesiomorphic. 
  <b>Troodontids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, since the basal IGM 100/44 
  (Barsbold et al., 1987) and probably <i>Troodon</i> (Russell, 1969) lack contact. 
</p>
<p>63. The height of the parietals above the supraoccipital is unknown in <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> 
  since they are not preserved (Welles, 1984). <b>Abelisauridae</b> should be 
  coded as polymorphic, since <i>Abelisaurus</i> has deep parietals above its 
  supraoccipital (Bonaparte and Novas, 1985). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> have the character 
  (e.g. <i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Bakker et al., 1988; <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Currie, 
  2003; <i>Tarbosaurus</i>- Hurum and Sabath, 2003; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 
  2003), which is an odd miscoding by Holtz since Bakker et al. (1988) specifically 
  designed it to distinguish 'derived tyrannosauroids'. <i>Ornitholestes</i> has 
  low parietals (personal obs.). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> have the primitive state 
  (e.g. <i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005; <i>Gallimimus</i>- Osmolska 
  et al., 1972; <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>- Tahara, 2009). <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> also 
  has low parietals on its occiput, though its skull roof does rise above the 
  supraoccipital. <b>Oviraptorids</b> lack the character based on <i>Conchoraptor</i> 
  (Barsbold, 1977), as do <b>troodontids</b> based on <i>Zanabazar</i> (Norell 
  et al., 2009) and <i>Troodon</i> (Currie, 1985). <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Alonso 
  et al., 2004) is also now recognized as having low parietals.</p>
<p>64. This character is listed as &quot;large depression in the periotic region&quot;, 
  attributed to Bakker et al. (1988). Bakker et al. used the character for their 
  bullatosaur + bird ?+ oviraptorid clade, referencing Currie's (1985) description 
  of <i>Troodon</i>'s skull. Yet the only periotic depressions noted by Currie 
  were the lateral depression and dorsal tympanic recess, neither of which were 
  noted in ornithomimosaurs. <i>Troodon</i> is now known to lack a true dorsal 
  tympanic recess (Currie and Zhao, 1994), so the character is here interpreted 
  as pertaining to the lateral depression. <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Sanders and Smith, 
  2005), <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Eddy, 2009), <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> (<i>Struthiomimus</i>- 
  Makovicky and Norell, 1998; <i>Gallimimus</i>- Osmolska et al., 1972; <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>- 
  Tahara, 2009), <b>oviraptorids</b> (<i>Oviraptor</i>- Clark et al., 2002; <i>Conchoraptor</i>- 
  Barsbold, 1977) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Whetstone, 1983) lack a lateral depression. 
  The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> has not been described (Kurzanov, 1981, 
  1985). Caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) are now known to have 
  a lateral depression. <b>Troodontids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as 
  the basal IGM 100/44 (Barsbold et al., 1987) lacks a lateral depression. </p>
<p>65. This character is problematic, since not only does it combine frontal length 
  with shape, but frontals show a continuum of triangularity, often depending 
  on independent variables such as the angle of the frontal-nasal suture and the 
  projection of the postorbital process. The <b>outgroup</b> is polymorphic, as 
  basal ornithischians like <i>Lesothosaurus</i> (Sereno, 1991) have elongate, 
  triangular frontals. <b>Coelophysids</b> (e.g. <i>Megapnosaurus</i> - Raath, 
  1977; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998) have long, 
  triangular frontals. <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b>' frontals are too crushed for 
  description, and their dorsal nasal sutures are hidden between the frontonasal 
  crests (Welles, 1984). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> seems to be polymorphic, with 
  some specimens (Madsen and Welles, 2000) having the condition. The skull roof 
  of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is unknown (Benson, 2009). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to lack the condition (Eddy, 2009). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  seems not to preserve its nasofrontal suture (pers. obs.), so cannot be coded. 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i>'s frontals are long and triangular (Mayr et al., 
  2007).</p>
<p>66. Abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007) lack an arctometatarsus. 
  <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> primitively lack an arctometatarsus (<i>Harpymimus</i>- 
  Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005; <i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). 
</p>
<p>67. This character is stated as &quot;gracile metatarsus&quot;, referencing 
  Holtz's (1994) then in press paper on theropod metatarsals. In that paper, he 
  provides a graph of metatarsus gracility (figure 6C- log metatarsal length compared 
  to log midshaft metatarsus width) with lines for standard theropods and for 
  his arctometatarsalians. Taxa are here evaluated based on which line they fall 
  closer to. The <b>outgroup</b> (e.g. <i>Pisanosaurus</i>- Bonaparte, 1976; <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 2003) primitively have gracile metatarsi. 
  <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Holtz, 1994; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Holtz, 1994; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998) also 
  have gracile metatarsi. Abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007) have 
  robust metatarsi. <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as all 
  but the basal <i>Alectrosaurus</i> have robust tarsometatarsi when adult (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> in 
  Holtz, 1994). <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  (Holtz, 1994), <b>oviraptorids</b> (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- 
  Barsbold et al., 1990) and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Mayr et al., 2007) have 
  gracile metatarsi. The basal <b>dromaeosaurids</b> <i>Adasaurus</i> (Senter 
  et al., 2004) and <i>Velociraptor</i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) also have 
  gracile metatarsi, while those of <i>Deinonychus</i> (Holtz, 1994) are more 
  intermediate but still not unambiguously robust.</p>
<p>68. This character (paroccipital process very deep top-to-bottom at root) is 
  taken from Bakker et al. (1988), who used it to diagnose his &quot;tyrannosauroid' 
  group including <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, troodontids, 
  birds and perhaps oviraptorids. Unfortunately, Bakker et al. do not indicate 
  what they measure paroccipital process depth relative to, and due to the gradual 
  medial expansion dorsally and ventrally it is difficult to define its depth 
  at its base. My best quantified approximation of this character, retaining Bakker 
  et al.'s intent is &quot;paroccipital process depth (measured halfway out from 
  the occipital condyle) &gt;40% of mediolateral length (measured from occipital 
  condyle to lateral tip of process). As basal ornithischians (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Weishampel and Witmer, 1990; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991) have deep processes, 
  the <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles, 
  1984), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000), <b>abelisaurids</b> 
  (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- Bonaparte, 1991; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 
  2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  (pers. obs.), caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Alonso et al., 2004) should be coded as derived. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> and 
  <b>coelophysids</b> should be polymorphic, since <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> (Tykoski, 1998) and <i>Deinonychus</i> (Brinkman et al., 1998) 
  are now known to have deep paroccipital processes.</p>
<p>69. The &quot;large excavation around the middle ear&quot; is assumed to be 
  the otic recess, which is enlarged in some taxa to be subequal in size to the 
  occipital condyle. The <b>outgroup</b> is polymorphic, as basal sauropodomorphs 
  (<i>Thecodontosaurus</i>- Benton et al., 2000; <i>Efraasia</i>- Galton and Bakker, 
  1985) have large otic recesses. <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Digimorph) and 
  <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (<i>Albertosaurus</i>, <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Currie, 
  2003; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003) have small recesses, while <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> 
  (<i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell et al., 2004; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- Currie, 1995) 
  and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Alonso et al., 2004) have large recesses. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Gallimimus</i> has a small otic recess (Osmolska et al., 
  1972). <b>Oviraptorids</b> are polymorphic because while <i>Oviraptor</i> has 
  a large recess, IGM 100/42 (unpublished photo), ZPAL MgD-I/95 (Kundrat and Janacek, 
  2007) and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> (Barsbold, 1984) do not. The condition 
  in <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown, as that area is fragmented and covered 
  in matrix (pers. obs.). Similarly, the condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> cannot 
  be observed in the described material (Kurzanov, 1987). </p>
<p>70. Whether the ilia approach each other dorsally is unknown in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  as the area is indistinct in the holotype and crushed transversely in the referred 
  specimen (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006). The condition in described <b>caenagnathids</b> 
  is also unknown, as <i>Chirostenotes</i> only preserves a single ilium (Currie 
  and Russell, 1988). <b>Oviraptorids</b> have the condition however (IGM 100/42- 
  unpublished photo; <i>Rinchenia, Conchoraptor, &quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- codings 
  in Maryanska et al., 2002). </p>
<p>71. The proximolateral ischial scar (for M. flexor tibialis internus 3) is 
  more widespread than early workers believed and is homologous to the proximodorsal 
  process (Hutchinson, 2001). It is thus present in <b>Coelophysidae</b> (<i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998; <i>Coelophysis</i>- Hutchinson, 2001), <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Hutchinson, 2001), <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> (Janensch, 1925), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  (Gilmore, 1920), <b>Abelisauridae</b> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 
  1990), <i>Megalosaurus</i> (Benson, 2010), <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Galton 
  and Jensen, 1979), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Hutchinson, 2001), <i> <b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Harris, 1998), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (pers. obs.), <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987), Caenagnathidae (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie and Russell, 
  1981), <b>Oviraptoridae</b> (IGM 100/42- unpublished photo), and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  (e.g. Mayr et al., 2007). The ischia of <i>Saurornithoides</i> (pers. obs.) 
  seem to lack even a scar, so Troodontidae is coded as plesiomorphic. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Deinonychus</i> has a scar (Hutchinson, 2001). The surface 
  is unpreserved in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006). The 
  <b>outgroup</b> is coded as apomorphic, as it is common in sauropodomorphs (e.g. 
  <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 2003) and present in <i>Lesothosaurus</i> (Thulborn, 
  1972) though Santa Luca (1984) identified a different more ventrodistal ridge 
  as the attachment in <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>. </p>
<p>72. This character (humerus straight) is judged based on the anterior angling 
  of the distal end, as most taxa traditionally scored as having straight humeri 
  still have posteriorly angled proximal ends due to the internal tuber. <b>Coelophysids</b> 
  should be polymorphic, as <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> is coded 
  as having a straight humerus by Benson (2010). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> should 
  also be polymorphic, as <i>Albertosaurus</i> (Parks, 1928) and some <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> 
  (Carpenter and Smith, 2001) have anteriorly angled distal ends. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  has its distal humerus angled anteriorly, so should be coded as plesiomorphic 
  (Janensch, 1925). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) has a 
  curved humerus, while <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Galton and Jensen, 1979), 
  <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2010) and <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 
  2006) have straight humeri.</p>
<p>73. The <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Weishampel and Witmer, 1990; 
  <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Sereno, 1991; <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 2003; <i>Efraasia</i>- 
  Yates, 2003), <b>coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Colbert, 1989; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Raath, 1977; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998) and 
  <b>dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Adasaurus</i>- unpublished photo; <i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  Barsbold and Osmolska, 1999; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- Currie, 1995) should be coded 
  as having circular orbits. The condition in <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is uncertain 
  (Benson, 2010) as the only preserved circumorbital bone is the jugal which does 
  not indicate the orbit's anterior extent. Similarly, the state in <i> <b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  is uncertain as only the posterior orbit is preserved (Kurzanov, 1987). </p>
<p>74. The occiputs of <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> (Coria and Currie, 2002) 
  and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Alonso et al., 2004) are significantly deflected 
  ventrally (&gt;10 degrees) compared to the frontals' axis. Those of <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (pers. obs.) are 
  disarticulated. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> should be polymorphic, since the basal 
  <i>Garudimimus</i> lacks ventral deflection (Barsbold, 1984). <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> 
  should be polymorphic as well, as <i>Velociraptor</i> (Barsbold and Osmolska, 
  1999) seems to have ventral deflection. The <b>outgroup</b> should also be coded 
  as polymorphic, since at least some basal ornithischians (<i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Sereno, 1991) exhibit ventral deflection.</p>
<p>75. The character &quot;enlarged endocranium&quot; is somewhat vague, and using 
  the Encephalization Quotient to represent it (as in Rauhut, 2003) is problematic 
  due to the variability of mass estimates. The endocranial size of <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is uncertain as these taxa do not expose the 
  interior skull. The bulbous frontals of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> (Kurzanov, 1987) 
  strongly suggest is endocranium is enlarged. <b>Oviraptorids</b> (ZPAL MgD-I/95- 
  Kundrat, 2007), <b>dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- Rauhut, 2003) and 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Alonso et al., 2004) are now known to have enlarged 
  endocrania as well.</p>
<p>76. Whether <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> has a raised orbital rim on its frontal 
  is uncertain, as the orbital edge is not preserved (pers. obs.). <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987) and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Alsonso et al., 2004) both 
  have raised rims. A number of taxa with prefrontals and postorbitals contacting 
  or closely positioned to form an orbital notch cannot be scored for this character 
  as they lack much of an orbital margin to their frontals- <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Welles and Pickering, 1995), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen and Welles, 
  2000), <b>Abelisauridae</b> (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- Bonaparte and Novas, 1985; 
  <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte 
  et al., 1990), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 1920), <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Eddy, 2009) and <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> (<i>Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus</i>- 
  Currie, 2003). This is also probably true for <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 
  1991), though no frontal is preserved. All of these taxa are rescored as unknown. 
  The condition in <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is unknown as no frontal is preserved 
  (Benson, 2010). </p>
<p>77. This character (lesser trochanter extended by a lamella of bone separate 
  from the main body of the femur) basically describes a tall, aliform anterior 
  trochanter, so is a composite of characters 92 and 117. It is therefore deleted 
  and <b>all eighteen coded taxa</b> are recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>78. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles and Pickering, 1995), <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  (Janensch, 1925), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 
  1990; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- O'Connor, 2007), <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> 
  (Harris, 1998), <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006), <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987) and <b>troodontids</b> (<i>Troodon</i>- Makovicky, 1995) all 
  have anterior cervical vertebrae with decurved (flexed) prezygapophyses. The 
  condition in <b>tyrannosaurids</b> is polymorphic, since <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> 
  (Brochu, 2003) and juvenile <i>Tarbosaurus</i> (Maleev, 1974) have them. Described 
  <b>caenagnathid</b> specimens lack well preserved anterior cervicals, so should 
  be coded as unknown. </p>
<p>79. <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Gilmore, 1920) and <b>oviraptorids</b> (ZPAL MgD-I/95- 
  Elzanowski, 1999; IGM 100/42- Barsbold et al., 1990; <i>Rinchenia</i>- coding 
  in Maryanska et al., 2002) lack pterygopalatine fenestrae, while abelisaurids 
  (<i>Majungasaurus</i>, <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 2007), <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Eddy, 2009), <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (<i>Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus, 
  Tyrannosaurus</i>- Currie, 2003), caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 
  1997) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Mayr et al., 2007) have them.</p>
<p>80. This character (triangular obturator process) could be considered correlated 
  with obturator process presence (character 94). However, the triangular vs. 
  quadrangular shape difference is caused by the absence of the post-obturator 
  notch, which varies in taxa without obturator processes as well, allowing them 
  to be coded for the character as Holtz did. The post-obturator notch is absent 
  in the <b>outgroup</b> (e.g. <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Knoll et al., 2009; <i>Pantydraco</i>- coding in Yates, 2007; <i>Efraasia</i>- 
  Yates, 2003), <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> (Janensch, 1925), <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  (Galton and Jensen, 1979), but is present in <i>Megalosaurus</i> (Benson, 2010) 
  and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Mayr et al., 2007; Wellnhofer, 1974, 1993). 
  The condition in <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> is uncertain (Kurzanov, 1987), as it 
  does not preserve the distal obturator margin. <b>Caenagnathids</b> should be 
  polymorphic, as some <i>Chirostenotes</i> (RTMP 79.20.1) have the notch. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  is also polymorphic, with some specimens (e.g. AMNH 813 in Hutchinson, 2001) 
  lacking the notch.</p>
<p>81. This is correlated with character 99 (astragalar ascending process &gt;17% 
  tibiotarsal length), as all taxa that have character 99 much have character 
  81. Thus all taxa scored as 0 for character 99 (<b>outgroup, coelophysids, <i>Dilophosaurus, 
  Elaphrosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Megalosaurus, Compsognathus, Archaeopteryx</i></b>) 
  should be scored unknown for this character to prevent weighting. Very few taxa 
  examined by Holtz actually have an ascending process &gt;25% of the tibiotarsal 
  length. While <i>Gorgosaurus</i> does (Lambe, 1916), the fact it is missing 
  in other <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (<i>Alectrosaurus</i>- Carr, 2005; <i>Albertosaurus</i>- 
  Parks, 1928; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003) suggests the family should 
  be coded as plesiomorphic. Also plesiomorphic are <i> </i><i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Rich et al., 2002), <b>troodontids</b> (Borogovia- Osmolska, 1987) and <b>dromaeosaurids</b> 
  (<i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell and Makovicky, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>, 1969). 
  The length in <b>caenagnathids</b> is uncertain as the ascending process of 
  NMC 8538 is missing, while the sacr on RTMP 79.20.1's tibia can only be said 
  to be at least 16% of tibia length (Currie and Russell, 1988). The condition 
  in <b>oviraptorids</b> is also questionable, as Maryanska et al. (2002) code 
  IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> as having a process 
  &lt;25% of tibial length, while Barsbold et al. (1990) illustrates <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>'s 
  as being 30%. They are provisionally coded as polymorphic. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are polymorphic, since the high ratio is found in <i>Garudimimus, Anserimimus</i> 
  and some <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> (Kobayashi, 2004), while other <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> 
  (Kobayashi, 2004), <i>Struthiomimus</i> (Kobayashi, 2004), <i>Gallimimus</i> 
  (Osmolska et al., 1972) and <i>Ornithomimus</i> (deCourten et al., 1985) have 
  low ratios.</p>
<p>82. <i>Torvosaurus</i> (Britt, 1991), <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>- 
  coding in Hwang et al., 2004; <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Russell, 1970; <i>Tarbosaurus</i>- 
  Maleev, 1974; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003) and <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987) lack anterior cervical centra with anterior faces much wider 
  than deep, here quantified as &gt;170%. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> (Janensch, 
  1925) and Oviraptorids (<i>Rinchenia, Conchoraptor, &quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- 
  Lu, 2004; IGM 100/42- coding in Clark et al., 2002) do exhibit the character. 
  The condition in <b>caenagnathids</b> is uncertain, though Sues (1997) notes 
  that of <i>Chirostenotes</i> is at least &quot;distinctly wider than high&quot;. 
  The anterior cervicals of <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> are not exposed anteriorly, 
  so their state cannot be determined. </p>
<p>83. &quot;Narrow nasals&quot; is a vague character, as nasals generally vary 
  in width throughout their length, and there is no indication of what their width 
  is being compared to. The quantified approximation used here is width halfway 
  down their length &lt;75% of frontal interorbital width. Using this measurement, 
  <i> <b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles and Pickering, 1995), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  (Madsen and Welles, 2000), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- Novas and 
  Bonaparte, 1985; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- 
  Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000), 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 2006) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  (pers. obs.) have narrow nasals, while <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Mayr et 
  al., 2007) has broad nasals. <b>Oviraptorids</b> are polymorphic, as IGM 100/42 
  (unpublished photo) and ZPAL Mg-D-I/95 (Osmolska, 1976) have narrow nasals.</p>
<p>84. Promaxillary fenestrae are more widespread than thought by Holtz, being 
  present in <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> (Tykoski, 2005), <b>abelisaurids</b> 
  (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- Bonaparte and Novas, 1985; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson 
  and Witmer, 2007); <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  (Chure, 2000; Witmer, 1997), <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Eddy, 2009), <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Peyer, 2006) and <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (pers. obs.). <b>Troodontids</b> 
  should be coded as lacking a promaxillary fenestra, as it is absent in <i>Saurornithoides</i>, 
  <i>Zanabazar</i> (Norell et al., 2009) and <i>Troodon</i> (Currie, 1985). The 
  outgroup is retained as plesiomorphic, though the basal ornithischian <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> 
  does have one (Butler et al., 2008). <b>Coelophysids</b> are polymorphic, since 
  <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> has a promaxillary fenestra (Tykoski, 
  2005). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> is also polymorphic, as the type only has 
  a fossa (Witmer, 1997), while other specimens have better development (Madsen 
  and Welles, 2000). The area is unpreserved in <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 
  2010), and even if Holtz was using <i>Duriavenator</i> to code he would have 
  done so incorrectly. Caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) lack the 
  fenestra.</p>
<p>85. This is another poorly defined character (anterior cervical zygapophyses 
  elongate), though this one has not been used in subsequent studies. Whether 
  it refers to prezygapophyses of cervicals, or both pre- and postzygapophyses 
  of anterior cervicals is uncertain, nor do we know what structure they are elongate 
  compared to. While Holtz codes tyrannosaurids and maniraptoriforms as apomorphic 
  and credits the character to Gauthier (1988), I could not locate any reference 
  to it in that work. Comparison of the cervical series of <i>Allosaurus</i> with 
  <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> indicates no noticable difference in zygapophyseal length, 
  except <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>' are much shorter on cervicals 7 and 8, and its 
  prezygapophyses on cervical 9 are longer. Similarly, comparing several other 
  taxa used by Holtz (<i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae, Dilophosaurus, 
  Elaphrosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Carnotaurus, Torvosaurus, Ornitholestes, Gallimimus, 
  Deinonychus </i>and<i> Archaeopteryx</i>) shows no cervicals have longer prezygapophyses 
  in tyrannosaurids and maniraptoriforms than in other taxa. While one could arbitrarily 
  define a variation that would divide the taxa into groups (e.g. <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;, 
  Elaphrosaurus, Ornitholestes, Gallimimus</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> have prezygapophyses 
  on cervicals 3 and 4 that are longer than the centrum is posteriorly tall), 
  the uncertainty of equivalence to whatever Holtz had in mind means I prefer 
  to simply delete the character. All <b>15 coded taxa</b> are changed to unknown.</p>
<p>86. The <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Butler et al., 2008; <i>Efraasia, 
  Plateosaurus</i>- Yates, 2003), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Abelisaurus</i>- Bonaparte 
  and Novas, 1985; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Sampson and Witmer, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- 
  Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) 
  and <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> (Peyer, 2006) have jugals that contact the antorbital 
  fenestra. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> and <b>oviraptorids</b> are polymorphic, since 
  <i>Garudimimus</i> (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005) and <i>Oviraptor</i> (Clark 
  et al., 2002) lack contact.</p>
<p>87. <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> is plesiomorphic, with the most distal preserved 
  caudal (~23) still having transverse processes, as do at least thirteen before 
  that, with several gaps. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is plesiomorphic, as it 
  has about 18 or 19 caudals with transverse processes (Peyer, 2006). <b>Tyrannosaurids</b> 
  are polymorphic, as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> has 19 caudals with transverse processes 
  (Brochu, 2003). Similarly, <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> are since <i>Harpymimus</i> 
  has 17 (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). <b>Oviraptorids</b> are plesiomorphic, 
  as IGM 100/42 has 26 caudals with transverse processes (unpublished photo), 
  while <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> have at least that number 
  (Barsbold et al., 2000). <b>Troodontids</b> used by Holtz are best coded as 
  unknown, as <i>Saurornithoides</i> only preserves four proximal caudals, <i>Zanabazar</i> 
  has at least twelve caudals with transverse processes (with multiple gaps between 
  them), and articulated tails of <i>Troodon</i> are undescribed. </p>
<p>88. <b>Oviraptorids</b> (<i>Oviraptor</i>, IGM 100/42- unpublished photo; <i>Rinchenia</i>- 
  Clark et al., 2002; ZPAL MgD-I/95- Elzanowski, 1999) lack a ventral fossa on 
  their ectopterygoids. <b>Coelophysids</b> (e.g. <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 
  1977), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000), abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- 
  Sampson and Witmer, 2007), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Chure, 2000) and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  (Peyer, 2006) have an ectopterygoid fossa. The condition in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  is unknown, as its ectopterygoids are only exposed in dorsal view (Elzanowski 
  and Wellnhofer, 1996; Paul, 2002; Mayr et al., 2007). The <b>outgroup</b> is 
  coded as polymorphic, since <i>Pantydraco</i> has an ectopterygoid pocket (Yates, 
  2003). </p>
<p>89. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2010), <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Peyer, 2006), <i>Ornitholestes</i> (coding in Senter, 2007), <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  (e.g. <i>Harpymimus</i>, <i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi, 2004), caenagnathids 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie et al., 1993) lack a large surangular foramen. 
  <i><b>Acrocanthosaurus</b></i> is polymorphic, as a new specimen (Currie and 
  Carpenter, 2000) has only a small foramen. Troodontids should be coded as apomorphic, 
  as IGM 100/44 (Barsbold et al., 1987) has a large foramen. </p>
<p>90. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> was coded as lacking cervical pleurocoels, but 
  the single preserved partial cervical has camerate pneumaticity indicative of 
  pleurocoels (Benson, 2010). </p>
<p>91. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> has an obturator foramen in its pubis (Tykoski, 
  2005). <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> does not preserve the proximal pubic plate, 
  so cannot be coded for this character (Benson, 2010). The only described pubes 
  of <b>caenagnathids</b> are badly crushed proximally and lack the obturator 
  plate (Sues, 1997). </p>
<p>92. The <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic, as ornithischians (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- 
  Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 1972) have proximally projected 
  anterior trochanters. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> seems to have a low anterior 
  trochanter (Peyer, 2006). The proximal femur of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  is unpreserved (Carpenter et al., 2005). The proximal extent of the anterior 
  trochanter is unknown in described <b>caenagnathids</b>, as RTMP 79.20.1 only 
  preserves its base (Currie and Russell, 1988).</p>
<p>93. This character measures presacral length compared to femoral length, so 
  cannot be coded in <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> or <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i>, 
  which preserve isolated presacral vertebrae from multiple specimens that lack 
  association with limb elements (Benson, 2010; Britt, 1991). Similarly, described 
  <b>caenagnathids</b> (e.g. Currie and Russell, 1988; Sues, 1997) and <b>troodontids</b> 
  known to Holtz (<i>Saurornithoides</i>- Norell et al., 2009; <i>Troodon</i>- 
  Makovicky, 1995) only preserve a few presacrals at most. The outgroup is retained 
  as plesiomorphic, though the basal ornithischian <i>Heterodontosaurus</i> has 
  a short presacral column (Santa Luca, 1980). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 
  1920) and <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Caranno, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- 
  Bonaparte et al., 1990) have presacral columns similar in length to avetheropods, 
  so are recoded.</p>
<p>94. <i>Megalosaurus</i> is now known to only have an obturator flange (Benson, 
  2010), not an actual obturator process. </p>
<p>95. <i>Torvosaurus</i> has a metacarpal I which contacts metacarpal II over 
  half of its length (Galton and Jensen, 1979), while <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) and <b>Caenagnathidae</b> (<i>Elmisaurus</i>- Osmolska, 
  1981) lack the condition. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Deinocheirus</i> 
  lacks the condition (Osmolska and Roniewicz, 1969). <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> should 
  be polymorphic as well, since the contact in <i>Deinonychus</i> is less than 
  half the length of metacarpal I (Ostrom, 1969). <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> does 
  not preserve manual material, so cannot be evaluated (Benson, 2010). The condition 
  in <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is uncertain, as metacarpal II is unpreserved 
  and metacarpal I does not preserve a lateral articular surface (unpublished 
  photo). The condition in described <i> <b>Avimimus</b></i> material is also 
  unknown, as only the base of metacarpal I is preserved (Kurzanov, 1987).</p>
<p>96. This character (loss of digit IV) is taken to mean the loss of phalanges 
  on manual digit IV, as <i>Ornitholestes</i> is coded as apomorphic but still 
  had metacarpal IV according to the specimen used by Holtz (AMNH 587- now referred 
  to <i>Tanycolagreus</i>). Although no coelurosaurs are known to have phalanges 
  on digit IV, avetheropod metacarpal IV is so reduced that caution should be 
  used when coding specimens unless they are complete or articulated. As <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i>' 
  manus is now only known from a partial specimen (Senter, 2006), it should be 
  coded as unknown. <b>Abelisaurids</b> known to Holtz should also be coded as 
  unknown, as <i>Carnotaurus</i>' supposed metacarpal IV is actually a metacarpal 
  I based on <i>Aucasaurus</i>. Ironically, even if the original identification 
  were correct, Holtz miscoded it, as it is a large conical element that lacks 
  phalanges. <b><i>Avimimus</i></b> only preserves a proximal carpometacarpus 
  in its described material (Kurzanov, 1987), so should be coded as unknown. Similarly, 
  <b>caenagnathids</b> known to Holtz don't even preserve metacarpal III, so digit 
  IV would not necessarily be preserved if it were present. <b>Troodontids</b> 
  should also be coded as unknown, since <i>Troodon</i> manual material is fragmentary 
  and IGM 100/44 doesn't preserve any phalanges on digit III except the ungual 
  (Barsbold et al., 1987), so could have easily lost digit IV as well.</p>
<p>97. The <b>outgroup</b> (e.g. <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 2003; <i>Plateosaurus</i>- 
  Huene, 1926; <i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Thulborn, 1972), <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Spielmann et al., 
  2007; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 1969; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- 
  Tykoski, 1998), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000; Gilmore, 
  1920), <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2010) and <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  (Britt, 1991) have cnemial crests with lateral projection distally. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  does not preserve the tibia, so cannot be coded (Carpenter et al., 2005). <b>Troodontids</b> 
  should also be coded as unknown, since the crushed proximal tibial fragment 
  of <i>Borogovia</i> is ambiguous (Osmolska, 1987), while the condition in <i>Troodon</i> 
  has yet to be described. </p>
<p>98. <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> does not preserve the distal pubis, making 
  the size of pubic boot uncertain (Janensch, 1925). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  has a large pubic boot (Benson et al., 2009). The pubic boot of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  is incomplete (Benson, 2010), making its size uncertain. <i>Torvosaurus</i>' 
  pubic boot is small (Galton and Jensen, 1979). The only described <b>caenagnathid</b> 
  pubes (Sues, 1997) are too crushed to determine the pubic boot's size. </p>
<p>99. At ~17% of tibiotarsal length, <i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>' astragalar ascending 
  process is right at the 1/6 boundary used by Holtz to define this character, 
  making <b>abelisaurids</b> best scored as unknown. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  has a low ascending process (Benson, 2010), while <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i>' 
  is over 17% of its tibiotarsal length (Britt, 1991). <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i>' 
  varies between 15% (Chure, 2000) and 19% (Gilmore, 1920), making it polymorphic. 
  At 11%, <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> should be scored as plesiomorphic (Peyer, 
  2006). The same can be said for <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Mayr et al., 2007). 
</p>
<p>100. <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- Spielmann et al., 2007; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- 
  Rauhut, 2003; <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998), 
  <b> <i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> (Welles, 1984), <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Madsen 
  and Welles, 2000) and <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>- Martinez 
  et al., 1986; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007; <i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte 
  et al., 1990) all have a fibular crest on their tibia. The fibular crest is 
  not determinable in either <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> specimen (Ostrom, 1978; 
  Peyer, 2006). </p>
<p>101. This character (distal end of fibula reduced) has been refined by subsequent 
  analyses (e.g. Sereno et al., 1996) to refer to the anteroposterior width compared 
  to midshaft width. Specifically, later analyses all use the dividing point of 
  twice midshaft width to define the states. However, very few taxa used by Holtz 
  actually have a distal fibula over twice midshaft width, and there is no clear 
  boundary between avetheropods and non-avetheropods in this ratio, contra Holtz's 
  coding. The <b>outgroup</b> (<i>Heterodontosaurus</i>- Santa Luca, 1980; <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- 
  Thulborn, 1972; <i>Pantydraco</i>- Yates, 2003; <i>Efraasia</i>- Galton, 1973), 
  <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles, 1984), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Xenotarsosaurus</i>- 
  Bonaparte et al., 1990; <i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007) and <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  (Britt, 1991) all have slender distal fibulae. <b>Coelophysids</b> are polymorphic, 
  as <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i> (Tykoski, 1998) and <i>Coelophysis</i> 
  (Spielmann et al., 2007) have slender distal fibulae. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  is also polymorphic, as the holotype has a slender distal fibula (Gilmore, 1920). 
  The fibula of <b>caenagnathids</b> is unknown in described specimens, so they 
  should be coded as unknown. <b>Oviraptorids</b> are tentatively coded as plesiomorphic, 
  as <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> is illustrated as having a broad distal fibula 
  (Barsbold et al., 1990), though Lu (2004) states at least one specimen has a 
  fibula reduced so as to not contact the tarsus.</p>
<p>102. This character is defined as &quot;coracoid tapers posteriorly&quot;, 
  but historically it has been conflated with the length of the coracoid posteroventral 
  process. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> (Janensch, 1929) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000) have pointed processes. The posteroventral part of <i><b>Avimimus</b></i>' 
  coracoid is not preserved (Kurzanov, 1981). The only coracoid reported for a 
  <b>troodontid</b> used by Holtz is a partial element in an embryonic <i>Troodon</i> 
  which does not preserve the posteroventral portion (Varricchio et al., 2002). 
</p>
<p>103. This character (occiput deeper above supraoccipital wedge) comes from 
  Bakker et al.'s (1988) cladogram, where he used it to diagnose tyrannosaurids, 
  ornithomimids, troodontids, birds and perhaps oviraptorids. Holtz gives it a 
  different distribution, in abelisaurids and avetheropods. Yet the portion of 
  the occiput above the supraoccipital wedge is the transverse nuchal crest, which 
  is only deep in tyrannosaurids of Bakker et al.'s original taxa, and is already 
  covered by character 24 in Holtz's analysis. Thus the <b>fourteen taxa</b> coded 
  by Holtz (including <i>Torvosaurus</i>, which does not preserve occipital elements) 
  are changed to unknown.</p>
<p>104. <b>Abelisaurids</b> might be best coded as having U-shaped premaxillary 
  symphyses, as this is the case in <i>Abelisaurus</i> (Bonaparte and Novas, 1985) 
  and <i>Majungasaurus</i> (Sampson and Witmer, 2007). The premaxilla of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  is unpreserved (Benson, 2010). <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> (Britt, 1991) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) have V-shaped premaxillary symphyses in dorsal 
  view. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> are best coded as polymorphic, as <i>Harpymimus</i> 
  (coding in Senter, 2007), <i>Struthiomimus</i> (coding in Kobayashi, 2004) and 
  <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> (Parks, 1928) have V-shaped symphyses. <b>Troodontids</b> 
  should also be coded as polymorphic, since <i>Saurornithoides</i> has a V-shaped 
  snout (Norell et al., 2009). <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Velociraptor</i>- Barsbold 
  and Osmolska, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Paul, unpublished) have V-shaped snouts, 
  so should be recoded. <i>Archaeopteryx</i> does as well (Mayr et al., 2007). 
</p>
<p>105. This character (deep anterior portion of the surangular) has been defined 
  two ways in subsequent analyses- depth more than 50% of mandibular depth at 
  level of mandibular fenestra (e.g. Rauhut, 2000) or depth more than twice maximum 
  depth of angular (e.g. Sereno et al., 1996). The former is used here as Holtz 
  et al. (2004) used it. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 1920) and <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Eddy, 2009) have deep surangulars. The postdentary bones of <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  are unknown (Britt, 1991). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> (e.g. <i>Harpymimus</i>, 
  <i>Garudimimus</i>- Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005), caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- 
  Currie et al., 1993; <i>Elmisaurus elegans</i>- Currie, 2005) and <b>troodontids</b> 
  (IGM 100/44- Barsbold et al., 1987; <i>Saurornithoides</i>- Norell et al., 2009) 
  have shallow surangulars. <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  has a shallow surangular (unpublished photo).</p>
<p>106. Based on Holtz's later (2000) matrix and many subsequent versions of this 
  character (e.g. Forster et al., 1998), &quot;strong interlocking&quot; of distal 
  caudal vertebrae is defined as prezygapophyses over half the centrum length. 
  These are present in <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 1920) and <b>abelisaurids</b> 
  (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- O'Connor, 2007). They are absent in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Peyer, 2006), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (Carpenter et al., 2005), <b>oviraptorids</b> 
  (IGM 100/42- unpublished photo; <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- 
  codings in Clark et al., 2002; <i>Conchoraptor</i>- coding in Maryanska et al., 
  2002) and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Wellnhofer, 1974). <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  (Britt, 1991) does not preserve distal caudal vertebrae, so its prezygapophyseal 
  elongation is unknown. <b>Troodontids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Zanabazar</i> 
  has short prezygapophyses (Norell et al., 2009). </p>
<p>107. This character (transition point begins closer to proximal half of tail) 
  is partially correlated to characters 36 (9 or less caudals with neural spines, 
  in part) and 87 (15 or less caudals with transverse processes), but also takes 
  into account the number of caudal vertebrae. Unfortunately, very few complete 
  caudal series are known for theropods, making this ratio difficult to determine. 
  Another complication is that the transition point involves multiple variables 
  (transverse process and neural spine reduction; centrum and prezygapophyseal 
  elongation; chevron modification) that do not all change at the same point. 
  For my coding, I used the number with transverse processes as a proxy for the 
  transition point. The <b>outgroup</b> is scored as polymorphic, as at least 
  some basal ornithischians (<i>Scutellosaurus</i>- Colbert, 1964) have transition 
  point in the proximal half of their tail. <b>Coelophysids</b> (<i>Coelophysis</i>- 
  Rinehart et al., 2009; <i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 1969), <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b> 
  (Welles, 1984), probably <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- O'Connor, 
  2007) have transition points in the proximal half of their tails. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  (<i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold et al., 2000; IGM 
  100/42- unpublished photo) have transverse processes on almost all of their 
  caudals. The number of caudals and which percentage had transverse processes 
  for <b>troodontids</b> used by Holtz is unknown.</p>
<p>108. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has a maxillary fenestra (Eddy, 2009), while caenagnathids 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997) lack one, though there is a fossa which may 
  be homologous.</p>
<p>109. &quot;Chevrons attenuated distally&quot; is a vague character, as all 
  theropods exhibit some distal reduction in chevrons. Holtz codes <i>Allosaurus</i>, 
  tyrannosaurids and maniraptoriforms as having this character, as opposed to 
  <i>Compsognathus</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i> and non-tetanurines. The distalmost 
  preserved chevron in <i>Torvosaurus</i> is the seventeenth, which does not differ 
  appreciably from <i>Allosaurus</i> but does differ from <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> 
  in being more slender, and less expanded and posteriorly curved ventrally. This 
  will therefore be used as a proxy for attenuation, though the character would 
  be better divided into several variables. <i> <b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> only 
  preserves one chevron, which is broken, not illustrated and has an uncertain 
  position. While it is stated to be strongly bent, it also is narrower at its 
  ventralmost preserved end than proximally. It seems best to code the genus as 
  unknown. As noted above, <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i>' chevrons are not modified 
  relative to the condition in <i>Torvosaurus</i> (Madsen, 1976). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  (Currie and Carpenter, 2000) and <i>Ornitholestes</i> (Osborn, 1916) both have 
  distally reduced chevrons. </p>
<p>110. <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> does not preserve the posterior maxilla (Britt, 
  1991), so the posterior extent of its tooth row is unknown. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  has an antorbital tooth row (Eddy, 2009). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> should be 
  coded as unknown, as none used by Holtz have upper dentitions. </p>
<p>111. This character (anterior prong of the angular penetrates the dentary-splenial 
  cavity) is taken from Bakker et al. (1988), where it helps diagnose ceratosaurs+tetanurines. 
  However, <i>Plateosaurus</i> (Huene, 1926; Galton, 1984) and <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> (Tykoski, 1998) both have angulars which extend anteriorly 
  between the splenial and dentary. <i>Lesothosaurus</i> lacks it (Sereno, 1991), 
  leaving the <b>outgroup</b> polymorphic. <i>Megapnosaurus</i> was reconstructed 
  by Raath (1977) with an angular which is deep anteriorly to overlap the dentary, 
  unlike other theropods. Rauhut (2003) corrected this, but the relationships 
  with the splenial are still unknown. <b>Coelophysids</b> are thus coded as having 
  the character here. The condition in <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> remains unreported, 
  as the anterior angular is unpreserved (Welles, 1984). <b>Abelisaurids</b> are 
  polymorphic, as the angular in <i>Majungasaurus</i> (Sampson and Witmer, 2007) 
  has a small projection between the splenial and dentary. <i> Acrocanthosaurus 
  </i>(Eddy, 2009), oviraptorids (Barsbold, 1977 as reported by Currie et al., 
  1993, probably based on <i>Conchoraptor</i>) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Elzanowski 
  and Wellnhofer, 1996) have the character. <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> should be 
  coded as polymorphic, since <i>Gallimimus</i> has a splenial which lies in a 
  groove on the angular (Hurum, 2001). <b>Troodontids</b> lack the character based 
  on <i>Saurornithoides</i> (Norell et al., 2009), in which the anterior angular 
  prong does not reach the posterior splenial margin.</p>
<p>112. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has a distally expanded axial neural spine (Harris, 
  1998). The condition in <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> is uncertain, as the axial 
  neural arch is damaged or missing in available specimens (Ostrom, 1978; Peyer, 
  2006). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> should be coded as polymorphic, since <i>Gallimimus</i> 
  lacks an axial spine table (Osmolska et al., 1972). <b>Oviraptorids</b> lack 
  an axial spine table based on IGM 100/42 (unpublished photo). The condition 
  in <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> has yet to be reported.</p>
<p>113. As originally used by Gauthier (1986), the character &quot;strap-like 
  blade of the scapula&quot; refers to a low distal expansion, but Holtz's character 
  also involves scapula blade narrowness making it a composite. Unfortunately, 
  neither low distal expansion (tyrannosaurids are miscoded as derived), blade 
  slenderness (abelisaurids, <i>Megalosaurus</i> and dromaeosaurids are miscoded 
  as derived) or a combination of the two (<i>Dilophosaurus</i> is miscoded as 
  derived) matches Holtz's codings. Assuming a combination of the two, <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Tykoski, 2005) should be coded as plesiomorphic. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  (Madsen and Welles, 2000), <b>abelisaurids</b> (<i>Carnotaurus</i>- Bonaparte 
  et al., 1990), <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> (Benson, 2010), <b>tyrannosaurids</b> 
  (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>- Lambe, 1917; <i>Albertosaurus</i>- Parks, 1928; <i>Tarbosaurus</i>- 
  Maleev, 1974; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003), <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> 
  (Ostrom, 1978), and <b>dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Deinonychus</i>- Ostrom, 1969; 
  <i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell and Makovicky, 1999) should be coded as polymorphic, 
  since they have only part of the character. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Currie 
  and Carpenter, 2000) and troodontids (<i>Troodon</i>- Varricchio et al., 2002) 
  are derived.</p>
<p>114. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (Eddy, 2009) and <b>dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  Barsbold and Osmolska, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Ostrom, 1969; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- 
  Currie, 1995) have interdental plates. Caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>, 
  <i>Elmisaurus</i>- Currie et al., 1993) lack interdental plates. </p>
<p>115. The character &quot;periotic region highly pneumatized&quot; was coded 
  by Holtz as diagnosing maniraptoriforms (with dromaeosaurids polymorphic), but 
  is quite vague as theropods have a number of recesses in that area. Of the three 
  main tympanic recesses, the anterior and posterior both developed in more inclusive 
  groups, so the presence of a dorsal tympanic recess is used as a proxy for this 
  character. In this case, <b>coelophysids</b> (<i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Raath, 1985; 
  <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; kayentakatae</i>- Tykoski, 1998), <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  (Chure, 2000), <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> (coding in Norell et al., 2001), 
  caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- coding in Norell et al., 2001) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  (Witmer, 1990) should be coded as apomorphic, while <i>Avimimus</i> (coding 
  in Norell et al., 2001) and <b>troodontids</b> (<i>Zanabazar</i>- Norell et 
  al., 2009; <i>Troodon</i>- Currie and Zhao, 1994) lack a dorsal tympanic recess. 
  <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are better coded as apomorphic than polymorphic, since 
  <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> (which lacks the recess) is derived compared to <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  (Norell et al., 2004) and <i>Deinonychus</i> (Brinkman et al., 1998). The condition 
  in <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> is uncertain as the type material's prootic is 
  crushed (Welles, 1984) though Pickering and Welles (1995) did not describe a 
  recess on the prootic of their specimen. The <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic, 
  as <i>Pantydraco</i> (Yates, 2003) and <i>Plateosaurus</i> (Galton, 1984) both 
  have depressions comparable to <i>Megapnosaurus</i>.</p>
<p>116. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> lacks a pneumatic paroccipital process (Digimorph), 
  while it is present in <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Sanders and Smith, 2005), 
  caenagnathids (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Sues, 1997), <b>dromaeosaurids</b> (<i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  coding in Currie and Varricchio, 2004; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Brinkman et al., 
  1998; <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>- Currie, 1995) and <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> (Witmer, 
  1990). The condition in <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> has yet to be described, 
  so it is coded as unknown. It is polymorphic in <b>coelophysids</b>, as <i>&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; 
  kayentakatae</i> exhibits the condition (Tykoski, 1998). </p>
<p>117. The <b>outgroup</b> should be polymorphic, as ornithischians basally have 
  aliform anterior trochanters (e.g. <i>Lesothosaurus</i>- Thulborn, 1972; <i>Scutellosaurus</i>- 
  Colbert, 1964). Similarly, <b>coelophysids</b> (<i>Megapnosaurus</i>- Tykoski, 
  2005) and <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Tykoski, 2005) are polymorphic, as adult 
  gracile individuals have aliform anterior trochanters. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  has an aliform trachanter (Madsen and Welles, 2000), while <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  (Kurzanov, 1987), <b>troodontids</b> (<i>Saurornithoides</i>- Norell et al., 
  2009), dromaeosaurids (<i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell and Makovicky, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- 
  Ostrom, 1976) and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Paul, 2002) don't. The proximal femur 
  of <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> is unknown (Carpenter et al., 2005), while the 
  anterior trochanter of described <b>caenagnathids</b> (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- 
  RTMP 79.20.1 in Currie and Russell, 1988) is broken off, making these taxa impossible 
  to code. <b>Oviraptorids</b> might be best coded as polymorphic, as IGM 100/42 
  (unpublished photo) and <i>Conchoraptor</i> (codings by Norell et al., 2001 
  and Maryanska et al., 2002) have cylindrical trochanters, while <i>Rinchenia</i> 
  and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> are both claimed to have aliform ones by Lu (2004). 
  However, the latter two taxa are also coded as having cylindrical trochanters 
  by Maryanska et al. and in <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>'s case, Norell et al.. 
</p>
<p>118. <b>Abelisaurids</b> are best coded as polymorphic, for <i>Carnotaurus</i> 
  only has iliopubic fusion (Bonaparte et al., 1990) while <i>Majungasaurus</i> 
  lacks iliopubic and ilioischial fusion at least (Carrano, 2007). Similarly, 
  <b> <i>Elaphrosaurus</i></b> should be polymorphic as only the puboischial suture 
  is fused (Janensch, 1925), as should <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> since only 
  iliopubic fusion is present in the oldest known individual (Welles and Pickering, 
  1995). Among <b>ornithomimosaurs</b>, only some specimens of the derived <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> 
  (Parks, 1926) have pelvic fusion, so the clade is best coded as plesiomorphic. 
</p>
<p>119. The premaxilla of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> is unpreserved, so it should 
  be coded unknown for the presence of teeth in that element. Holtz was probably 
  using <i>Duriavenator</i>. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has premaxillary teeth (Eddy, 
  2009). No <b>ornithomimosaur</b> used by Holtz has premaxillary teeth, even 
  <i>Harpymimus</i> (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). </p>
<p>120. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> has dentary teeth (Eddy, 2009), while caenagnathids 
  (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie et al., 1993; <i>Elmisaurus</i>- Currie, 2005) 
  lack them.</p>
<p>121. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> has more than five sacrals (Gilmore, 1920) 
  so should be recoded, while <i>Majungasaurus</i> only has five (Carrano, 2007), 
  making <b>abelisaurids</b> polymorphic. The sacrum is unpreserved in <i><b>Torvosaurus</b></i> 
  and the ilia only indicate at least four sacrals were present (Britt, 1991), 
  so it should be coded as unknown. The number of sacrals in <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> 
  is unknown, as the anterior and posterior sacral sections do not join and the 
  ilium has no distinct areas of attachment for sacral ribs (Carpernter et al., 
  2005; pers. obs.). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> used by Holtz all have six sacrals, 
  even <i>Harpymimus</i> and <i>Garudimimus</i> (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). 
  <b>Dromaeosaurids</b> are polymorphic, as <i>Deinonychus</i> (Ostrom, 1976) 
  and <i>Velociraptor</i> (Norell and Makovicky, 1999) have six sacrals. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  is also polymorphic, since the Thermopolis specimen (Mayr et al., 2007) has 
  six sacrals.</p>
<p>122. Abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- Carrano, 2007) have metatarsal IV 
  closer to II in length than III. The length of metatarsal IV in <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> 
  is unknown (Janensch, 1925). No associated metatarsus of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  is known (Benson, 2010), making it impossible to code. Metatarsal IV is closer 
  to metatarsal III in length than to metatarsal II in some <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  specimens (Chure, 2000), making it polymorphic. The basal <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  <i>Harpymimus</i> and <i>Garudimimus</i> (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005) have 
  the condition, meaning the OTU should be coded as derived. <b>Oviraptorids</b> 
  (IGM 100/42, <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- Barsbold et 
  al., 1990) lack the condition. </p>
<p>123. <b>Coelophysids</b> should be coded as polymorphic, as <i>Megapnosaurus</i> 
  has a small fossa at the base of its astragalar ascending process (Raath, 1990). 
  The <b>outgroup</b> could also be coded as polymorphic, since at least some 
  basal ornithischians (<i>Scutellosaurus</i>- Colbert, 1964) have the same kind 
  of structure. The ascending process of <i><b>Elaphrosaurus</b></i> is missing 
  (Janensch, 1925), so it should be coded unknown. Both abelisaurids (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- 
  Carrano, 2007) and some <i>Ceratosaurus</i> specimens (Madsen and Welles, 2000) 
  have a sharp excavation on the lateral half of their ascending processes. However, 
  it's uncertain whether this is homologous to the fossa in various coelurosaurs, 
  which are centrally located and do not extend to the proximal edge of the process. 
  They are here retained as plesiomorphic. <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i>' astragalus 
  is unknown (Benson, 2010). As all <b>tyrannosaurids</b> (including the basal 
  <i>Alectrosaurus</i>- Carr, 2005) and <b>ornithomimosaurs</b> (including the 
  basal <i>Harpymimus</i>- coding in Kobayashi, 2004; and <i>Garudimimus</i>- 
  Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005) have the fossa, the clades are scored as derived 
  instead of polymorphic. <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> has the fossa (Peyer, 2006), 
  so is recoded as derived. <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> does not preserve the 
  astragalus, while <b>caenagnathids</b> (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie and Russell, 
  1988) don't preserve the proximal ascending process, so both are recoded as 
  unknown. </p>
<p>124. Most taxa coded as having metacarpal I a third of the length of metacarpal 
  II or shorter actually have longer metacarpal I's- <b>Tyrannosauridae</b> (<i>Gorgosaurus</i>- 
  Lambe, 1917; <i>Albertosaurus</i>- Parks, 1928; <i>Daspletosaurus</i>- Russell, 
  1970; <i>Tarbosaurus</i>- Maleev, 1974; <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>- Brochu, 2003), 
  <b>Caenagnathidae</b> (<i>Chirostenotes</i>- Currie, 1990; <i>Elmisaurus</i>- 
  Osmolska, 1981), <b>Oviraptoridae</b> (IGM 100/42 and <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i>- 
  Barsbold et al., 1990; <i>Conchoraptor</i>- Barsbold, 1986), <b>Troodontidae</b> 
  (IGM 100/44- Barsbold et al., 1987) and <b>Dromaeosauridae</b> (<i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  Norell and Makovicky, 1999; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Ostrom, 1969). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  is now known to have a long metacarpal I as well (Currie and Carpenter, 2000). 
  <i><b>Compsognathus</b></i> has metacarpal I less than a third the length of 
  metacarpal II (Peyer, 2006; Gishlick and Gauthier, 2007). <b>Ornithomimosaurs</b> 
  are not polymorphic, as even <i>Harpymimus</i> has metacarpal I 51% of metacarpal 
  II's length (Kobayashi and Barsbold, 2005). <i><b>Ornitholestes</b></i> does 
  not preserve metacarpal II (Senter, 2006), so cannot be coded. </p>
<p>125. This character (manual digit I reduced in length) is correlated with the 
  previous character, as metacarpal I is part of manual digit I. <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  is the only taxon coded differently than character 124 (besides <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  using Ostrom's erroneous reconstruction; both are coded as having long metacarpal 
  I but short digit I), but ironically has a longer phalanx I-1 than any other 
  included taxon. In fact, avetheropods generally have a longer phalanx I-1 than 
  non-avetheropods, contra Holtz's coding. Thus if we try to remove the correlation 
  by using only phalanx I-1, the character still lacks a similar distribution. 
  Even if we ignore the correlation and just look at digit I's length compared 
  to digit II (which also faces problems of homology, since different elements 
  in those digits may change length to achieve a superficially similar result), 
  avetheropods do not have shorter digit I than non-avetheropods. Instead, maniraptorans 
  and coelophysoids have the shortest digit I, with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  shorter than the others. But the homology concerns are justified, as this is 
  due to phalanx I-1 being short in coelophysoids, but metacarpal I being short 
  in the eumaniraptorans. Notably, <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> and <i><b>Avimimus</b></i> 
  cannot be coded in any situation, as they don't preserve manual phalanx I-1. 
  Faced with the option of coding the character in a non-homologous and correlated 
  way, or in a way that doesn't correspond to Holtz's codings and is modified 
  from his intent, it seems best to simply delete it. The <b>twelve taxa</b> that 
  preserve complete digit I's are thus recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>126. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> (coding in Eddy, 2009) and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  (Ostrom, 1978) have elliptical premaxillary teeth. <b>Abelisaurids</b> (<i>Majungasaurus</i>- 
  Smith, 2007) and <i>Ornitholestes</i> (coding in Norell et al., 2001) have D-shaped 
  premaxillary teeth. <b>Troodontids</b> are best coded as polymorphic, since 
  in at least <i>Zanabazar</i>, only the anterior two pairs of premaxillary teeth 
  have flat lingual sides. The premaxillary teeth of <i><b>Megalosaurus</b></i> 
  are unknown (Benson, 2010), and Holtz was probably basing his coding on Duriavenator. 
</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- Holtz's analysis was impressive at the 
  time for its size, in both characters and taxa used. The analysis has a refreshingly 
  low Consistancy Index of 0.51, indicating it was not designed with a particular 
  result in mind. Only 7% (9/126) of the characters are composites and only 3% 
  (4/126) are correlated with others, which is quite an improvement over Gauthier's 
  analysis. Another improvement is the use of lower level taxa for OTUs, with 
  only <i>Megalosaurus</i> being a potential composite due to the inclusion of 
  <i>Duriavenator</i>'s states. The use of polymorphies is an improvement over 
  most prior analyses, but the all-zero outgroup is again an issue as it should 
  be coded as apomorphic or polymorphic for at least 24% (30/126) of the characters. 
  While Holtz did not test any alternate topologies, he did illustrate a consensus 
  cladogram showing which avetheropod nodes collapsed with one more step, and 
  noted in three more steps basal tetanurine phylogeny collapsed. The two main 
  issues with the study were both mentioned by Clark et al. (1994). First, many 
  characters are vague (e.g. depression in periotic region; narrow nasals; periotic 
  region highly pneumatized; chevrons attenuated distally) and a much larger number 
  are more precisely stated but still unquantified. As none were described in 
  more detail, and the cited sources like Bakker et al. (1988) were just as vague, 
  it's difficult to code these unambiguously. Yet the greatest problem are the 
  miscodings. Some are simply due to specimens which were unknown at the time, 
  like most <i>Majungasaurus</i> material, Currie and Carpenter's (2000) <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  skeleton, Sues' (1997) <i>Chirostenotes</i> skeleton and the MOR <i>Troodon</i> 
  material. Many are due to depending on the pre-1994 literature, especially for 
  coelophysids, <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i>, basal ornithomimosaurs, 
  and non-<i>Oviraptor</i> oviraptorids. Yet it seems as if in most cases, taxa 
  were coded based on what they should have instead of what they were known to 
  have. This is most obvious in the many codings based on elements which are not 
  even preserved in the taxa in question. For instance, <i>Ornitholestes</i> is 
  coded for at least nine characters involving the pubic boot, proximal femur, 
  tibia and tarsus though these are not preserved in the only specimen, which 
  Holtz examined personally. Similarly, <i>Torvosaurus</i> is coded for at least 
  ten characters involving the occiput, axis, distal caudals, carpals and femur 
  though none of these are preserved (though the axis and femur are preserved 
  in the &quot;Brontoraptor&quot; specimens some authors assign to <i>Torvosaurus</i>, 
  these were discovered after Holtz's paper was submitted). Another manifestation 
  of this flaw is when the character states are obvious, but don't match the clade 
  the character was meant to diagnose. Examples are the circular orbits and anteromedially 
  projected femoral heads of coelophysoids and the outgroup, or the large laterotemporal 
  fenestrae of oviraptorids. In all, over a third of the entres (36%- 905/2520) 
  were miscoded, which resulted in quite a different topology once corrected-</p>

This tree is interesting because while it matches the modern consensus in having 
<i>Dilophosaurus</i> outside Coelophysoidea, <i>Ceratosaurus</i> closer to tetanurines 
than coelophysoids, tyrannosaurids outside the <i>Compsognathus</i>+<i>Ornitholestes</i>+Maniraptoriformes 
clade, and the same contents for Maniraptora and Paraves, other aspects are odd. 
Tetanurine abelisaurids have otherwise only been recovered by Forster (1999) (where 
they were also closer to birds than <i>Torvosaurus</i>), while coelurosaurian 
<i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> was suggested by Bakker et al. (1988), and <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> 
has never been recovered as a coelurosaur although that was its precladistic position. 
Otherwise, only the paraphyletic oviraptorosaurs and deinonychosaurs are unusual.

<p>Holtz's analysis was the largest of its kind at the time of publication, so 
  provides the first decent test of clade strength and allows us to test many 
  alternative hypotheses. The original matrix moderately supported <i>Dilophosaurus</i> 
  in Coelophysoidea, but the recoded one very weakly rejects it. Placing coelophysoids 
  in Ceratosauria is only weakly supported in the original matrix, but has moderate 
  rejection in the new one. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> was moderately supported as a 
  ceratosaur, and moderately supported as an abelisauroid within that clade in 
  Holtz's matrix. It was moderately rejected as a coelophysoid or basal neoceratosaur 
  and strongly rejected as a ornithomimosaur. Interestingly, the recoded matrix 
  places it in Coelurosauria where it is sometimes an ornithomimosaur. It moderately 
  rejects the idea it is a coelophysoid, basal ceratosaur or abelisauroid. Raath's 
  idea coelophysids were the closest theropods to birds is very strongly rejected 
  by both datasets, especially so in the original. The old matrix moderately supports 
  placing abelisaurids in Ceratosauria while the new one very weakly supports 
  tetanurine abelisaurids, and very weakly rejects placing abelisaurids outside 
  the Ceratosaurus+Tetanurae clade. Paul's idea abelisaurids are megalosauroids 
  was strongly rejected in the original study, but only very weakly rejected in 
  the new one. Britt's idea <i>Torvosaurus</i> is a ceratosaur is only weakly 
  rejected by Holtz's data, but is moderately rejected by the new data. A monophyletic 
  Megalosauroidea is very weakly rejected by both, but placing megalosauroids 
  in Carnosauria is moderately rejected by both. Placing <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  in Carnosauria is basically ambiguous in the original matrix and weakly rejected 
  in the new matrix. Placing it as a tyrannosauroid is moderately rejected in 
  the original matrix, but basically ambiguous in the revised one. Placing tyrannosaurids 
  and/or <i>Ornitholestes</i> in Carnosauria is moderately rejected by the new 
  dataset, but the old one moderately rejects either carnosaurian tyrannosaurids 
  or <i>Ornitholestes</i>, but strongly rejects placing both in that clade. Putting 
  <i>Compsognathus</i> sister to Tyrannosauridae as Olshevsky suggested is moderately 
  rejected in Holtz's matrix, and only slightly less rejected by the new one. 
  Making tyrannosaurids and ornithomimosaurs sister taxa is basically ambiguous 
  in the original matrix, but moderately rejected by the new version. Maniraptoran 
  tyrannosaurids as suggested by Sereno are moderately rejected by both matrices, 
  and making tyrannosaurids and dromaeosaurids sister taxa is strongly rejected 
  by both. Having <i>Compsognathus</i> and <i>Ornitholestes</i> outside Tyrannoraptora 
  is basically ambiguous in the original matrix, and weakly rejected by the recoded 
  matrix. Making <i>Ornitholestes</i> and dromaeosaurids sister taxa as in Makovicky's 
  thesis is moderately rejected in the original matrix, and weakly rejected in 
  the new one. Placing <i>Ornitholestes</i> in Maniraptora as suggested by Gauthier 
  is basically ambiguous in both versions. Making <i>Avimimus</i> sister to Ornithomimosauria 
  as in Makovicky's thesis is moderately rejected by the original matrix, but 
  ambiguous in the new one. Bullatosauria is almost ambiguously supported in Holtz's 
  matrix, but moderately rejected in the recoded version. The clade consisting 
  of generally recognized maniraptorans (oviraptorosaurs and paravians) is moderately 
  rejected in the old matrix, and weakly supported by the recoded one. A monophyletic 
  Oviraptorosauria itself is moderately rejected in Holtz's matrix, but basically 
  ambigious in the new version. Making caenagnathids and oviraptorids sister taxa 
  is weakly rejected by the original matrix, and ambiguous in the new one. Making 
  <i>Avimimus</i> a caenagnathid is weakly rejected by both matrices. Making it 
  the sister taxon to birds is strongly rejected by Holtz's version, but only 
  moderately rejected in the recoded matrix. Making ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs 
  closer to birds than dromaeosaurids or tyrannosaurids as Elzanowski suggested 
  is moderately rejected by the old matrix, but very weakly rejected by the new 
  one. Making oviraptorosaurs sister to birds as in Maryanska et al. is strongly 
  rejected by the original matrix, and weakly rejected by the recoded version. 
  Holtz's Arctometatarsalia was only weakly supported in his matrix, and is strongly 
  rejected by the recoded version. His Arctometatarsalia+Oviraptoridae clade was 
  moderately supported by the original codings, and is moderately rejected with 
  recoding. Interestingly, Paraves is strongly rejected by Holtz's matrix, but 
  very weakly supported by the new version. Similarly, Deinonychosauria was very 
  strongly rejected by Holtz's codings, but recoding leaves it almost ambiguous. 
  A traditional carnosaur-coelurosaur dichotomy of Huene, Bakker et al.'s (1988) 
  phylogeny and Russell and Dong's (1994) weird oviraptorosaur-carnosaur topology 
  are all very strongly rejected by the original dataset, but only strongly rejected 
  by the recoded matrix. </p>
