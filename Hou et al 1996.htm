<p>This paper is the first and last attempt by the 'Birds Are Not Dinosaurs' (BAND) 
  group to run a quantitative cladistic analysis. It was one of the earliest works 
  to expose Jehol birds to the west, leaving several of these taxa to be largely 
  ignored by the 'Birds Are Dinosaurs' (BAD) majority until years later.</p>

<p>Oddly, the published figure differs from the matix in adding 'Modern Birds' 
  as sister to <i>Ichthyornis</i> and replacing <i>Cathayornis</i> with Enantiornithes.</p>
<p><b>Taxon issues</b></p>
<p>outgroup- Stated to be <i>Petrolacosaurus</i>, though Hou et al. claim &quot;The 
  use of a coelurosaurian dinosaur like <i>Velociraptor</i> as the outgroup would 
  make no difference for character states.&quot; This will be tested below.<br>
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>- This includes all Solnhofen specimens here.<br>
  <i>Confuciusornis</i>- Only <i>C. sanctus</i> is used here, as <i>C. dui</i> 
  and <i>C. feducciai</i> were still unknown. <i>C. chuonzhous</i> was still considered 
  a <i>C. sanctus</i> specimen, but is so fragmentary and poorly described that 
  its inclusion is irrelevent.<br>
  <i>Cathayornis</i>- Only the <i>C. yandica</i> holotype is used here, as other 
  supposed species were unknown and other specimens' referral has yet to be supported. 
  Notably, the authors might have used the <i>Eocathayornis</i> holotype in their 
  OTU as it was discovered in 1994 and considered a <i>Cathayornis</i> specimen 
  by Martin and Zhou (1997).<br>
  <i>Chaoyangia</i>- Hou et al. referred two additional specimens to <i>Chaoyangia</i>. 
  IVPP V9937 is a partial hindlimb referred to Ornithuromorpha indet. by O'Connor 
  and Zhou (2013), while IVPP V10913 was made the holotype of <i>Songlingornis</i> 
  by Hou (1997). Only the <i>Chaoyangia</i> holotype is used here, though <i>Songlingornis</i>' 
  inclusion will be tested below.<br>
  <i>Hesperornis</i>- Only <i>H. regalis</i> is used here.</p>
<p><b>Coding issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i><b>Petrolacosaurus</b></i> (Reisz, 1981), <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b> (O'Connor 
  and Dyke, 2010), <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) and <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  (Clarke, 2004) do not preserve integument, so can't be coded for the presence 
  of feathers. </p>
<p>2. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve the 
  premaxilla to determine tooth presence, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. 
</p>
<p>3. This character (&quot;Some teeth: present (0); loss of all teeth (1)&quot;) 
  correlates with the previous one and combines maxillary and dentary tooth presence 
  as well. Only dentary tooth presence is coded for here. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> 
  (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve the dentary to determine tooth presence, 
  this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>4. <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> is polymorphic (Howgate, 1984) for constriction 
  between crown and root. <i><b>Confuciusornis</b></i> is inapplicable, being 
  toothless (Chiappe et al., 1999). <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 
  2013) does not preserve teeth to determine constriction, this coding being based 
  on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>5. <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> has a small external naris (Chiappe et al., 
  1999). <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> does not preserve enough of the naris to code 
  (Clarke, 2004). </p>
<p>6. <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> (Paul, 2002) and <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> 
  (Chiappe et al., 1999) have a postorbital. <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b> (Sereno 
  et al., 2002) and <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) are too 
  poorly preserved to code.</p>
<p>7. <i>Hesperornis</i> lacks a manus so cannot be coded for distal carpometacarpal 
  fusion. </p>
<p>8. This character (&quot;Laterally flexible furcula (clavicles)&quot;) is not 
  verifiable in fossils, though the narrow arms in <i>Cathayornis</i> could suggest 
  flexibility comparable to ornithurines, contra Hou et al.'s coding. The seven 
  taxa are recoded unknown. </p>
<p>9. This is a composite of furcular arm width and posterolateral grooving. The 
  latter is used here. <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> (Chiappe et al., 1999) lacks 
  grooving. <i><b>Petrolacosaurus</b></i> (Reisz, 1981) has a grooved posterolateral 
  surface. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve 
  a furcula, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>10. Hou et al. define this character as &quot;Large elongated hypocleidium 
  on furcula (? interclavicle)&quot; but code <i>Petrolacosaurus</i> as lacking 
  it, despite its interclavicle being large and elongated. Here no homology is 
  assumed and taxa with unfused clavicles (<b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> and <b><i>Hesperornis</i></b>) 
  are recoded inapplicable. <i>Liaoningornis</i> has a long hypocleideum (O'Connor, 
  2012). <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve 
  a furcula, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>11. The presence of a concave scapular facet cannot be coded for taxa with 
  sutured or fused scapulocoracoids, so <i><b>Petrolacosaurus</b></i> (Reisz, 
  1981), <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> (Elzanowski, 2002) and <i>Confuciusornis</i> 
  (Chiappe et al., 1999) are recoded inapplicable. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve a scapulocoracoid, this coding being based 
  on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>12. <i>Confuciusornis</i> (Chiappe et al., 1999) lacks a procoracoid process. 
  <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve a scapulocoracoid, 
  this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>13. This character is merely the opposite of character 11, so the six taxa 
  are recoded unknown.</p>
<p>14. Hou et al. define this character as &quot;Broad anterointernal scapular 
  process&quot;, referring to Martin's (1983) misidentification of the acromion 
  in 'sauriurines' as a novel process that articulated medially with a notarium. 
  In actually, the acromial facet is for the furcula, and no non-avian bird is 
  known to have a notarium (except perhaps <i>Apsaravis</i>). Thus <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> 
  (Mayr et al., 2007), <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> (Chiappe et al., 1999) and 
  <b> <i>Cathayornis</i></b> are recoded as lacking this condition. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> 
  (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve a scapulocoracoid, this coding being 
  based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. </p>
<p>15. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) and <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  (Wellnhofer and Tischlinger, 2004) lack an ossified sternum, so should be coded 
  inapplicable for coracoid grooves. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 
  2013) does not preserve a sternum, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. 
  The condition in <i><b>Cathayornis</b></i> has never been described and cannot 
  be determined from figures, so is provisionally recoded unknown. No grooves 
  are visible in <b><i>Liaoningornis</i></b> (O'Connor, 2012), though as the anterior 
  surface may not be exposed, it is coded unknown. </p>
<p>16. <b><i>Liaoningornis</i></b> has a posteriorly restricted sternal keel (O'Connor, 
  2012). <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) and <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  (Wellnhofer and Tischlinger, 2004) lack an ossified sternum, so should be coded 
  inapplicable for keel extent. Similarly, <i>Hesperornis</i> lacks a keel at 
  all (Marsh, 1880) so is also inapplicable. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve a sternum, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. 
</p>
<p>17. This is just the opposite of character 16, so the eight codings are deleted.</p>
<p>18. <i><b>Liaoningornis</b></i> (O'Connor, 2012) has a sternum similar in length 
  to <i>Cathayornis</i>. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) and <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  (Wellnhofer and Tischlinger, 2004) lack an ossified sternum, so should be coded 
  inapplicable for sternal elongation. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) does not preserve a sternum, this coding being based on <i>Songlingornis</i>. 
</p>
<p>19. <i>Liaoningornis</i> (O'Connor, 2012) has gastralia. As only a few dorsal 
  ribs are obvious in <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b>, the presence of gastralia cannot 
  be ruled out. Similarly, only some proximal dorsal ribs are known from the disarticulated 
  <b> <i>Ichthyornis</i></b> specimens. </p>
<p>20. <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> (Chiappe et al., 1999) has ossified uncinate 
  processes. As in the previous character, <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b> and <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> 
  cannot be coded. </p>
<p>21. This character codes for the 'pretibial bone' in birds, which Martin et 
  al. (1980) proposed was a neomorph that fuses to the calcaneum whereas the theropod 
  ascending process was merely an extension of the astragalus. Yet the Thermopolis 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimen shows their interpretation of that taxon's tarsus 
  to be incorrect in that the ascending process broadly contacts the astragalus 
  with no suture and may not even contact the narrow calcaneum (Mayr et al., 2007). 
  Martin et al.'s other example is a juvenile <i>Baptornis</i> described by Martin 
  and Bonner (1977), yet Chiappe et al. (2007) showed a lack of sutures between 
  the ascending process and astragalar body, and no clear reason to homologize 
  the entire lateral condyle with the calcaneum, which could have been much narrower. 
  Thus the only evidence for 'pretibial bones' is embryological, and it is unknown 
  if Mesozoic theropods had a separate ossification center for their ascending 
  process. <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> and <i><b>Liaoningornis</b></i> are thus 
  coded unknown, while <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b>, <i><b>Cathayornis</b></i>, 
  <b> <i>Hesperornis</i></b> and <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> are coded unknown based 
  on a complete absence of tibiotarsal sutures. <i><b>Chaoyangia</b></i>'s distal 
  tibiotarsus is too poorly preserved to even determine the degree of fusion (O'Connor 
  and Zhou, 2013). </p>
<p>22. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) has a proximodorsal ischial 
  process. </p>
<p>23. This character's first two states involve the presence of a 'pubic spoon', 
  a structure proposed by Martin (1991) for <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. In this interpretation, 
  instead of a boot, the pubes are flared strongly transversely and concave posteriorly. 
  Yet this morphology has not been seen in subsequent specimens, including the 
  recently discovered eleventh specimen. Contra Martin et al. (1998) it is not 
  present in <i>Confuciusornis</i> either (Chiappe et al., 1999) and has not been 
  identified in any enantiornithine or other bird. As the state is fictional, 
  it is ignored here and the character only involves a pubic symphysis (0) or 
  lack of one (1). </p>
<p>24. This &quot;posterodorsal crest&quot; on the femur of 'sauriurines' is merely 
  the ectocondylar tuber. <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> (Chiappe et al., 1999) 
  lacks a distinct tuber. The condition is unknown in <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b> 
  (coding in Clarke, 2002) and <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013). 
</p>
<p>25. This character (&quot;Metatarsals: unfused (0); distal to proximal fusion 
  (1); proximal to distal fusion (2)&quot;) assumes knowledge of fusion direction 
  in ontogeny, which is unknown in taxa coded 1 here as no juvenile specimens 
  have been discovered. Thus the states are redefined into an ordered state as 
  usually done- metatarsals: unfused (0); only proximally fused (1); both proximally 
  and distally fused (2)&quot;. <b><i>Liaoningornis</i></b> is stated to have 
  metatarsals &quot;poorly fused&quot; distally (O'Connor, 2012), supposedly like 
  enantiornithines. However, the latter almost always lack distal fusion, so it 
  is conservatively coded 1/2 here. <b><i>Chaoyangia</i></b> only preserves the 
  proximal tarsometatarsus (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013), which is fused, so is recoded 
  1/2. </p>
<p>26. This character codes for a 'tarsal cap' in ornithurines, but this concept 
  is problematic. As Martin (1984) states, the opposite of a tarsal cap is &quot;distal 
  tarsal bones either absent or fused as small individual bones&quot;. Yet there 
  is no way to determine the size of fused distal tarsals, or their sequence of 
  fusion, in taxa only known from adult specimens with fully fused tarsometatarsi 
  (including <i>Liaoningornis</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>, 
  coded by Hou et al.). Thus the seven taxa are recoded unknown.</p>
<p>27. <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> (Mayr et al., 2007) lacks a reversed hallux. 
  <b> <i>Chaoyangia</i></b> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) and <i><b>Ichthyornis</b></i> 
  (Clarke, 2004) do not preserve metatarsal I. The condition in <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> 
  has yet to be described (Middleton, 2003). </p>
<p>28. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) has small pedal unguals. <i><b>Chaoyangia</b></i> 
  (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) and <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> (Clarke, 2004) do not 
  preserve pedal unguals. </p>
<p>31. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981) and <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  (Wellnhofer, 1974) are inapplicable for pygostyle vertebral contribution. </p>
<p>32. <b><i>Petrolacosaurus</i></b> (Reisz, 1981), <b><i>Archaeopteryx</i></b> 
  (Wellnhofer, 1993), <i><b>Chaoyangia</b></i> (O'Connor and Zhou, 2013), <i><b>Hesperornis</b></i> 
  (Marsh, 1880) and <b><i>Ichthyornis</i></b> (Clarke, 2004) lack an ilioischial 
  fenestra, so are coded inapplicable for its size. This leaves <b><i>Confuciusornis</i></b> 
  and <b><i>Cathayornis</i></b>, which may have ilioischial fenestrae, but are 
  coded identically. Even if they were coded differently from each other, this 
  character could not contribute to the topology, so each taxon is coded unknown.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This analysis is hindered by its small 
  size, several characters based on fictional morphologies, others that are the 
  opposite of other characters, and some which are based on developmental assumptions 
  that cannot be coded in adult specimens. This leaves only seventeen characters 
  that are valid and phylogenetically informative. The anatomy of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  has been greatly misunderstood by BANDits for decades, which spread somewhat 
  to <i>Confuciusornis</i>. Hou et al. also ascribed unsupported referred specimens 
  to <i>Cathayornis</i> and <i>Chaoyangia</i>, negating many of the codings for 
  those taxa. <i>Petrolacosaurus</i> was coded 0 for everything, including characters 
  it actually has state 1 for, those which are unpreserved, and even those based 
  on structures it lacks (e.g. ossified sternum, pygostyle). <i>Ichthyornis</i> 
  meanwhile was coded as if it were a complete ornithurine, despite not preserving 
  several elements. These examples show Hou et al. coded taxa as idealized hypothetical 
  examples instead of actual specimens. In total, 43% (110/256) of characters 
  were miscoded, though this is somewhat exaggerated by the several deleted characters. 
  Once corrected, the consensus is-</p>
<pre>|--Petrolacosaurus
`--Eosuchia to Ornithes
   |--Archaeopteryx
   `--Ornithurae
      |--Enantiornithes
      |  |--Cathayornis
      |  `--Liaoningornis
      `--Pygostylia
         |--Confuciusornis
         `--+--Chaoyangia
            `--Ornithuromorpha
               |--Hesperornis
               `--Ichthyornis</pre>
<p>This differs from the original tree in having a paraphyletic 'Sauriurae', though 
  differs from the modern consensus in placing <i>Confuciusornis</i> closer to 
  Aves than enantiornithines. This is no doubt due to the low number of characters. 
  <i>Liaoningornis</i> moved to Enantiornithes, matching O'Connor's (2012) redescription.

<p>In the original matrix, both Pygostylia and Ornithothoraces only take 3 extra 
  steps to enforce, so Hou et al.'s matrix doesn't even strongly reject the BAD 
  topology. The same can be said of Kurochkin's odd idea of confuciusornithids 
  being closer to Ornithuromorpha than enantiornithines. Indeed, the most rejected 
  topology is an enantiornithine <i>Liaoningornis</i>, which at 5 steps is still 
  rather weak. The recoded matrix is basically ambiguous at placing <i>Liaoningornis</i> 
  closer to Ornithuromorpha or in Enantiornithes, and at deciphering the interrelationships 
  of confuciusornithids, enantiornithines and ornithuromorphs. Sauriurae is weakly 
  rejected at 4 extra steps though. The broad conclusion in that the matrix is 
  too small (only 17 informative characters) to strongly reject any proposed hypothesis. 
</p>
<p><b>Experiments with controversial taxa</b>- As noted above, Hou et al. state 
  &quot;The use of a coelurosaurian dinosaur like <i>Velociraptor</i> as the outgroup 
  would make no difference for character states&quot; compared to their supposed 
  use of <i>Petrolacosaurus</i>. If <i>Velociraptor</i> is added, there are in 
  fact nine characters that are coded differently. <i>Velociraptor</i> is known 
  to have feathers (based on ulnar quill knobs) whereas <i>Petrolacosaurus</i>' 
  integument is unpreserved though originally miscoded as known. <i>Petrolacosaurus</i> 
  coincidentally has a dorsolaterally grooved clavicle and proximodorsal ischial 
  process like some basal birds (but unlike <i>Velociraptor</i>), although Hou 
  et al. miscoded these in assuming it was a generic diapsid. <i>Petrolacosaurus</i> 
  is inapplicable for hypocleidium length, anterior sternal groove presence and 
  sternal length (all originally miscoded), due to lacking a furcula or ossified 
  sternum, unlike <i>Velociraptor</i>. <i>Velociraptor</i> has uncinate processes, 
  unlike <i>Petrolacosaurus</i> or even <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  has an ectocondylar tuber on its femur like <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, though Hou 
  et al. view the latter's structure as a non-homologous structure. Finally, <i>Petrolacosaurus</i>' 
  pedal unguals are not enlarged (again miscoded by Hou et al.), but <i>Velociraptor</i> 
  has pedal ungual II enlarged so is polymorphic. If <i>Velociraptor</i> replaces 
  <i>Petrolacosaurus</i>, the tree is the same except that confuciusornithids, 
  enantiornithines and ornithuromorphs are in a trichotomy, allowing the current 
  consensus.</p>
<p>If <i>Songlingornis</i> is included, Ornithuromorpha becomes a polytomy. If 
  its codings are added to <i>Chaoyangia</i>'s, the position of this composite 
  is the same as <i>Chaoyangia's</i>. </p>
<p>If <i>Gallus</i> is added as an example of &quot;Modern birds&quot; as in Hou 
  et al.'s figure 3, it is sister to <i>Hesperornis</i>+<i>Ichthyornis</i>. <i>Songlingornis</i> 
  is also a member of the latter clade if it is included, while <i>Chaoyangia</i> 
  is basal to all of these. In Hou et al.'s figure 3, &quot;Modern birds&quot; 
  are combined with <i>Ichthyornis</i> to the exclusion of <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  and <i>Chaoyangia</i> based on a hypotarsus. Yet <i>Ichthyornis</i> may have 
  the same flat hypotarsal surface as hesperornithines (Clarke, 2004), so this 
  arrangement is unsupported by Hou et al.'s evidence. </p>
