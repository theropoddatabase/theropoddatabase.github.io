  <b>Comments</b>- Paul (2002) proposed Averostra for a clade of "avepods 
  that either possessed at least one accessory maxillary opening in the lateral 
  wall of the antorbital fossa that led into a bony mediorostral maxillary sinus, 
  or descended from such avepods, and are members of the clade that includes the 
  Dromaeosauridae." This included taxa generally recognized as ceratosaurs 
  and tetanurines, but excluded coelophysoids. The definition is here modified 
  to use <i>Dromaeosaurus albertensis</i> (as the eponymous species for Dromaeosauridae) 
  and to specify the promaxillary fenestra (as it is the first accessory maxillary 
  opening to evolve, and the only one present in taxa Paul considers basal averostrans 
  such as <i>Ceratosaurus</i>). <br>
Ezcurra used Averostra for the ceratosaur+tetanurine 
  clade in several papers, and in 2007 with Cuny gave it a new node-based phylogenetic 
  definition with that extent- "<i>Ceratosaurus nasicornis</i>, <i>Allosaurus 
  fragilis</i>, and all the descendants of their common ancestor." However, 
  Paul's apomorphy-based definition is not limited to that clade as promaxillary 
  fenestrae have been identified in <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, <i>Zupaysaurus</i>, 
  <i>Panguraptor, "Syntarsus" kayentakatae</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eodromaeus</span>, herrerasaurines<span style="font-style: italic;">, </span><i>Heterodontosaurus</i> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sacisaurus</span>.&nbsp;
Regardless, Ezcurra's definition has become the consensus and has the
advantage of ignoring the ambiguity of when the promaxillary fenestra
homologous to dromaeosaurids' evolved.<br>

(CPM C2140ZA245; holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuangbaisaurus anlongbaoensis</span>) partial skull (540 mm), partial mandible (Wang, You, Pan and Wang, 2017)<br>

  <b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Hu, 1993) vertical groove in dorsal maxillary process; skull
ornamented with two fan-shaped crests that diverge obliquely and
laterally in dorsal perspective (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>); five premaxillary teeth.<br>
(after Carrano et al., 2012) vertical groove on lateral premaxilla 
  adjacent to contact with maxilla.<br>

  (after Liston et al., 2014) crown angle unusually low for FABL of 15 mm at 50-64 
  degrees; high denticle density on distal carina, producing DSDI of 0.62-0.88.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- (after Young, 1940) teeth irregular in size, laterally compressed with fine mesial and distal
serrations, and curved
distinctly backwards.<br>

(after Young, 1948) gigantic size; maxilla high; teeth with long,
massive root; teeth compressed, sharply pointed and curving backwards;
mesial and distal carinae with fine serrations.<br>
Hu (1993) largely included averostran symplesiomorphies in his diagnosis of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus sinensis</span>
("high, large, and robust skull ...; nasal is oblique and long ...; 13
maxillary, and 13 dentary teeth which are laterally compressed and
possess small serrations anteriorly and posteriorly. Vertebrae are
typically carnosaurian, consisting of 9 cervical, 15 dorsal ... and 36
out of a possible 45 caudals presevered. The coracoid fenestra
penetrates dorsally, scapula is narrow and long, illium is low with an
extended posterior lobe, pubis is longer than ischium...; the humerus
is half as long as the femur, and the tibia is also shorter than the
femur. The femoral fourth trochanter lies medially at a point one third
down the shaft. Metatarsals are parallel, and pes phalanges are robust
with a formula of 2345...")&nbsp; The presence of four incompletely
fused sacral vertebrae is probably ontogenetic, while pneumatized limbs
and a phalanx on pedal digit V are probably errors by Hu.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>-

  Bien (1940) stated the holotype Huangchiatien site was excavated in December 1939, with <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> then listed as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span>-like form".&nbsp; Young (1940) initailly described <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>
as "a much larger Carnosauria is represented by a fragmentary part of
skull, lower jaw and many isolated teeth and limbs."&nbsp; He said "the
general shape of the teeth resemble that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span> and its closely related genera." Another preliminary description is found in Young (1946)- "<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span>
material includes part of a left maxilla with teeth, many isolated
teeth, and a number of articulated skeletons. The maxilla and the teeth
seem to place it very close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span>, both in osteological features and in size."&nbsp; Young later (1948) noted his manuscript describing and illustrating <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>
in detail "was ready for publication at the end of 1943" but delayed
due to WWII.&nbsp; Paratype teeth were found in 1937-1938, but may not be
correctly referred ("since there is only one big Carnosauria found from
the Lufeng area, all the teeth belong apparently to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">triassicus</span>").&nbsp; He described his new taxon as a teratosaurid carnosaur, though <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span> is now recognized as a pseudosuchian.&nbsp; The supposed accessory antorbital fenestrae in both <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>
are due to damage, so that Young's proposed difference in their
comparative height is invalid to distinguish the genera.&nbsp; Nor is the
maxilla of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> taller than <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span>, another supposed difference proposed by Young.&nbsp; His final character of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>' teeth being "rather long stretched" is hard to interpret. Actual differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratosaurus</span>
are the unfused interdental plates, shallow external surface ventral to
the antorbital fossa and more recurved teeth, all shared with KMV 8701
and ZLJT01.&nbsp; Young described and referred a sacrum and pelves (IVPP
V21), but this specimen is a sauropodomorph (Walker, 1964).&nbsp; Referred
dorsal vertebrae IVPP V30 and V31 are also probably sauropodomorph,
comparable to IVPP V100.<br>

Additional jaw and vertebral remians were referred by Young (1951) and
Simmons (1965), though none were done so based on diagnostic characters.&nbsp; IVPP
V504 is comparable in antorbital fossa shape, so is probably
correctly referred.&nbsp;
  IVPP V33 was described by Young as an angular but resembles a prearticular more closely. Young described 
  a partial skeleton (IVPP V100), ilium (IVPP V88) and partial femur and proximal 
  tibia (IVPP V97) as <i>Sinosaurus</i>as
well.&nbsp; Heerden (1977) stated both plateosaurid and melanorosaurid
material was present in these specimens.&nbsp; Young also described
astragalocalcaneum IVPP V73 as a carnivorous dinosaur, and postulated
either it was a hitherto unknown taxon or (at least aprtially
correctly) it "actually represents the only skeletal of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span> and the postcranial skeleton described and tentatively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">S. triassius</span> as V100, V88, V21 etc., belong to a large Plateosaurid still larger than <span style="font-style: italic;">Lufengosaurus magnus</span>."&nbsp;
Welles and Long (1974) considered this an example of their
'ceratosauroid' tarsus type, consisting of non-tetanuran neotheropods
(note it and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span> have their figures switched, so that IVPP V73 is figure 6).&nbsp; While it plausibly belongs to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus sinensis</span> holotype does differ in lacking astragalocalcanear fusion.&nbsp; FMNH CUP 2097 consists of
partial mandibles described by Simmons, who stated they differed from
the holotype in having teeth without mesial serrations and with greater
labiolingual compression.&nbsp; Indeed, ZLJT01 has mesial serrations even on
its first dentary tooth, so FMNH CUP 2097 may be incorrectly referred.&nbsp;
The teeth and centra referred by Simmons have not been described or
illustrated.&nbsp; Until the 2000s, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> was generally viewed as Theropoda or Archosauria indet. with no further descriptive work being done on it.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus sinensis</span>- KMV 8701 was discovered in August 1987 and was first reported in an
anonymous 1989 article in the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shinbun as
Kunming-long, as it was found in the prefecture level Kunming City and
'long' means 'dragon' in Chinese.&nbsp; "The article included three
photographs: one showing the dinosaur in situ, one showing the mounted
skeleton, and a third showing a closeup of the skull" (Tanimoto,
1989).&nbsp; Tanimoto reported this in a short piece for Olshevsky's
magazine Archosaurian Articulations, which provides information from
the newspaper source that has since been shown to be wrong- 400 mm long
skull (actually 525 mm), 52 teeth (actually 62), and "probably a single
crest" (actually the paired crests converge
posteriorly).&nbsp; It was
later featured in Sattler's (1990) popular book misspelled as
"Kumming-long", with the same errors and the tooth number changed to
the still incorrect 32.&nbsp; Tanimoto noted it was similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus</span>, and Hu submitted its description as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilophosaurus sinensis</span>on
June 25th 1991.&nbsp; According to Olshevsky (2000), Dong et al.
(1992) used the name prior to its official publication in January 1993
however.&nbsp; Holtz (DML, 1995) incorrectly reported that the
unofficial
name "Kunmingsaurus" "was mentioned in Archosaurian Articulations some
years back" for this specimen, but Tanimoto's article only calls it
Kunming-long or the "Kunming theropod".&nbsp; KMV 8701 has been
confused
with the popular mounted specimen LDM-LCA 10 discovered in 1994, which
has a longer skull
among other differences. Carrano et al. (2012) believe the differences
are ontogenetic or taphonomic, as the skulls share the the diagnostic
premaxillary groove, a vertical anterior border of the maxilla, and a
similarly shaped and positioned promaxillary fenestra. Currie et al.
(in prep.) ascribe the differences to sexual dimorphism, but this has
yet to be published.&nbsp; In an abstract, Currie et al. (2019) state
"crest
development, anatomy of the femoral trochanters, and ossification of
the tibiotarsus show notable differences between the two specimens.
However, these same characters have been previously described in other
coelophysoids as possible sexual differences. Given that the two
skeletons were recovered from the same stratigraphic level (Zhangjiawa
Member of the Lower Lufeng Formation) and were separated by only 80 km,
it is most parsimonious to conclude that the specimens support the
suggestion that there was strong sexual dimorphism in all
coelophysoids."&nbsp; Wang et al. (2017) noted "complete referred
skeleton ... (LDM-L10) ... is currently housed at World Dinosaur Valley
theme park and catalogd as ZLJT-0057."&nbsp; Stiegler (2019) refers
to the same specimen, saying "<span style="font-style: italic;">'D. sinensis'</span>
(ZLJT-037) has several postaxial neural spines which are "capped" by a
dorsal expansion, but what appears to be paint over the specimen
obscures whether these expansions have the same morphology as
osteoderms in other ceratosaurs" and that it has "ossified tendons
adjacent to the lateral aspect of the posterior dorsal, sacral, and/or
anterior caudal neural spines."&nbsp; Xing (2012 thesis and resulting
publications) has
described two additional partial skulls, ZLJ0003 and ZLJT01, collected
in 2006 and 2007 respectively.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Shuangbaisaurus</span>- Wang et al. (2017) describe partial skull CPM C2140ZA245 from the equivalant Fengjiahe Formation as a new taxon of theropod <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuangbaisaurus anlongbaoensis</span>.&nbsp; Discovered by February 2017, this shares parasagittal crests and a vertical premaxillary groove with <span style="font-style: italic;">"Dilophosaurus" sinensis</span>.&nbsp;
Supposedly distinguishing characters are more posteriorly extensive
crests, posteroventrally angled jugal and reduced supratemporal
fenestrae.&nbsp; Cau (online 2017) correctly noted the former two can be
corrected by realigning the broken skull, while the squamosal and
postorbital could easily be crushed against the parietal to make the
supratemporal fenestra seem small.&nbsp; Currie et al. (2019) concluded all
specimens including <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuangbaisaurus</span> "fall within the range of morphological variability represented by the Kunming and Lufeng skeletons."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Synonymous</span>? Lamanna et al. (1998) doubted <span style="font-style: italic;">sinensis</span> is referrable to <i>Dilophosaurus</i> 
  based on differences in premaxillary shape, tooth count, lack of antorbital 
  tooth row, shape of infratemporal fenestra and squamosal, and size and position 
  of external mandibular fenestra. Dong (2003) first stated it was similar 
  to, and perhaps synonymous with <i>Sinosaurus triassicus</i>, though without 
  citing supporting evidence. Xing (2012) also synonymizes the taxa without evidence, 
  and cites Currie et al. (in prep.) as supporting the synonymy. Liston et al. 
  (2014) noted two dental characters which may be behind this synonymy.&nbsp; Most recently, Currie et al. (2019) stated "the [<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span>]
holotype (especially the maxilla) was studied in detail, and there can
be no doubt that the second skeleton [LDM-LCA 10] is referable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span>."&nbsp;
This may be why Wang et al. (2017) say "only the isolated teeth
referred by Young could be located in IVPP collections during the
length of this study."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"shawanensis"</span>- Olshevsky (DML,
2002) reported that within an incomplete set of pages he had, "On p. 9
and p. 17 the paper notes from the Lufeng Formation the species
Sinosaurus shawanensis (Young) among a number of well-known dinosaur
names."&nbsp; He listed the reference as "Stratigraphy of China,
Jurassic System, Summary, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, May
1979." and attributed the name to Anonymous, as there was no indication
of the author in the pages he possessed.&nbsp; While such a publication
has never surfaced, an identical situation is present in Cheng (1985),
a section of "The Jurassic System of China", volume 11 in the
Stratigraphy of China series.&nbsp; Perhaps Olshevsky's paper was a
summary of this series printed prior to the series itself, which began
in 1982.&nbsp; In any case, Cheng lists "<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus shawanensis</span>
(Young)" alongside other taxa from his layer 5 of the Dark Red Beds of
the Lufeng Formation (equivalent to layer 6 of Luo and Wu, 1994).&nbsp;
Notably this is the only species with the author listed in parentheses,
which would normally indicate a species named <span style="font-style: italic;">shawanensis</span> by Young was transferred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> by someone else, but while Young did name <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span> neither he nor anyone else named a vertebrate species <span style="font-style: italic;">shawanensis</span> (the only animals with that species name before 1985 are brachiopod <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptospirifer shawanensis</span> Jing et al., 1974 and small shelly fossil <span style="font-style: italic;">Phyllochites shawanensis</span> Duan, 1983, neither from the Lufeng Formation).&nbsp; Young (1951) did refer one tooth from Shawan to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> (IVPP V279), but this was to <span style="font-style: italic;">S. triassicus</span>
and was from the Dull Purplish Beds, so doesn't match stratigraphically
with Cheng's taxon.&nbsp; As the holotype and most paratypes of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. triassicus</span>
are from the Dark Red Beds, I think Olshevsky was correct when he noted
"Perhaps it is significant that Sinosaurus triassicus is not listed,
which might mean that&nbsp; Sinosaurus shawanensis is a synonym", as
indeed <span style="font-style: italic;">S. triassicus</span> is not listed by Cheng either.&nbsp; Thus "shawanensis" is near certainly a typo for <span style="font-style: italic;">triassicus</span>, but is still listed here as this can probably not be proven more than thirty years after the fact with the author dead.&nbsp; <br>
Note Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019) represent <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus</span> "shawanensis" with isolated dorsal vertebra IVPP V31, which was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span>
by Young (1948).&nbsp; Yet its size and morphology are similar to mid
dorsals of sauropodomorph skeleton IVPP V100, also referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">S. triassicus</span>
by Young (1951) in an example of that era's habit of combining
sauropodomorph postcrania with jaws and teeth of carnivorous
archosaurs.&nbsp; Contra Molina-Perez and Larramendi, it was not "More
recent than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinosaurus triassicus</span>", being from the Dark Red Beds as well, and has no connection to the name "shawanensis."<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships</span>- Carrano et al. (2012) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">sinensis</span> as a non-orionidan 
  tetanurine, but only three more step remove it from Averostra. Ten steps 
  were needed to place it in Coelophysoidea however, where they recovered <i>Dilophosaurus</i>. 
  As several other relevent taxa were not included (e.g. <i>Zupaysaurus</i>, <i>Dracovenator</i>, 
  <i>Sarcosaurus</i>),
this result is questionable.&nbsp; Larger taxon and character samples were
used by Wang et al. (2017) and Dal Sasso et al. (2018), who recovered
it as the most basal ceratosaur and as sister to Averostra
respectively.<br>

  Marsh, 1888<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Etymology</span>- "<span style="font-style: italic;">medius</span>" is Latin for "moderate", probably referring to its smaller estimated size of "ten or twelve feet in length" compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span> which Marsh had estimated at twenty-five feet long a decade beforehand (Creisler, pers. comm. 1-8-2024).<br>

  1911)<br>

  1911)<br>
  <b>Diagnosis</b>- Provisionally indeterminate relative to <i>Acrocanthosaurus 
  atokensis</i>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Marsh (1888)
initially stated its non-measurement characters as "The teeth are
remarkably flat and trenchant, with the edges finely serrated, and the
surfaces very smooth. The limb bones, and even the phalanges, are
unusually hollow, and the latter have the articulations finely
finished", but these are typical of most theropods with the dental
characters matching most non-maniraptoriforms and dromaeosaurids.&nbsp;
Indeed the syntype limb elements have since been referred to
ornithomimosaurs.<br>
As noted below, Lull (1911) distinguished <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span> from the
type <span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span> based on supposed postcranial differences, but these
elements (Gaucher College 2521, USNM 8502) cannot be referred to the
former species.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1888) originally erected <span style="font-style: italic;">medius</span>
for large theropod material from the Arundel Formation (with small
theropod material being named <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus gracilis</span>), "provisionally
referred to the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>" for no stated reason and with no
explicit difference from <span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span>.&nbsp; He mentions teeth
(including USNM 4972) "and bones of the limbs and feet" of which only
an "astragalus ... 55 mm in width; and 50 mm in fore and aft diameter"
(USNM 5652) and "A first phalanx of the hind foot ... 90 mm in length"
(phalanx II-1- USNM 5453) are specified.&nbsp; The latter two elements
were considered cotypes of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. medius</span> by Lull (1911) who said "Among the
remains referred by Marsh to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span>, the tooth alone may be
with certainty referred to the Theropoda ; the &#8220;first phalanx of the
hind foot,&#8221; surely, and the astragalus, probably, may be relegated to
the ornithopod dinosaurs of the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryosaurus</span>, and, together with
other material, become the cotypes of a new species."&nbsp; They thus
became syntypes of his new camptosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryosaurus grandis</span>, which
became <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus affinis</span> in Gilmore's (1920) work so as not to
confuse it with the preexisting species <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus grandis</span>.&nbsp; As
stated by ICZN Article 74.6, "the first author to have published before
2000 the assumption that the species-group taxon was based upon a
single type specimen is deemed to have designated that specimen as the
lectotype", thus Lull designated USNM 4972 as the lectotype of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span>.&nbsp; Chure (2000) incorrectly includes USNM 5684
and 5704 as "Marsh material so transferred" (and mistypes USNM 5453 as
USNM 4553, which does not exist in their vertebrate paleontology
collection), but these remained syntypes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryosaurus grandis</span>.&nbsp;
Almost none of the historic Arundel dinosaur specimens of Marsh, Lull
and Gilmore had recorded locality data, with most sources simply saying
"Near Muirkirk" (Lull, 1911; Gilmore, 1920).&nbsp; Hatcher (1903)
specified "The exact locality of the Marsh material was certain iron
ore mines on the farm of Mr. William Coffin, and especially in that one
locally known as &#8220;Swampoodle&#8221; and situated about 1 1/2 miles northeast
of Beltsville, on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railway, some 13 miles from
Washington."&nbsp; As shown in Kranz's (1996) Figure 9, the Muirkirk Iron
Works owned by Coffin were about 2.2 miles from the Swampoodle site, so
this description isn't really that specific and USNM Locality 41615
(where the lectotype, and USNM 5685, 5693 and 8503 are cataloged as
from) probably refers to at least this large area.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The lectotype</span>- The type tooth
was discovered by Hatcher between October 17 and December 17 1887
(based on Appendix C of Kranz, 1996 and Marsh's publication
date).&nbsp; Marsh (1888) initially only says "The teeth are remarkably
flat and trenchant, with the edges finely serrated, and the surfaces
very smooth."&nbsp; He then states "One tooth has the crown 30 mm in
height; its antero-posterior diameter at base 15 mm; and its transverse
diameter 77 mm", which marks this specimen as the lectotype
tooth.&nbsp; Hay (1902) moved the species to <span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus</span>, but
unexpectedly did not place <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span> in that genus, instead
saying "The identification of Marsh's <span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus</span> with Leidy's
<span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus</span> ... has been made by Mr. F. A. Lucas, of the U. S. National
Museum" and citing "Marsh, O. C. 1888 A, p. 93. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus</span>.)" in
error as Marsh actually used <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>.&nbsp; Indeed, Hay (1908) later
states "By an inexplicable error the writer&#7495; referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus</span> the
remains described by Marsh as <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span>."&nbsp; Lull says "the
only one of the original cotypes referable to it, the tooth, is one of
the least distinctive features of the skeleton", distinguishing it from
<span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span> based on supposed vertebral (USNM 8502) and phalangeal
(Gaucher College 2521) differences, although each of these elements was
misidentified.&nbsp; Gilmore (1920) wrote "The type tooth has been
carefully compared with teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span>, and with
those of Upper Cretaceous Theropods; but I have failed to find
characters that would distinguish it from any of those genera. In fact
on the basis of a single tooth I believe it is impossible to determine
the genus to which it pertains, and certainly there are not diagnostic
characters available for generic or specific differentiation. In so far
as the type specimen is concerned it will always remain a form of
doubtful affinities."&nbsp; He transferred it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span> "largely
on geographic considerations" as both are from the east coast of the US
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>.&nbsp; Kuhn (1939) explicitly used the combination
<span style="font-style: italic;">Labrosaurus medius</span>, but erroneously in reference to Marsh 1888,
seemingly repeating Hay's 1902 error.&nbsp; Carpenter et al. (1997) in
their <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span> redescription stated "<span style="font-style: italic;">D. potens</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">D. medius</span>, are
based on fragmentary material and only superficially resemble
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>; they should be considered nomina dubia" without
supporting evidence.&nbsp; Harris (1998) wrote "The tooth lacks an
adequate description, and its status is indeterminate."&nbsp; While
Lipka considered several more recently discovered Arundel teeth (USNM
497718, 497722-497726) to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>, at the time he said the
older specimens "have yet to be compared with the new material."<br>
The lectotype has only ever been figured in labiolingual view, with the
best photo by far being that on the USNM online catalog.&nbsp; The
Crown Height ratio is 1.72 while the Crown Breadth Ratio is 0.48, which
is comparable to e.g. the tenth dentary tooth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> NCSM
14345 (1.68, 0.51) that has a Crown Basal Length of 28.26 mm, very
similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">medius</span>.&nbsp; There are 13 serrations per 5 mm mesially and 14.6 serrations distally, within the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> (10-20 mesially, 11.5-17.6 distally).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Referred material</span>- Lull (1911) referred several additional remains to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span>
seemingly because of their smaller size than his new <span style="font-style: italic;">Creosaurus potens</span>,
"by far the largest carnivore known from the Arundel formation"
although it is possible locality played a role as the single element of
<span style="font-style: italic;">potens</span> was discovered in Washington DC instead. Gilmore (1920) stated "While there may be two large carnivorous dinosaurs<span class="gstxt_hlt"> </span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus?
potens</span> (Lull) and <span style="font-style: italic;">D. medius</span> (Marsh) present in the Arundel fauna, I can
see no good reason at the present time for believing there is more than
one, even though, as a matter of expediency, both species are retained
in the present paper. Certainly the scattered teeth and other bones
assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">D. medius</span> indicate an individual or individuals of
sufficient size to have had an anterior caudal of the dimensions of the
type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Creosaurus potens</span>, here referred to the genus
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>."&nbsp; By the next year Gilmore (1921) specified "At this
time <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus? medius</span> rests on a single tooth" and "The few
scattered bones referred to this species by Lull can be assigned, with
equal propriety, to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus? potens</span>."&nbsp; Huene (1932)
explicitly synonymized <span style="font-style: italic;">Creosaurus potens</span> with his <span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus medius</span>,
stating (translated) "<span class="HwtZe" jsaction="mouseup:Sxi9L,BR6jm; mousedown:qjlr0e" jsname="jqKxS" lang="en"><span jsaction="agoMJf:PFBcW;MZfLnc:P7O7bd;nt4Alf:pvnm0e,pfE8Hb,PFBcW;B01qod:dJXsye;H1e5u:iXtTIf;lYIUJf:hij5Wb;bmeZHc:iURhpf;Oxj3Xe:qAKMYb,yaf12d" jsname="txFAF" class="jCAhz ChMk0b" jscontroller="Gn4SMb"><span class="ryNqvb" jsaction="click:E6Tfl,GFf3ac,tMZCfe; contextmenu:Nqw7Te,QP7LD; mouseout:Nqw7Te; mouseover:E6Tfl,c2aHje" jsname="W297wb">Gilmore
(52, p. 121) considers it likely that the teeth and vertebrae, which
are found on the same horizon not far from each other, belong
together."&nbsp; Kranz (1998) having created the nomen nudum
"Capitalsaurus" for the <span style="font-style: italic;">C. potens</span> holotype listed in his Table 3 "large
carnivore" "teeth and various isolated postcrania" as "(possibly "<span style="font-style: italic;">Capitalsaurus</span>"), implying a possible synonymy but it should be noted <span style="font-style: italic;">medius</span> has priority over <span style="font-style: italic;">potens</span>.</span></span></span><br>
Of the "several larger, better preserved teeth", Lull (1911) mentions
"The most perfect is one in the possession of the Hon. Charles E.
Coffin, Muirkirk, Maryland (pl. xiv, figs. 1, 2). It is about 3 inches
(76 mm.) in length and 1 1/8 inches (28.7 mm.) in the anteroposterior
diameter. The crenulations of the margin cease about midway toward the
root on the anterior convex border, but extend the length of the crown
on the posterior edge." Superscript 1 is given as "Or No. 3121, Goucher
College."&nbsp; As the Goucher College collection was transferred to
the USNM in 1916 and no tooth matching Lull's figure exists in the USNM
catalog, it may be lost (unlike other former GC specimens, Gilmore
1920 does not provide a new USNM number either).&nbsp; This tooth is
first figured as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> tooth" by Bibbins (1895) who says it was
"taken from the &#8220;blue charcoal clay,&#8221; and lent for study by Hon.
Charles E. Coffin."&nbsp; Lull also says "one ... (No. 5685, Goucher
College) shows decided wear", but Gilmore (1920) correctly notes
this was "Wrongly attributed to Goucher College as this is the catalog number
of the U. S. National Museum" and this remains true today.&nbsp; This tooth has since been provisionally referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> sp. by Carrano (2024).&nbsp; Gilmore (1920)
states that besides the lectotype, "Other teeth in the U. S. National
Museum Collections are Nos. 5693, 3446, and 8447."&nbsp; Note USNM 3446
is a typo for USNM 8446, which the USNM catalog indicates was
mentioned by Gilmore.&nbsp; It also indicates this and USNM 8447 were
collected by Bibbins in 1894, while USNM 5685 and 5693 were collected
by Hatcher (which according to Kranz' 1996 Appendix C would have been
between October 17 1887 and January 27 1888).&nbsp; Thus when Bibbins
says "In the same beds (&#8220;brown charcoal clay&#8221;) [as the mysterious
<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> tibia noted below]
and at about the same level, were found
fragments of other bones of similar dimensions, and a tooth (Fig. G)
probably belonging to the same individual" the tooth referenced is
probably USNM 8446 or 8447 (note the superscript 3 indicates "The tooth
shown in the figure is not the one taken from this bed" but is instead
Goucher College 3121).&nbsp; Carrano determined USNM 8446 to be "not
well-enough preserved for" two characters found by Hendrickx and Mateus
(2014) to be locally apomorphic for <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> "to be observed, and I consider them indeterminate to clade within Theropoda."&nbsp; <br>
A centrum "(No. 2534, G. C.), which seems to be a posterior presacral",
was regarded by Gilmore (1920) "as being the anterior vertebra of the
sacral series and the plane end (which appears to be sutural) as being
posterior. That it is a sacral is indicated not only by comparison with
the articulated sacral series of No. 4734 U.S.N.M. (<span style="font-style: italic;">Antrodemus valens</span>),
but also by the character of the plane articular end for close
articulation with the centrum which followed it and the rapid widening
of the anterior half of the neural canal."&nbsp; Gilmore states this is
"Now Cat. No. 8502 U.S.N.M."&nbsp; Chure (2000) incorrectly lists this
specimen as "two posterior presacrals."&nbsp; The anterior face is
slightly concave, 85.0 mm tall and 105.0 mm wide, and based on the USNM
catalog photo there are no pleurocoels.&nbsp; It was collected by
Coffin in 1894.&nbsp; <br>
"The anterior caudal vertebra (No. 2614 a, G. C.) is that of a young
individual, as the neural arch had not coossified with the centrum"
(Lull, 1911), and Gilmore notes this specimen is "Now Cat. No.
8503, U.S.N.M."&nbsp; It is slightly amphiplatyan and apneumatic, 92 mm
tall and 101 mm wide anteriorly and 93 mm wide posteriorly.&nbsp; "The
first phalanx of the second digit is represented by the proximal half
(No. 2536, G. C.)" (Lull, 1911) and as noted by Gilmore is "Now Cat. No. 8503,
U.S.N.M.".&nbsp; Its proximal articular surface is 73 mm tall and 58 mm
wide, and as Gilmore says "belongs to the right hind foot."&nbsp; These
two specimens were collected by Bibbins in 1894, and USNM 8503 is
probably what Bibbins (1895) referred to when he wrote "Half a mile
distant [from what is probably USNM 8446] in a bed of similar character
a single vertebra was found which is probably referable to the same
species."&nbsp; Lull also notes "The first phalanx of the third digit
(No. 2521, G. C.) (fig. 2) is entire, most excellently preserved, and
presents a decided similarity to the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus fragilis</span>",
although he states it differs "in being more depressed proximally,
especially in the broader, flatter under surface. Distally, the present
type is not so broad relatively as that of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. fragilis</span>, and the
articular face is more concave transversely."&nbsp; Unfortunately,
Gilmore states "When the Goucher College collection was desposited in
the U.S. National Museum this specimen was missing" although Lull's
figure remains.&nbsp; Lull finally states "There are also two distal
caudals, one No. 5701, the other unnumbered [eventually numbered USNM
6116 as noted by Gilmore], both of the U. S. National Museum
collection", but Gilmore states "their close resemblance to the caudals
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span> appears to indicate their Ornithomimid affinities" and
he referred them to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus affinis</span>.&nbsp; Chure (2000)
incorrectly lists USNM 5701 as the number for both caudals.<br>
Bibbins' (1895) mentions "a tibia, probably of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>, which
measures ten inches in width, and thirty-two inches in length,
exclusive of the ends, which are lacking."&nbsp; There is no other
record of an Arundel dinosaurian tibial shaft from this period, let
alone one over 813 mm in length without preserved ends (longer than
even the 635 mm type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Pleurocoelus altus</span>), so exactly what became of
this is unknown.&nbsp; Kranz (online) says "Last seen at Johns Hopkins
University June 1909. The nearly 3 ft long section of dinosaur limb
bone was excavated by workers in Charles Coffin's iron mines (1895?).

  <b>Holotype</b>- (USNM 3049) (7-10 m) proximal caudal centrum (140.0 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was collected by J. K. Murphy in a Washington 
  D.C. sewer. Comparison with <i>Allosaurus</i>
(Madsen, 1976) indicates that the holotype is probably from the fifth
or sixth caudal vertebra. Based on this, it is probably from an animal
7-10 meters long. Gilmore (1920) referred "The median portion of a very
large ungual (No. 8505 U.S.N.M.) collected by Arthur Bibbins from the
Arundel formation near Contee, Maryland" to this taxon "on account of
its great size". However due to its low curvature it is here
provisionally assigned to Ornithomimosauria.<br>When discussing the <span style="font-style: italic;">potens</span>
specimen in a popular magazine article, Means (1990) wrote "For the
moment the beast is labeled a "dryptosaurus," but it may prove to be a
unique member of the dinosaur family. Local paleontologist Peter Kranz
would like it to be known as "capitalsaurus," Washington's very own
giant reptile."&nbsp; Kranz (1998) latere listed "Capitalsaurus" in his
Table 3 as the name for a
large theropod vertebra, with large "teeth and various isolated
postcrania" listed as "(possibly "Capitalsaurus")".&nbsp; The genus is
a nomen nudum as the quotation marks suggest it was not "used as valid
for a taxon when proposed" (ICZN Article 11.5), and certainly was not
"accompanied by a description or definition that states in words
characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon" (Article
13.1.1) or "accompanied by the fixation of a type species" (Article
13.3).&nbsp; While the vertebra was not specified in the 1998
publication,
Means is discussing "a large vertebra and other bone fragments of a
twenty-foot-long carnivorous dinosaur" discovered in Washington DC in
1898 and Kranz (pers. comm. 8-6-2005) informs me it was meant as a
replacement
name for <i>Creosaurus potens</i>.&nbsp; Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019) published the combination "Capitalsaurus" <span style="font-style: italic;">potens</span> for USNM 3049, as a megaraptorian of "Doubtful identification."&nbsp; While this does establish the name "Capitalsaurus"<span style="font-style: italic;"> potens</span>
in the literature, the genus is still a nomen nudum as the authors
left it in quotation marks and did not explicitly indicate it as a new
genus (Article 16.1).<br>
  <b>Relationships</b>- Comparison to other theropods is difficult due to both 
  the fragmentary nature of the specimen and the few detailed descriptions of 
  caudal centra in the literature. As "Capitalsaurus" was discovered 
  in Cretaceous deposits, it is assumed that the centrum did not derive from a 
  basal theropod such as a coelophysoid or <i>Dilophosaurus</i>, which are only 
  known from the Triassic and Early Jurassic. This species has been referred to 
  <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Dryptosaurus</i> in the past, but is stratigraphically 
  closest to <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>. It will be compared to these three genera 
  first, then to other genera that may be similar. The proximal caudals of <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  are amphiplatyan to slightly procoelous, the opposite of "Capitalsaurus". 
  Also, they are about as wide as tall, sometimes wider, and the ventral edge 
  is much more concave. The ventral surface has a slight groove instead of a keel. 
  Those of <i>Dryptosaurus</i> share the straighter ventral edge and are slightly 
  taller than wide (~1.05 times), but no further details can be discerned. <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> 
  has caudal pleurocoels (like <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>, but not <i>Giganotosaurus</i>), 
  a concave ventral margin and amphiplatyan or amphicoelous centra. The ventral 
  surface is grooved and the centra are 1-1.2 times taller than wide. The only 
  theropod described as having opisthocoelous caudals is the segnosaur <i>Nothronychus</i>. 
  This taxon differs from "Capitalsaurus" in having a median ventral 
  groove, pleurocoels, an autapmorphic posterolateral tubercle, larger chevron 
  facets and being slightly wider (1.16 times taller than wide). Among other segnosaurs, 
  at least <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i> lack opisthocoelous centra. 
  Several theropods are known to lack ventral grooves on the proximal caudals. 
  These include <i>Elaphrosaurus, Carnotaurus, Eustreptospondylus, Suchomimus, 
  Sinraptor dongi</i>, "Alashansaurus", <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i> 
  and alvarezsaurids. Of these, only alvarezsaurids are known have ventral keels, 
  though the condition in most others is uncertain in this regard. Although most 
  other theropods (eg. <i>Ceratosaurus, Torvosaurus, Monolophosaurus, Nedcolbertia, 
  Sinraptor hepingensis, Tyrannosaurus, Archaeornithomimus, Gallimimus, Microvenator, 
  Chirostenotes</i>) are described as having a ventral groove, the condition in 
  <i>Sinraptor dongi</i> at least changes from convex in the proximal caudals 
  to grooved in the mid and posterior caudals. This suggests our knowledge of 
  which theropods have convex ventral surfaces on their proximal caudals is extremely 
  limited, and subject to change as specimens are described more fully. Although 
  alvarezsaurids do have ventral keels, they are otherwise quite dissimilar to 
  "Capitalsaurus" in having strongly procoelous centra. Several theropods 
  are similar to "Capitalsaurus" in having centra over 1.2 times taller 
  than they are wide, including <i>Monolophosaurus</i>, sinraptorids and <i>Bagaraatan</i>. 
  Theropods known to have more circular centra are <i>Ceratosaurus, Carnotaurus, 
  Elaphrosaurus, Torvosaurus, Baryonyx, Piatnitzkyosaurus, Allosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, 
  Carcharodontosaurus, Dryptosaurus</i>, ornithomimids and oviraptorosaurs (which 
  are diagnosed in part by their wide caudal centra). Paravians have distinctively 
  subrectangular centra, so "Capitalsaurus" can be excluded from this 
  clade. The condition found in "Capitalsaurus", where the ventral edge 
  of the centrum is nearly straight, is extremely rare in theropods, being otherwise 
  noted in <i>Dryptosaurus</i>, tyrannosaurids and <i>Bagaraatan</i>. This can 
  vary greatly with position in some taxa such as <i>Bagaraatan</i>, so undue 
  emphasis shouldn't be placed on the character. While clearly not a derived oviraptorosaur 
  or paravian, the current phylogenetic utility of proximal caudal centra does 
  not allow placement more precise than assumed Averostra incertae sedis. 
  While currently unique compared to described theropod caudals, the amount of 
  variation between caudal centra in single specimens is just starting to be revealed 
  (<i>Sinraptor dongi</i>'s ventral groove/keel; titanosaurid's articular surfaces 
  varying from opisthocoelous to procoelous; <i>Bagaraatan</i>'s ventral edge 
  concavity). Because of this potentially high variation, I am extremely cautious 
  as to the taxonomic utility of this caudal centrum and only doubtfully retain 
  it as a valid taxon.<br>

<p><b><a name="Coelurosaurus"></a>"Coelurosaurus"</b> Huene, 1929<br>
  <b>Campanian-Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
  Allen Formation, Rio Negro, Argentina<br>
  Material</b>- (MLP CS 1478) partial ungual (~19 mm)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- <i>Coelurosaurus</i> was listed by Huene (1929) in a faunal 
  list for MLP CS 1478, a partial ungual from the Allen Formation. As Olshevsky 
  (DML, 1999) noted, the name is probably a typographical error for Coelurosauria 
  made when translating the paper from German to Spanish. This is indicated by 
  the fact he never attaches a name to the specimen in the description or plates 
  (it's described under the heading "coelurosaur claw"). Since "Coelurosaurus" 
  was apparently not meant as a valid name when it was published (ICZN Article 
  11.5), it is a nomen nudum.<br>
  The ungual consists of the distal half, which exhibits an interesting combination 
  of features. It is highly curved and transversely compressed, suggesting it 
  is a tetanurine manual ungual or a paravian pedal ungual (though note both <i>Mapusaurus</i> 
  and alvarezsaurids differ in being straighter). The cross section at midlength 
  is triangular (expanded ventrally), unlike the roughtly oval shape of most theropod 
  manual unguals (e.g. <i>Noasaurus</i>, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Deinonychus</i>) 
  or the blade-like shape of <i>Megaraptor</i>'s manual unguals and paravian sickle 
  claws. Yet the shape is not similar to most theropod pedal unguals either, as 
  the ventral surface is concave and the ventral transverse expansion does not 
  flare past the sides of the ungual. Notably, the ungual is quite asymmetric, 
  with one wall of the ventral groove projecting further ventrally. This is more 
  prominent distally, where the groove faces more to the side than downward. The 
  asymmetry and ventral groove are characteristic of abelisaurid pedal unguals, 
  though these are more straight and broad. Noasaurid pedal unguals (as judged 
  by <i>Masiakasaurus</i>) are also straight, are only slightly asymmetrical and 
  are keeled ventrally. <i>Noasaurus</i> itself possesses a controversial ungual 
  most recently thought to be manual which is curved and compressed like "Coelurosaurus", 
  but is not very asymmetrical and has a ventral keel. Another possibility is 
  that "Coelurosaurus" belongs to a bird, as many birds are comparably 
  sized with highly curved pedal unguals. Unfortunately, comparable bird unguals 
  (e.g. <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Soroavisaurus</i>, MACN PV RN 1105) are not described 
  in enough detail to be usefully compared. Huene considered it to be a manual 
  ungual based on its curvature and believed it was a distinct specimen. It is 
  here referred to Averostra incertae sedis due to its Cretaceous age.<br>

  and/or Timimoun), distal femur, incomplete tibia (350 mm)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Lapparent (1957) originally used <i>Elaphrosaurus iguidiensis</i> 
  in three faunal lists- Southern Tunisia (Dahar cliff including Guermessa, Chenini, 
  Remada and Dehibat, and Giado), Northern Sahara (including Alrar, In Akhamil, 
  Djoua, Aoulef and Timimoun) and Southern Sahara (including Tamesna, Agades and 
  Tiguidi). As no other information about <i>iguidiensis</i> was provided, this 
  name fails ICZN Article 13.1.1 ("accompanied by a description or definition 
  that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon") 
  so was a nomen nudum. Among those localities, the only potential material of 
  <i>iguidiensis</i> published earlier are three teeth "of another species 
  of <i>Megalosaurus</i>" (besides <i>saharicus</i>) from Dahar cliff (either 
  Guermessa, Chenini or Remada) mentioned by Lapparent (1951). Lapparent (1960a) 
  later noted caudal vertebrae and fragments of two new <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> species 
  were found in Timimoun and In Tedreft, though the species were left unnamed. 
  Lapparent (1960b) officially named <i>iguidiensis</i>, basing it on remains 
  from fifteen localities which may not belong to the same taxon. The locality 
  of numerous remains was not stated in 1960, though there were four localities 
  listed as having <i>iguidiensis</i>
material (Chenini, Giado, In Tedreft, and Tiguidi: Zinder piste) when
no material was specified as being from them. The caudals were stated
to all be from Abangarit, Ifayen Ignre and Timimoun, so the five
unspecified caudals must come from those areas. A tooth and bone are
from Giado, so the bone is either the femur or tibia.&nbsp; No holotype
was designated, so all 1960b material are syntypes. Which material
should be made the lectotype is uncertain, though the species name
references Tiguidi cliff where undetermined remains from Zinder piste
were found. <br>
  Lapparent (1960b) only differentiated <i>iguidiensis</i> from<i> Elaphrosaurus 
  bambergi</i> due to "constantly lesser size and some accentuated differences", 
  and from <i>Spinostropheus</i> (then <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>) <i>gautieri</i> due 
  to smaller size and "the form of the vertebrae". The figured teeth 
  are recurved and labiolingually compressed with small distal serrations extending 
  along the entire crown and similar-sized (DSDI ~.8) mesial serrations along 
  the apical half in at least the figured Alrar specimen. Elongation ranges greatly 
  between 1.15-~2.7 times FABL. Enamel is unornamented and the crowns are not 
  separated from the roots by a constriction. The two illustrated caudals are 
  elongated (2.23-2.86 times central height) and amphicoelous to amphiplatyan 
  with no transverse processes. The manual ungual from El Rhaz is said to have 
  vascular grooves that are "situated very high and have a very different 
  shape from those of large theropods" and the hindlimb material is basically 
  undescribed. No appendicular material is illustrated. None of the published

  Material</b>- (unknown collection; Futaba-ryu) (~1.5-2 m) partial tibia (~56 
  mm wide)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- This specimen was originally mentioned by Hasegawa et al. (1987) 
  in an abstract as Futaba-ryu, as dinosaur remains in Japan are often given nicknames 
  ending in "ryu" (= dragon). Lambert (1990) inappropriately made it 
  into a genus name, listing it as "Futabasaurus" in a childrens' book. 
  It was mentioned as being a large carnosaur (sensu lato) from Japan that had 
  yet to be described. Dong et al. (1990) referred to it as Tyrannosauridae <i>gen. 
  et sp. indet.</i> and published a photograph. Olshevsky (1991) listed it as 
  an allosaurid without comment, and later (DML, 2001) as a probable junior synonym 
  of <i>Tarbosaurus</i>. Chure (2000) briefly discussed and illustrated the specimen, 
  excluding it from Allosauridae based on a few differences from <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  (lateral edge less elongated ventrally; medial edge not rounded and drawn out 
  medially). While these mean "Futabasaurus" is not <i>Allosaurus</i> 
  itself, they do little to pin down its relationships further. With only a low 
  quality photocopy to go by, I can't make any phylogenetic judgements.<br>
  A genus of elasmosaurid plesiosaur was later named <i>Futabasaurus</i> by Sato 
  et al. (2006), making the name unavailable for the theropod tibia. <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- The associated individual from In Tedreft is the specimen Lapparent 
  (1960) based <i>Inosaurus'</i> diagnosis and species name on, so should probably 
  be made the lectotype if it is redescribed. He also based the taxon on three 
  isolated caudals and a partial sacrum from In Abangarit. They were referred 
  to <i>Inosaurus</i> because of their shorteness relative to their height. In 
  addition, the mid caudal was said to "present some rather close characters" 
  to the proximal caudal, while the sacral centrum proportions were said to be 
  similar. Only the proximal caudal was illustrated. Finally, Lapparent found 
  three caudals described by Stromer (1934) from the Baharija Formation to be 
  similar, without further justification. The referral of the In Abangarit and 
  Baharija specimens to a single taxon, let alone <i>Inosaurus</i>, is dubious.

  <b>Comments</b>- This material was informally called "Katsuyama-ryu",

  of iguanodonts, which are known from the same quarry (<i>Fukuisaurus</i>, described 
  by Kobayashi and Azuma, 2003). Olshevsky (DML, 2000) considered "Katsuyamasaurus" 
  a likely junior synonym of <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, which was discovered later in 
  the same quarry. However, the ulna differs from <i>Fukuiraptor</i> in being 
  straight proximally, with a larger olecranon process and a more prominent and 
  proximally projecting anteroproximal process. The large olecranon process excludes 
  it from Maniraptoriformes, but more precise affinities within Theropoda are

  Material</b>- tooth<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Madsen and Welles (2000) state this was a nomen nudum based 
  on a tooth from the Jurassic of Szechuan mentioned by Huene (1956) on page 481, 
  and later listed by him (1958; p. 205) as a nomen nudum.<br>
  However, the only thing Huene says about <i>Labrosaurus</i> in his 1956 paper 
  is, "<i>Labrosaurus</i> Marsh Teeth, Grooves similar to <i>Ceratosaurus</i> 
  from the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming, of Tendaguru and from Szechuan." This 
  is on the very bottom of page 481, with "Huene, Palaeontologie" in 
  smaller type below, which repeats every eight pages in the volume presumably 
  to separate it into regular sections. Similarly, in his 1958 paper, Huene only 
  mentions <i>Labrosaurus</i> on page 205, where he lists "<i>Labrosaurus</i> 
  Marsh Upper Jurassic Szechuan, China" in his list of coelurosaurs. Thus 
  Huene did not name <i>Labrosaurus</i> "huene", but did refer to <i>Labrosaurus</i> 
  teeth from Szechuan. Chure (2000) states that Huene includes Szechuan in the 
  distribution of <i>Labrosaurus</i>, "an apparent reference to medially 
  ridged teeth described by Young (1942)." Young only mentions <i>Labrosaurus 
  stechowi</i> on page 299, to compare it to <i>Chienkosaurus</i>, noting the 
  latter lacks lingual fluting. <i>Chienkosaurus</i> and <i>Szechuanosaurus</i> 
  are both listed separately by Huene, so he did not intend to sink either into 
  <i>Labrosaurus</i>. Perhaps Huene was referring to fluted teeth from Szechuan 
  (which could be ceratosaurid) or perhaps it was a mistake. It is clear that 
  the species "huene" was a mistake by Madsen and Welles (2000) and 
  never intended as a valid species by anyone.<br>

spine in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>.&nbsp; He believed "The Mangahouanga vertebra would represent a spine placed farther back than the <span style="font-style: italic;">P . bucklandii</span>
caudals, but otherwise are very similar having even the ventral
sulcus", but stated "it is obvious that a single, incomplete vertebra
is hardly a substantial basis for an identification, and although I
think it unlikely, it is possible that the vertebra is of an
ornithopod."&nbsp; It was most recently briefly reviewed by Agnolin et
al. (2010) who stated "This material is phylogenetically uninformative
and is considered here as Theropoda indet."&nbsp; Molina-Perez and
Larramendi (2019) listed it under Megaraptora without rationale,
although this would make sense biogeographically.&nbsp; It is retained
as Averostra here pending further study.<br>
Lindsay's (2001) Spanish translation of his 1991 popular book states
"Este hueso de la cola es suficiente para indicarnos que el dinosaurio <span style="font-style: italic;">Mangahouanga</span>

NZGS CD1 in posterior view.&nbsp; While the italicization and a naive
reading might suggest "... the dinosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Mangahouanga</span>
was ..." and thus qualify this as a nomen nudum, the reversed
adjective-noun order in Spanish leads to a perfect translation of the

correctly indicated as a locality on the New Zealand map next to the
illustration with the specimen merely labeled "Theropod
vertebra".&nbsp; Thus Lindsay never intended Mangahouanga to be a genus
name, and while the translator of the Spanish version or an editor
apparently confused it for a genus name and italicized it, the text
doesn't read as if it's a genus.&nbsp; Thus the accidental
italicization of a word would not count as a nomen nudum here, except
that </span></span></span>
Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019) explicitly listed ""Mangahouanga" (n.n.)" in their list of "Megaraptora similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>",
referencing both NZGS CD1 and Molnar, 1980.&nbsp; They say "its name
was created by accident. Lambert 1983", but while the specimen was
discussed on page 237 of that book as "Late Cretaceous creature from
New Zealand's North Island" and "probably a theropod", it was never
even accidentally named there and the Mangahouang site isn't even
referenced.&nbsp; Molina-Perez (pers. comm., 10-2021) indicates this
was a mistake and he was thinking of Lindsay (2001), but this does make
Molina-Perez and Larramendi (2019) the first reference to explicitly
use "Mangahouanga" as a name, so they are the authors credited
here.&nbsp; It's not listed as "Lambert, 1983 vide Molina-Perez and
Larramendi, 2019" because they never explicitly tie Lambert to the
name, with their format more logically (though incorrectly) implying
Lambert was the one to say its name was created by accident.&nbsp; In
any case "Mangahouanga" is a nomen nudum, as it was not stated to be
new (ICZN Article 16.1- "Every new name published after 1999 ... must
be explicitly indicated as intentionally new"), listed as a nomen nudum
(Article 11.5- "a name must be used as valid for a taxon when
proposed") and lacks a species (Article 13.3- " every new genus-group
name published after 1930 ... must ... be accompanied by the fixation
of a type species in the original publication").&nbsp; <br>

  <b>Berriasian, Early Cretaceous<br>
  Obernkirchen Sandstein, Germany</b><br>
  <b>Holotype</b>- (UM 84; lost) tooth (60x22x? mm)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Naish (2011) reports the holotype is lost. <br>
  This species is based on a single tooth described by Dames (1884) and illustrated 
  by Koken (1887), initially distinguished from <i>Megalosaurus bucklandii</i> 
  in being more transversely compressed and lacking mesial serrations.<br>
  Note abundant additional material was referred to <i>Megalosaurus dunkeri</i> 
  by Dollo (1909) and Lydekker (1888), then <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> by Huene 
  (1926), but has not been described in detail so cannot be compared to the holotypes 
  of either. NHMUK 2559 and 2661 became the holotype and referred specimen of <i>Megalosaurus 
  oweni</i> (Lydekker, 1889 and 1890 respectively), eventually separated as <i>Valdoraptor</i>. 
  Most influential has been Huene's (1923) proposal of the genus <i>Altispinax</i> 
  for "the species described as <i>M. dunkeri</i> by Lydekker (Dames)" 
  ... "distinguished from <i>Megalosaurus</i>
by its enormously high neural spines in the dorsal region" (referencing
three high-spined dorsal vertebrae catalogd as NHMUK R1828), which was
misunderstood by future authors as proposing a new genus for Dames'
(1884) <i>Megalosaurus dunkeri</i>. After decades of 
  both tooth and vertebrae being called <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i>, Paul (1888) 
  formally separated the vertebrae as the species <i>altispinax</i>, resulting 
  in the recent consensus of <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> for the tooth and Olshevsky's 
  1991 new combination <i>Becklespinax altispinax</i> for the vertebrae. The issue 
  was resolved by Maisch (2016), who found the ICZN supported <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> 
  Huene, 1923 as a taxon based on vertebrae different from <i>Megalosaurus dunkeri</i> 
  Dames, 1884 based on the tooth (see <i>Altispinax</i> entry for details). Thus 
  the German tooth is the only specimen that can be referred to <i>Megalosaurus 
  dunkeri</i>. The Hastings Beds specimens contemporaneous with <i>Altispinax</i> 
  are listed under that entry, while the Weald Clay (Belgium, England) and Lower 
  Greensand (England) material is listed as Averostra here. Osi et al. (2010) 
  referred two additional teeth from the Weald Clay.<br>
  Osi et al. (2010) found <i>dunkeri</i> to clade with <i>"Megalosaurus" 
  pannoniensis</i> in a morphometric study, particularly when crown angle was 
  compared to FABL. However, this was based on three teeth from the Weald Clay 
  of England, not the holotype. Ruiz-Omenaca and Canudo (2003) proposed <i>dunkeri</i> 
  was a species of <i>Prodeinodon</i> based on the false conclusion the mesial 
  carina of the latter genus is unserrated, but it is actually serrated in both 
  holotype and paratype (pers. obs.). The lack of mesial serrations in <i>dunkeri</i> 
  may itself be due to wear.<br>

  a tooth from the Oxfordian of Portugal. Lapparent (1943) referred seven teeth 
  (MNHN coll.) from the Solvay Company quarry. Lapparent and Zbyszewski (1957) 
  referred numerous specimens (mostly in the Geological Services Museum of Portugal 
  coll.) from the Callovian-Tithonian of Portugal to <i>M. insignis</i> (including 
  the holotype of <i>Morosaurus marchei</i>), much of the postcrania of which 
  may not be theropod, with at least one caudal series being teleosaurian. As 
  none of the theropod remains have been justified with shared derived characters, 
  and the postcrania cannot be compared to the holotype, all of the material is 
  here removed as Averostra indet. pending further study.<br>

  <b>Santonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
  Glauconite of Lonzee, Belgium<br>
  Holotype</b>- (Muse royal d'histoire naturelle de Belgique coll.) ungual<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Dollo (1883) originally distinguished this ungual from a supposed 
  <i>Megalosaurus</i> ungual from the Weald Clay because it had a less concave 
  proximal articulation with a reduced median ridge, and lacked ventral striations. 
  Although some authors such as Russell (1972) and Molnar (1990) have stated Dollo 
  named the species in his 1883 paper describing the holotype, he only referred 
  to it as the "dinosaurien carnivore de Lonzee". He later (1903) named 
  it as a new species of <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>M. lonzeensis</i>. Huene (1923) 
  considered the specimen an ornithomimid without specifying why, labeling it 
  Ornithomim.gen.Belgium in his phylogram. In 1926, Huene referred to the taxon 
  as Ornithomimidorum gen. A, which has been interpreted as a genus name by some 
  authors (e.g. Glut, 1997). Yet it is only the Latinized way of saying "ornithomimid 
  genus A", to indicate Huene thought a new ornithomimid genus was necessary 
  for <i>lonzeensis</i>, but did not wish to name it. Kuhn (1965) formally transferred 
  the species to <i>Ornithomimus</i>. Russell (1972) considered <i>Megalosaurus 
  lonzeensis</i> an indeterminate possible ornithomimid, but without published 
  reasons. Molnar (1989 pers. comm. to Glut, 1997) believed it was not an ornithomimid, 
  however. Glut (1997) incorrectly stated the species had been renamed ?<i>Struthiomimus 
  lonzeensis</i>, but that combination doesn't appear in any prior work. Carrano 
  et al. (2012) considered it a coelurosaur manual ungual based on "small 
  size, mediolaterally narrow dimensions and details of the vascular traces." 
  <br>
  If the specimen is a pedal ungual, it is most probably from a basal coelurosaur 
  or paravian, as other theropods have pedal unguals which are less curved and 
  broader. Among manual unguals, it resembles <i>Masiakasaurus</i> most closely, 
  as other theropods' are generally deeper and more strongly curved. Of Carrano 
  et al.'s coelurosaur-like features, noasaurids are also small and have mediolaterally 
  compressed unguals (though the amount has not been reported), though the blood 
  groove is deeper proximally and more ventral distally in <i>Masiakasaurus</i>. 
  Traditional megalosaurids like <i>Poekilopleuron</i> and <i>Dubreuillosaurus</i> 
  are similar to other theropods in these aspects. Ornithomimosaur pedal unguals 
  are straight and broader, and further differ in having lateral and medial 'spurs' 
  instead of a flexor tubercle. Ornithomimosaur manual unguals differ in having 
  a distally placed flexor tubercle (except the deep, highly curved unguals of 
  <i>Deinocheirus</i>). They are also characteristic in having a transversely 
  expanded area ventral to the vascular grooves which ends far from the proximal 
  end of the ungual. This is not seen in <i>"Megalosaurus" lonzeensis</i>. 
  These comparisons indicate the taxon is neither a basal tetanurine nor an ornithomimosaur, 
  but may be a noasaurid manual ungual or a deinonychosaur pedal ungual III or 
  IV. <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- <i>Megalosaurus pombali</i> was founded on several different 
  specimens from numerous localities in Middle-Late Jurassic Portugal. Lapparent 
  and Zbyszewski (1957) distinguished it from <i>M. insignis</i>by
its larger size (untrue), greater labiolingual thickness, and mesial
carina restricted to the apical third. The vertebrae are supposedly
united by their strong transverse and ventral constriction. As these
characters have yet to be compared to the wide variety of generic
averostran teeth now known, they are unlikely to be diagnostic, and
the remains could be from multiple taxa. No lectotype has been
selected, but the tooth from Pombal is the obvious choice given the
tooth-based diagnosis and the species' etymology.&nbsp; Mocho et al.
(2016) referred several of the syntype vertebrae to Sauropoda- MG 4811
from Albergaria dos Doze to Sauropoda indet.; and MG 4819, 4821 and
4826 ("A vertebra broken in two but entirely of the same type, although
slightly smaller") from Port de Barros to Diplodocinae indet..&nbsp;
Mocho et al. (2017) found the syntype supposed "very powerful posterior
dorsal (Pl. XIII, fig. 31, 32, 33) whose face has a somewhat less
triangular shape (Torres Vedras Museum)" (MMLT 602528) is a proximal
caudal vertebra of Sauropoda indet..<br>

  Zhao, 1985<br>
  <b>Early Jurassic<br>
  Middle Daye Group, Tibet, China<br>
Material-</b> (IVPP coll?)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1976 (An et al., 2021) and first reported by Zhao (1983) who while discussing 
  the evolution of dinosaurs in China noted "primitive carnosaurs (<i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  Buckland)" in the Early Jurassic. It might be surmised Zhao was referring 
  to an undescribed Chinese specimen of <i>Megalosaurus</i>, which is strengthened 
  by the later mention of a new <i>Megalosaurus</i> species from the same deposits 
  as other Early Jurassic taxa Zhao mentions (<i>Lufengosaurus? </i>"changduensis", 
  "Damalasaurus", <i>?Scelidosaurus).</i> As with other new Tibetan 
  taxa listed by Zhao (1983), it was probably supposed to be described by Zhao 
  in the published version of his doctoral dissertation "The Mesozoic vertebrate 
  remains of Xizang (Tibet), China", in the second Palaeontology of Xizang 
  volume. Yet this volume is only referenced by Zhao (1983; which was submitted 
  in September 1981) and seems never to have been printed, though the previous 
  volume was published by the IVPP in 1980 and the third by the NIGP in 1981. 
  Olshevsky (DML, 1999) notes the IVPP rejected the paper as unpublishable. Zhao 
  (1985) and Zhao and Cheng (1985) list the new species <i>Megalosaurus tibetensis</i> 
  from the Early Jurassic Middle Daye Group of Qamdo, Tibet. It is listed as undescribed 
  ?megalosaurid from the Early Jurassic Daye Group of Xizang Zizhiqu by Weishampel 
  (1990). Zhang and Li (1997) list this theropod as being from the Middle Daye 
  Formation of Daye, Qamdo County, Xizang. The Daye Formation itself seems to 
  be Early Triassic, so a referral to a Daye Group seems more likely. Weishampel 
  et al. (2004) list it as undescribed theropod from the Daye Group of Xizang. 
  It is listed as the megalosaurid <i>Megalosaurus tibetensis</i> Zhao sp. nov. 
  (MS) in Fang et al. (2006), suggesting Zhao's monograph was indeed never published 
  and is still a manuscript. It is probably not referrable to <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  based on the older age, but has not been described or figured so remains a nomen 
  nudum.<br>

  Koken, 1883<br>
  <b>Berriasian, Early Cretaceous<br>
  Obernkirchen Sandstein, Germany<br>
  Holotype</b>- distal pedal phalanx II-2 (~105-145 mm)<br>
  <b>Diagnosis</b>- Indeterminate within Averostra.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Koken (1883) originally identified this as a distal metacarpal 
  IV belonging to the pterosaur genus <i>Ornithocheirus</i>. Meyer and Dames (1884) 
  disagreed, noting that in pterosaurs the distal condyles are much larger than 
  the shaft and that the sides do not have ligament pits. Meyer further believed 
  <i>"O." hilsensis</i>' bone was pneumatic, which he viewed as similar 
  to theropods. Koken and Kayser (1885) replied, stating the morphology could 
  still be congruent with a pterosaurian identity. Williston (1885, 1886) firmly 
  supported a theropod identity, based on his observations of material at the 
  YPM. <br>
  Based on Koken's (1883) figure, the specimen is the distal half of a theropod 
  left pedal phalanx II-2. It is 59 mm long as preserved, probably ~105-145 mm 
  when complete based on proportions in other taxa. It is 32.3 mm broad with condyles 
  37 mm tall. The articular surface is deeply ginglymoid, with both extensor and 
  flexor grooves, the latter more extensive. There is a slight extensor pit. The 
  lateral condyle is broader than the medial condyle and slightly higher in distal 
  view, though both are equal in distal and ventral extent. The condyles are more 
  pointed dorsodistally than ventrodistally and possess large ligament pits on 
  both sides. <br>
  It can be identified as pedal phalanx II-1 because other phalanges are either 
  more transversely flared distally (making their distal profiles wide) and/or 
  more stout. Mayer and Dames were correct to note it strongly differs from pterosaurs 
  such as <i>Pteranodon</i> in having smaller condyles which have prominant ligament 
  pits. These condyles are also slightly dorsally displaced, unlike the strongly 
  ventrally displaced condyles in <i>Pteranodon</i>. It is extremely similar to 
  such taxa as <i>Majungasaurus</i> and <i>Neovenator</i>.
The size is much larger than nearly all coelurosaurs except
tyrannosauroids, meaning it is unlikely to belong to this clade, and it
does not show the dorsally displaced ligament pits of dromaeosaurids.
It may be from any variety of large theropod (neoceratosaur,
megalosauroid, carnosaur, tyrannosauroid) and shows no distinctive
characteristics, leaving it a nomen dubium.<br>

  <b>Holotype</b>- (UWA 82469) (~1.6-2 m) distal tibia (~170-200 mm, 40 mm wide)<br>
  <b>Other diagnoses</b>- The diagnostic characters listed by Long and Molnar 
  (1998) (high rectangular ascending process with straight dorsal margin; centrally 
  placed vertical ridge in astragalar facet; weakly developed medial condyle) 
  are also found in at least <i>Velocisaurus</i> and <i>Austrocheirus</i>. However, 
  differences in the extent and width of the central ridge and other features 
  may provide a valid diagnosis with further study.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- This was originally found in 1967 and identified as chelonian 
  by the NHMUK. It was later repared and reidentified as theropod by Long in 1990s. 
  Rauhut (2005) noted <i>Ozraptor</i> shared a centrally placed vertical ridge 
  in the astragalar facet with unnamed Tendaguru abelisauroid MB R 1750, so referred 
  it to that clade. More recently, Rauhut (2012) found that non-ceratosaurs such 
  as <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>, <i>Aerosteon</i> and <i>Juratyrant</i> also have 
  well-developed ridges, with fainter ridges present in several coelurosaurs. 
  Furthermore, <i>Rajasaurus</i>, <i>Majungasaurus</i>, <i>Pycnonemosaurus</i>, 
  <i>Quilmesaurus</i> and <i>Masiakasaurus</i> lack the ridge, leaving it only 
  known in <i>Velocisaurus</i> and <i>Austrocheirus</i> among named ceratosaurs. 
  Rauhut (2012) placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Ozraptor</span> in Theropoda indet., but here it is in Averostra 
  incertae sedis pending further study, as no non-averostrans survived until 
  the Middle Jurassic or have tall astragalar ascending processes. <br>

  Holotype-</b> (BENC 2/2-001) partial astragalocalcaneum, proximal phalanx I-1(?), partial metatarsal II, phalanx II-1
(115 mm), proximal phalanx II-2(?), proximal&nbsp; metatarsal III(?), distal metatarsal III, proximal
phalanx III-3(?), distal metatarsal IV(?), phalanx IV-1 (104 mm), phalanx
IV-3 (67 mm), phalanx IV-4 (45 mm), partial pedal ungual IV<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after
Serrano-Braas et al., 2020) non-arctometatarsalian pes, where
proximal end of metatarsal III is expanded and has a proximally ovoid
outline (also in abelisaurids); medial condyle of metatarsal II flares
strongly medially; distinctively broad pedal unguals (also in
abelisaurids).<br>
(proposed) posterior surface of distal quarter of metatarsal II with deep groove for <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">m. flexor digitorum longus II tendon.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Many proposed
apomorphies of <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> are only scorable in paratype
specimens, which cannot be referred to the taxon as they lack
diagnostic comparable material.&nbsp; <br>
The following are only scorable in BENC 1/2-0054- strongly curved and
transversely compressed manual ungual I that has
distally placed flexor tubercle divided by deep sulcus; deeply concave
proximal articular surface of manual ungual I, which is twice taller
than wide, giving it an elliptical outline; metacarpal III that has an
expanded proximal articular end, similar in width with that of
metacarpal II.&nbsp; The following are only scorable in BENC 1/2-0092-
distal caudal vertebrae in which dorsoventrally low prezygapophyses
with nearly vertical articular surfaces are found on the more proximal
caudals, and prezygapophyses that face ventromedially are found on the
most distal caudals.&nbsp; <br>
Of the other proposed characters, the supposed attachment site for metatarsal I on metatarsal II is actually a groove for the <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">m. flexor digitorum longus II tendon, which Serrano-Branas et al. confused for the raised scar for the </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">m. gastrocnemius pars medialis in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>, which is also present <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
so was not related to metatarsal I.&nbsp; Metatarsal I actually lacks
an obvious attachment site on metatarsal II in non-bird
theropods.&nbsp; </span></span>"Distal end of
metatarsal III is wider transversely than anteroposteriorly and has a
semi-ginglymoid articular surface" is true of most theropods.<br>
Of supposed diagnostic pedal ungual characters, <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">ventral
 curvature is plesiomorphic and ventral angling with the 
proximal end held vertically is common in theropods and present in e.g. <i>Garudimimus </i>and <i>Beishanlong</i>.&nbsp;
The proximodorsal process "changing its position" is using a difference
between paratype 30/2-001's mostly horizontal processes and the
intended holotype's more vertical process as a character, which
presupposes they are the same taxon.&nbsp; The ventral fossa
surrounding a ridge-like flexor tubercle is also present in <i>Harpymimus</i>, <i>Garudimimus</i>, <i>Beishanlong </i>and
 large Dinosaur Park ornithomimid unguals (NMC 1349, RTMP 1967.19.145) and is not 
shown in the intended holotype but is claimed to be "partially broken."&nbsp;
 This leaves the medial foramen, which might be a valid character in 
paratype ungual III and holotype ungual IV (paratype ungual II is damaged in that area), but might also be 
taphonomic, as there are many other small circular areas of damage (e.g.
 center of proximal surface of ungual IV).&nbsp; </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">While
 the two unguals in 30/2-001 are similar to each other, that of the 
intended holotype is more strongly curved, has that smaller more 
dorsally angled proximodorsal process, is wider in proximal view, and 
lacks the expanded ventral half characteristic of ornithomimosaurs that 
is present in the other specimen.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The material was
discovered in the 1990s and described in a pre-print released online on
April 24 2020.&nbsp; As this was electronic
and had no mention of ZooBank, it was a nomen nudum (ICZN Article
8.5.3. states names published electronically must "be registered in the
Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article
78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself that such registration
has occurred") until August 2020 when that issue was
published physically.<br>
Serrano-Branas et al. (2020) referred four paratype specimens to <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> from different localities in the same formation- BENC
1/2-0054 consists of several manual fragments, BENC 1/2-0092 is several
distal caudal vertebrae, BENC 30/2-001 is two pedal unguals, and BENC
1/2-0091 consists of three forelimb fragments, a distal femur and
distal metatarsal.&nbsp; The latter element is supposed to be a
metatarsal IV, which shares no apparent characters with the distal
metatarsal in the holotype.&nbsp; The pedal unguals of 30/2-001 differ
from the type ungual in several characters besides a supposed medial
foramen in one, which may be taphonomic (see Other diagnoses
above).&nbsp; These specimens are all placed in Ornithomimidae on this
website.<br>
The authors recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> in Deinocheiridae with <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
using the coelurosaur matrix of Choiniere, but this dataset is plagued
by numerous misscorings.&nbsp; Worse yet, most of the authors' reported
deinocheirid synapomorphies don't actually match scorings in their
matrix, suggesting systemic error.&nbsp; For instance, of the supposed
deinocheirid synapomorphies present in the holotype- "an astragalus
with indistinct or poorly separated condyles" and "a dorsoventrally
thicker shaft of metatarsal IV in cross-section" are present in all
scored ornithomimosaurs and indeed most Mesozoic tetanurines; "a less
broad and well-rounded distal end of femur" is an averostran character
again present in most taxa and all ornithomimosaurs; "the presence of
anteroposteriorly short pedal phalanges of digit IV, with proximal and
distal articular surfaces very close together" is scored as true in all
ornithomimosaurs (and abelisaurs and tyrannosaurines among other
taxa).&nbsp; Only "the presence of a rectangular cross-section of metatarsal III" and "a
ventrally concave shape in lateral view of the ventral surface of pedal
unguals" would resolve as joining <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>
in their matrix, but are also both plesiomorphies found in e.g.
abelisaurs.&nbsp; The final character, "a distally-placed metatarsal I
attached to the distal quarter of metatarsal II", is misinterpreted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> as detailed above and is also scored as true for
almost all tetanurines in their matrix, so wouldn't resolve as a
deinocheirid character in any case.&nbsp; <br>
Among material in the intended holotype, the supposed proximal end of
manual phalanx II-2 or III-3 is very poorly preserved but matches the
size and morphology of a pedal phalanx I-1, which would make more sense
preservationally as the rest of the material is from the distal
hindlimb.&nbsp; If the specimen is an abelisaurid, this would also
eliminate the objection that their manual elements are far more robust
than this.&nbsp; Metatarsal fragments are all very poorly preserved,
with only the distal end of III being obviously identifiable, though
two of the other fragments are distal metatarsals.&nbsp; The supposed
proximal end of metatarsal III is particularly broken, and interpreted
by Serrano-Branas et al. as being oval in a strictly extensor-flexor
axis unlike any other theropod.&nbsp; Most Late Cretaceous theropods
had transversely compressed metatarsal III proximal outlines, even
carcharodontosaurids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>.&nbsp;
In addition, these and the wider therizinosauroids have a rectangular
shape in proximal view.&nbsp; The only contemporaneous theropods with
similar outlines are abelisaurids like <span style="font-style: italic;">Majungasaurus</span>,
if the long axis is tilted posteromedially and a medial tip is
added.&nbsp; The pedal ungual is broader than carcharodontosaurids and
coelurosaurs, but comparable to abelisaurids.&nbsp; <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">If added to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix, it emerges as a ceratosaur closest to <i>Aucasaurus </i>as
far as taxa with well preserved feet are concerned, but that matrix
also doesn't include characters particular to ceratosaurs and isn't
great with pedal characters in general.&nbsp; Ceratosaurs are also
unknown from Cretaceous North America, though the idea of an
abelisaurid making its way from South America to Mexico isn't
completely beyond plausibility.&nbsp; Still, I would place the specimen
as </span></span>Averostra<span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;"> incertae sedis pending a better description of the
tarsus and of the real bone surfaces on supposed proximal metatarsal
III.</span></span><br>

  <b>Comments</b>- This taxon was discovered in 1973 and described as a new species 
  of <i>Prodeinodon</i> by Hou et al. (1975), though the paper has yet to be translated 
  from Chinese. Thus the rationale for referring <i>kwangshiensis</i> to <i>Prodeinodon</i>, 
  the purported diagnostic characters, and the descriptive details remain unknown 
  to Western authors. Note the Xinlong Formation used to be called the Napai Formation 
  (Mo et al., 2015). One of the four teeth described by Hou et al. is ~25-45% 
  larger than the others, so may belong to a different individual and make the 
  hypodigm more correctly termed syntypes than a holotype. Okazaki (1992) proposed 
  <i>kwangshiensis</i> might be referrable to <i>Wakinosaurus</i> based on the 
  high labiolingual compression and rather straight distal edge. Mo et al. (2014) 
  noted <i>kwangshiensis</i> differs from the Xinlong carcharodontosaurid tooth 
  NHMG 10858 in being smaller, more elongate (height/FABL ratio 2.61 vs. 1.92), 
  having apically angled distal serrations, and lacking longitudinal ridges along 
  the distal edge. Yet the size and elongation are more variable in e.g. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, 
  so these may not be important factors. Mo et al. (2016) stated "teeth generally 
  similar to those described by Hou, Yeh &amp; Zhao (1975) are fairly common in 
  the Xinlong Formation", illustrating an example as a carcharodontosaurid. 
  <i>kwangshiensis</i> may end up being a carcharodontosaurid, and/or could be 
  synonymous with <i>Datanglong</i> from the same formation.<br>

Camp (1935) described a fragmentary specimen UCMP 32102 from the middle

regarding them as identical" "and prefer to consider the Junghsien
tooth as belonging also to the new form" <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>.&nbsp; This despite previously stating UCMP 32102 "is bigger and straighter than all" <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> syntype teeth.&nbsp; Compared to <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>,
UCMP 32102 is indeed larger (~69 vs. ~32 and ~47 mm), with a much
greater crown height/base ratio (~314% vs. ~224% and

Averostra incertae sedis here.<br>
Dong et al. (1978) list <i>Szechuanosaurus</i> 
  "yandonensis" as a new species in a faunal list of taxa from the Wujiaba 
  quarry of the Shangshaximiao Formation. There is no description or illustration, 
  making this a nomen nudum. In 1983, Dong et al. note there was only a single 
  large theropod skeleton in the Wujiaba quarry, CV 00214, described by them as a neotype 
  of <i>Szechuanosaurus campi</i>. It can be implied that Dong et al. originally 
  believed CV 00214 to be a new species of <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>, but later decided 
  to include it in <i>S. campi</i>. Note that Dong et al.'s attempt at a neotype 
  designation is invalid, as the ICZN requires the original type(s) to be lost 
  or destroyed (Article 75.3.4) and that the new specimen "came as nearly 
  as practicable from the original type locality" (Article 75.3.6) whereas 
  CV 00214 is from a different stratigraphic group than <i>Szechuanosaurus</i>' 
  types and at least one <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span> syntype still exists (Wu et al., 2020). To make CV 00214 a neotype merely due to the suggested undiagnosability 
  of <i>S. campi</i>'s syntypes would require an ICZN petition (Article 75.5).&nbsp; 
  Carrano et al. (2012) found CV 00214 to be sister to <i>Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis</i> 
  in their analysis and referred it to that species.<br>
He (1984) briefly described a series of remains ("many carnosaur
specimens, including many teeth, cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae,
more than forty caudal vertebrae, complete ischium, femur, tibia and
fibula, as well as relatively complete humerus, coracoid and claws"
[translated]) from the Shangshaximiao Formation of Hexi Commune,
Sichuan.&nbsp; He referred these to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>
because the syntypes were also found in the suburbs of Guangyuan and
believed to be from the Shangshaximiao Formation based on faunal
similarities and fossil abundance, "there is no significant difference
in shape and size" between <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>
and the Hexi teeth, and "there is no evidence of the existence of two
or more carnosaurs" from that horizon.&nbsp; However, the teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>
have not been shown to be diagnostic within e.g. Metriacanthosauridae,
multiple taxa with megalosaur-grade teeth are now known from the

characters shared with CV 00214 and He's Hexi Commune tetanurine
material that are largely symplesiomorphies.&nbsp; Notably, the only preserved teeth in <span style="font-style: italic;">S. zigongensis</span> are in the referred specimens ZDM 9012 and 9013, so the type isn't even comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>.&nbsp; Carrano et al.

Referred</b>- ?(IVPP coll.) few teeth (Young, Bien and Mi, 1943)<br>
  <b>Diagnosis</b>- Provisionally indeterminate relative to at least Metriacanthosauridae.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Young's original diagnosis was - "Teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span>-type,
distinctly compressed with anterior and posterior denticulations. They
are pointed and moderately curved."&nbsp; This describes most theropod
teeth including <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span> itself, so perhaps Young intended <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> to be distinct purely based on geography.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>-
The syntype teeth were collected in late Spring 1941.&nbsp; Young
stated they "resemble, in many respects, those teeth described by
Janensch from Tendaguru of Africa", citing Janensch's Theropod Type A
and Type B teeth, which are megalosaur-grade teeth that have not been
analyzed recently.&nbsp; Note Dong et al.'s (1983) Figure 39 is
mislabeled, with 1 being the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span> lectotype V237A and supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
tooth V237B (not V235), 2 being V239 (not V236) and 3 being V236 (not
V238).&nbsp; Also note Wu et al. (2009) were incorrect to state
Szechuanosaurus "was established by Young in 1942 on the basis of four
isolated teeth", not realizing IVPP V238 is composed of pieces of three
different teeth.&nbsp; Wu et al.
(2020) report "we only found one tooth (IVPP V 235) in the IVPP
collections and the others are reported missing."&nbsp; This makes IVPP
V235 an obvious candidate to become the lectotype, although this would
need to be proposed officially and is unfortunate as V236 and 239 were
better preserved.&nbsp; They photograph IVPP V235 in their Figure 5F.<br>
Young states "The denticulations of V238 and V239 are comparatively
finer and the size of them are smaller as compared with those of V235
and V236", but never gives measurements of these densities.&nbsp;
However, the plate would agree with the assessment as IVPP V236 has 12
serrations per 5 mm at midheight distally, IVPP V238A has 17 and IVPP
V239 has ~19 although its figure isn't clear.&nbsp; Wu et al. (2022)
show IVPP V235 has 8.5 serrations per 5 mm mesially at the middle or
base of the crown.<br>

Young placed locality 47 at "the top part of the Kuangyuan Series and
immediately below the Chentsianyen conglomerate", now known as the
Guangyuan Group and the Chengqiangyan Group, with the former
corresponding to the Xiashaximiao Formation through the Penglaizhen
Formation.&nbsp; As it was found "immediately below" the boundary (layer 8b in Young et al., 1943), <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>
may be from the Penglaizhen Formation or slightly lower Shuining
Formation.&nbsp; The age is listed as Tithonian on fossilworks and in
Weishampel (1990), the latter cited as from "Dong (pers. comm.)".&nbsp;
Geographically, locality 47 is "the hill slopes under the so-called
Chentsianyen escarpment S. of the Kuangyuan city", now known as
Guangyuan.<br>
Young et al. (1943) list "<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>
Young" from layer 5b, which is presumably "a few isolated teeth"
mentioned by Young as deriving from locality 49, though they remain
undescribed.&nbsp; IVPP locality 49 is described as being "a few
kilometers N. of the city [Guangyuan] in the hills along the
Chengtu-Sian highway", and the highway connecting Chengdu and Xi'an (as
the cities are now called) is China National Highway 108, or G108.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- Provisionally indeterminate relative to <span style="font-style: italic;">Kaijiangosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- (after Huene, 1932; compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>) centrum wider; narrower ventral surface; ventral median groove wider; transversely narrower prezygapophyses.<br>
While Huene attmpted to distinguish <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> from <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>,
only the wider median ventral groove is apparent in existing photos of
the former.&nbsp; This is compared to the one distal caudal of the
latter figured in ventral view, but as Kobayashi reports grooves become
distally narrower in <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span> while Ostrom reports they become distally wider in <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
groove width is not considered taxonomically distinctive at our current
level of understanding.&nbsp; Indeed, this lack of data is most
relevent to both diagnosing and identifying <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>.&nbsp;
Very few taxa have detailed descriptions of distal caudal vertebrae or
more than lateral views figured, let alone indications of variation
within the distal caudal series.&nbsp; So the facts that <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> share ventrally concave central articulations with <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> in their single anteriorly/posteriorly figured distal caudal vertebra, or that <span style="font-style: italic;">Afromimus</span>, "Grusimimus" and <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>
also have have wide ventral grooves in their few ventrally figured
distal caudals, are not considered taxonomically important.&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Sauvage (1897-1898;
in a section written in January 1898) first mentioned a distal caudal
vertebra he referred to the ornithischian <span style="font-style: italic;">Iguanodon prestwichii</span> (now recognized as the basal styracosternan <span style="font-style: italic;">Cumnoria prestwichii</span>) - "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="" class="">We
are disposed to regard as belonging to the same species the caudal
vertebra of a remote region, the part which we figure under n  7, 8"
[translated].</span></span>&nbsp; Note Galton (1982) was incorrect in
claiming Sauvage reported on this specimen in his 1897 paper (written
December 6), which includes a section on <span style="font-style: italic;">prestwichii</span>
nearly identical to the 1897-1898 one but which lacks the paragraph
describing this vertebra.&nbsp; This could provide a specific date of
December 1897 to January 1898 for the discovery and/or recognition of
the specimen.&nbsp; Huene (1932) correctly noted Sauvage mislabeled
plate VII figure 8 as dorsal view, when it is in ventral view as
understood by the text.&nbsp; Compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Cumnoria</span>,
the caudal is more elongate (length 3.93 times posterior height
compared to 2.54 times at most), has a ventral median groove instead of
a keel, and the prezygapophyseal base in 71% of the anterior central
height compared to ~30-40%, all typical of averostrans.&nbsp; Nopcsa (1928)
recognized its theropod nature and in his list of reptile genera meant
to use a footnote to propose <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>
as a "new name for the piece described and figured by Sauvage (Direct.
Traveaux Geol. Portugal Lisbonne 1897-1898, plate VII, Fig. 7-10) as
late caudal of <span style="font-style: italic;">Iguanodon Prestwichi</span>."&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>
is listed as an aublysodontine megalosaurid (not as an ornithomimine,
contra Galton), roughly equivalent to modern Eutyrannosauria.&nbsp;
However due to a typographical error, the footnote's superscript 1 was
placed after <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>.&nbsp; Sauvage (1929) corrected this in an addendum- "footnote 1 does not refer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span> (line 19 from below) but to <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>
(last line of text)."&nbsp; Unfortunately, Huene missed the addendum,
and thus wrote "Nopcsa recognized in 1927 (43, p. 183) that this was a
coelurosaur and intended to give it a name, but used one already used
by Osborn, namely "<span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>" (91, 1924, p. 3- 7). For this reason, a new name had to be given here" [translated].&nbsp; Huene's proposed new name was <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudocoelus sauvagei</span>, placed in Coeluridae and "somewhat reminiscent of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>."&nbsp;
Huene is also perhaps the first of several authors to place the
specimen in the Kimmeridgian, when it is actually from the Tithonian
(Buffetaut and Martin, 1993; as Portlandian).&nbsp; Galton wrote
"Lapparent and Lavocat (1955: 801) gave a line drawing of the vertebra
after Sauavage (1898) and included it in the section on <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>" and that the specimen "was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>
by Lapparent and Lavocat (1955)."&nbsp; This was perhaps done because
Huene explicitly compared the two, ironically making it the only taxon
distinguished from <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> at the time.&nbsp; Most of Huene's characters cannot be checked in the few published photos of <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>, but the ventral median sulcus is indeed much wider than <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>.&nbsp; Ostrom (1969) was the first author to detail Nopcsa's (1929) addendum, stating "Nopcsa's name <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> has clear piority over Huene's <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudocoelus</span>, but since Nopcsa failed to provbide a specific name, <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> is not valid."&nbsp; Olshevsky (1978) solved this by writing "<span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> has clear priority over <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudocoelus</span>, as noted in Ostrom 1969, and it is certainly a valid generic name. The species <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudocoelus sauvage</span>i is proposed here as the type species of the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>, resulting in the new combination <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus sauvagei</span>
(von Huene 1932) as the proper name of the type specimen."&nbsp; He
also claimed "the specimen itself, unfortunately, was destroyed during
World War II and thus must remain a nomen dubium."&nbsp; This was
repeated by Galton, but as Buffetaut et al. (1991) wrote- "Contrary to
a widespread opinion (expressed, for instance, by Lapparent, 1967), the
vertebra in question has survived two world wars and years of neglect,
like a large part of the other fossil reptile remains in the
collections of the Boulogne Natural History Museum (see Vadet and Rose,
1986)."&nbsp; Olshevsky noted Steel misunderstood Nopsca in a different
way, believing <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Aublysodon</span> was a "name, proposed by Cope in 1869 ... used instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>", as stated under superscript 2.&nbsp; Galton did have the first modern opinion on <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>' affinities, stating "In addition to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>, elongate prezygapophyses occur in the allosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and the dromaeosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
so this caudal vertebra can only be identified as theropod, family
incertae sedis."&nbsp; Buffetaut and Martin (1993) agreed, saying "no
really distinctive characters that would allow a familial assignment
can be observed."&nbsp; Ford (2005 online) gave the type repository as
"Dortigen Museum", but this is a misunderstanding based on Huene's
"Boulogne-sur-mer (Nr. 500 im dortigen Museum)", which
translated is "Boulogne-sur-mer (No. 500 in the museum there)",
referring to the Boulogne Museum where it has always been held.&nbsp;
It was originally number 500, but was recatalogd at some point.<br>
Sauvage lists the vertebra's length as 75 mm and his plate at natural
size would have it be 79 mm, Huene lists it as 11 cm (110 mm) and his
figure at 1:2 size would have it be 152 mm.&nbsp; Galton's drawing with
supposed 5 cm&nbsp; scale would have it be 235 mm, while Buffetaut and
Martin's plate with scale would leave it at 74 mm.&nbsp; As Huene's and
Galton's figures are taken from Sauvage's original plate and the newest
and unique photo matches Sauvage's reported length almost exactly, 75
mm is taken as the correct length.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships</span>- While prior authors haven't specified <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span>' relationships past Theropoda (besides Lapparent and Lavocat's apparent synonymy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>),
there are several ways to narrow down its identity.&nbsp; Only averostrans are known from the Late Jurassic onward, so
coelophysoid-grade taxa are excluded.&nbsp; Some theropod clades were
too small to have a 75 mm caudal, including most non-tyrannosauroid
coelurosaurs besides ornithomimosaurs, therizinosaurs and
eudromaeosaurs.&nbsp; The former two are unknown from the Jurassic, and
additionally paravians like eudromaeosaurs lack any neural spine by the
time the centrum gets as elongate as <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> (e.g. by caudal 12 in <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> at elongation index of 2.4).&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Teinurosaurus</span> has an elongation index (centrum length/height) of 3.9, which also excludes Ceratosauridae, <span style="font-style: italic;">Beipiaosaurus</span>
+ therizinosauroids and oviraptorosaurs.&nbsp; Prezygapophyses basal
depth is significantly less in ceratosaurids, megalosaurids, carnosaurs
except <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>, compsognathids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>.&nbsp; Remaining taxa are elaphrosaur-grade ceratosaurs, piatnitzkysaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span> and basal tyrannosauroids.&nbsp; <br>

  <b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R3717) incomplete distal caudal vertebra (63 mm)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Huene (1932) compared the apoparently long prezygapophyses (based on the 
  depth of their bases?) to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and <i>Ornithomimus</i>, both of which he viewed 
  as coelurosaurs. He felt it "quite possible, if not probable" that 
  <i>Walgettosuchus</i> was an ornithomimid. It has more recently been placed 
  in Theropoda indet., as in Agnolin et al. (2010). As <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> is 
  now considered a ceratosaur and only averostrans are known from the Cretaceous, 
  <i>Walgettosuchus</i> is here placed in Averostra pending further study. 
  While Olshevsky (1991) listed <i>Megalosaurus woodwardi</i> as a junior synonym, 
  he included no responsible author, nor has an earlier work using that combination 
  for the <i>Walgettosuchus</i> material (as opposed to European finds) been located.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- The Cleveland-Lloyd specimens were listed as Unidentified by

  and <i>Marshosaurus</i>. Dalman (2014) referred YPM 58268 to Allosauroidea as 
  a distal tibia, but the broad mediolateral expansion distally and apprent intercondylar 
  notch suggests it may be a distal humerus instead. Similarly, Dalman has YPM 
  coll. as a coelurosaurid [sic] proximal humerus, but Nair (pers. comm., 2015) 
  correctly notes it resembles a proximal ulna more.<br>

from "MAESTRICHTIAN: Mt.

(1986) gave a "caudal (MAPS A1226a, Johnson coll.) from the Wenonah" as
a specimen that had been assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus antiquus</span>.&nbsp; Without more information, whether this is tyrannosauroid, ornithomimosaurian or neither is unknown.<br>

Horner (1979) listed MAPS A1210b from the same localities as <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelosaurus antiquus</span>,
which seems to be the same specimen called MAPS A12106 and MAPS 12106
by Gallagher (1993).&nbsp; Given the notation of MAPS A1226a, it seems
likely A1210b is the correct number, and that the b was transcribed
incorrectly as a 6 by Gallagher.&nbsp; Gallagher states it is "listed
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>? sp.
(phalanx) from Wenonah Formation."&nbsp; Again the similarity between
tyrannosauroid and ornithomimosaur pedal phalanges means its identity
is uncertain until it is described, especially as Gallagher referred

Martin and Brett-Surman (1992 unpublished) report "A small collection
of theropod teeth has been recovered from the Muirkirk clay pit
locality, and presents some interesting characteristics. The collection
includes both premaxillary and maxillary/dentary teeth, with many
crowns intact to the tip. The most consistent feature found in the
maxillary/dentary teeth is the restriction of anterrior serrations to
the top third of the tooth crown. The smaller teeth also exhibit this
feature, but have a carina reaching close to the base of the crown. In
the larger teeth the serrations of the anterrior [sic] surface
terminate abruptly, without any observable decrease in the size of the
individual denticles, and are not followed by a carina."&nbsp; They
determined "A brief analysis of the Arundel clay pit theropod
maxillary/dentary teeth was made using methods outlined in Farlow, et.
al. (1991)" which revealed "that the Arundel theropod teeth cluster
most closely with those of an unidentified Comanchean theropod,
dromaeosaurids, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
(in the figures by Farlow, et. al., 1991). The larger teeth also
correlate with those of an unidentified theropod from the Morrison
Formation."&nbsp; Unfortunately, the existing supplementary document to
Farlow et al.'s paper does not indicate the identity of the Comanchean
(Early Cretaceous), Morrison or supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
teeth, and the pdf of Martin and Brett-Surman's paper doesn't show the
icon for Arundel material, so any further analysis is impossible.&nbsp;
Martin and Brett-Surman figure a pedal ungual in Figure 9 as "Theropod
ungual (USNM 442510), side and dorsal views", but 442510 doesn't
include an ungual and is actually figured on the next page incorrectly
as USNM 442521 (based on the painted label and matching the USNM online
catalog).&nbsp; You might assume the figure captions were switched, but the
online catalog shows USNM 442521 is a non-ungual phalanx.&nbsp; The
ungual shown in Figure 9 is actually USNM 451937 (Carrano, pers. comm. 9-2024).&nbsp; Among specimens figured in this
work, USNM 437629, 442406 and 442442 were all found in 1989.<br>

Frederickson et al. (2018) note regarding USNM 497750-497759 "Theropod
teeth that were highly weathered and abraded were indeterminate, based
on their incompleteness. All of the teeth are small (less than 15 mm
long) and are missing most of their enameled surface. Multiple
fragmentary and abraded metapodial ends and undiagnostic other elements
are also present in the Arundel sample. These specimens are referred to
Theropoda based on their hollow interiors and well-developed collateral
ligament pits."<br>

Carrano (2024) stated the presence of "(1) the mesial margin of
the rounded denticles on the mesial carina is subrectangular, with a
flattened surface [character 89], and (2) the mesiodistal axis of the
mid-crown denticles on the distal carina is inclined apically from the
distal margin in lateral view [character 96]" that were found to be
locally diagnostic to the genus by Hendrickx and Mateus (2014)
"indicates that several isolated teeth from the Arundel Clay could
pertain to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>",
but "Other large teeth in the collection (USNM 8446, 451937, 491732,
497726) are not well-enough preserved for these features to be
observed, and I consider them indeterminate to clade within
Theropoda."&nbsp; However, according to the USNM online catalog USNM 491732
is a specimen of the crinoid <span style="font-style: italic;">Uintacrinus socialis</span> from the Turonian Carlile Shale of Kansas and it was a typo for tooth USNM 497732 assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> by Frederickson et al. (2018) (Carrano, pers. comm. 9-2024).&nbsp; USNM 8446 was previously referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span> by Lull (1911) and USNM 497726 was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> by Lipka (1998).&nbsp; USNM 451937 was found in 1991.<br>

USNM 534099 is in the USNM online catalog as "proximal end of
metapodial" and photographed in distal view, but the broad rounded
outline of one edge of the proximal end is only a good match for the
lateral edge of metatarsal IV among theropods, but is 1.5 times larger
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> AMNH 3015.&nbsp; However given a proximal depth versus total length ratio similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Arkansaurus</span> it would result in a metatarsal length of ~245 mm, well within the range of ornithomimosaurs and thus possibly referrable to <span style="font-style: italic;">grandis</span>.&nbsp;
Note the associated photo has the number 534108 painted on it, but USNM
534108 is a collection of teeth from the cricetid muskrat <span style="font-style: italic;">Ondatra annectens</span> from the Pleistocene of West Virginia.&nbsp; USNM 534099 was discovered in 1995.<br>

Among other USNM specimens listed above, USNM 425732 was found in 1988,
442521 in 1989, 451991 in 1991, 466055 in 1992, 497731 and 487737 in
1998, 535490 in 1999, 540723 and 604986 in 2010, 604957 in 2012, and
540728, 540764 544050, 544051, 544054, 544055 and 544133 from
2010-2013.&nbsp; For NHRD-AP specimens,&nbsp; NHRD-AP 2010.v.014 was found in
2010, 2013.v.678, 2014.s.156 and 2014.v.685 in 2013, and 2014.s.094 in
2014.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- FCM 06/053 (Rodrguez-de la Rosa and Aranda-Manteca, 
  1999, 2000) is a tooth notable for its high DSDI and distal serrations being 
  located inside a groove. Note while one might be tempted to compare this to 
  <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>, which also has a high DSDI and supposedly venom-related 
  grooves, the grooves of the latter are located labially, not distally. <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- This was labeled as "dromaeosaur-like" by Metcalf 
  and Walker (1994).<br>

  It is a premaxillary tooth which is serrated on both carinae, though the mesial 
  serrations do not extend as basally. Serrations are very flat and low with no 
  blood pits. Serration density is 5-6/mm mesially and distally. <br>

  These are all fairly basal characters, suggesting the tooth may come from a 
  basal tetanurine or carnosaur, or perhaps a very basal coelurosaur.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>-
Though Ezcurra and Agnolin (2012) referred MB R 2351 to Abelisauroidea,
Rauhut (2012) noted their listed characters have broader distributions
and are not consistently found in abelisauroids. He regarded it as
Averostra indet., which seems valid as some ceratosaurs (e.g. <i>Quilmesaurus</i>, 
  <i>Majungasaurus</i>) and most tetanurines have similar amounts of distal anteroposterior 
  compression. <br>
OUM J12003 is a tibia which differs from <i>Megalosaurus</i> 
  in being smaller, with a thin fibular crest. Benson (2009) suggested it may be the 
  same taxon as the tetanurine distal tibia MB R 2351. OUM J29776 is a tooth which 
  differs from <i>Megalosaurus</i> in having a much higher serration density- 
  18 per 5 mm mesially and 18.5 per 5 mm mesially. Faint enamel wrinkles are present 
  and the mesial serrations extend 40% of the crown length. OUM J29778 also has 
  fine serrations- 14.5 per 5 mm on both carinae, and has mesial serrations over 
  half the crown length. Both are smaller than <i>Megalosaurus</i> and have interdenticular 
  sulci which are are short and perpendicular to the carinae.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- Lydekker (1888) assigned NHMUK 44806 to <i>Megalosaurus dunkeri</i>, 
  while it was later assigned to <i>Altispinax dunkeri</i> (Huene, 1926) and <i>Megalosaurus 
  sp.</i> (Delair, 1959). NHMUK R 2566 was assigned to <i>Megalosaurus sp.</i> 
  by Woodward (1895). Milner (2002) felt these and three others (NHMUK R 2567 and 
  2821) were closer to allosaurids than megalosaurids based on their higher DSDI. 
  However, <i>Dubreuillosaurus</i> has a comparably high DSDI, so this is not 
  a valid character for distinguishing carnosaurs from basal tetanurines. The 
  teeth are retained in Averostra indet. until they are described in more detail. 
  Neither these nor the pedal phalanx are illustrated. Fowler (2007 online) searched 
  the crocodilian NHMUK remains and found nine teeth that are probably theropod 
  instead. <br>
  The distal metatarsal III was found before 1954 but only described in 2002 by 
  Milner. She tentatively assigned it to the Eumaniraptora based on slenderness, 
  non-arctometatarsal condition and spatiotemporal occurance (earlier than known 
  oviraptorosaurs, which are incorrectly said to be only known from Mongolia and 
  Canada). However, most eumaniraptorans have ginglymoid third metatarsi (<i>Bambiraptor</i>, 
  <i>Velociraptor</i>, <i>Deinonychus</i>, <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, <i>Achillobator</i>, 
  <i>Rahonavis</i>, <i>Shenzhouraptor</i>, <i>Hulsanpes</i>, basal Avebrevicauda), 
  a subarctometatarsus (<i>Pedopenna</i>, <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>, <i>Graciliraptor</i>, 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i>), or both (<i>Neuquenraptor</i>, <i>Microraptor</i>, Troodontidae, 
  <i>Buitreraptor</i>). Possible exceptions are scansoriopterygids, <i>Jixiangornis</i> 
  and <i>Yandangornis</i>, though the former are only known from juvenile material 
  and the latter two are illustrated and described poorly. So contra Milner, I 
  find this metatarsal to most likely not be eumaniraptoran. Many non-paravian 
  theropods can be excluded due to arctometatarsaly or subarctometatarsaly (tyrannosaurids, 
  ornithomimosaurs, mononykines, basal oviraptorosaurs) or ginglymoidy (<i>Compsognathus</i>, 
  <i>Dilong</i>, allosaurids, <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>, <i>Sinraptor</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i>). 
  However, there are still several equally plausible alternatives left for the 
  Purbeck metatarsal, which resembles not only oviraptorids, but also such varied 
  taxa as <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, <i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Tanycolagreus</i>, <i>Ornitholestes</i>, 
  <i>Coelurus,</i> <i>Nqwebasaurus</i>, <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and <i>Masiakasaurus</i>. 
  I recommend classifying it as Averostra indet..<br>

  though Galton and Martin (2002) thought it wasn't a bird. Naish (2000) thought 
  it was very similar to Wessex Formation femur MIWG 6214 except for possessing

  <b>Comments</b>- Sauvage (1898) referred teeth to <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>. 
  Lapparent and Zbyszewski (1957) referred two tooth fragments from the Aptian 
  of Portugal to the same species. but they could belong to any ceratosaur, basal 
  tetanurine, carnosaur or basal coelurosaur.<br>

  (1898), then they and the unguals were referred to <i>Megalosaurus pannoniensis</i> 
  by Lapparent and Zbyszewski (1957). The unguals are not comparable to the holotype, 
  though the measured tooth matches it in labiolingual compression and mesiodistal 
  elongation. Whether any specimens were associated is unknown. <br>

  3.3 and 4.4 of Sauvage's paper (metacarpal I and pedal phalanx IV-?, both from 
  the type), whereas this phalanx is in figure 4.3. The phalanges may belong to

  <b>Comments</b>- Barrois (1875) and Sauvage (1876) described a tooth from Louppy-de-Chateau 
  as <i>Megalosaurus</i>. Sauvage (1882a) briefly described a partial skeleton 
  from there as a new species <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>, referring a large 
  distal femur found in the same area to the same taxon. He later (1882b) described 
  both in more detail and indicated the tooth was also thought to be from that 
  species. Huene (1926a, b) believed the distal femur to come from a different 
  taxon of carnosaur from <i>M. superbus</i>, which he renamed <i>Erectopus</i> 
  in 1923. Huene (1932) later kept the tooth referred to <i>superbus</i>. The 
  tooth is typical of large theropods while the femur has never been illustrated, 
  though both may indeed belong to <i>Erectopus</i>.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- Barrois (1875) and Sauvage (1876) described two teeth and a 
  centrum from Grandpre as <i>Megalosaurus</i>. Sauvage (1882b) referred the teeth 
  to <i>Megalosaurus superbus</i>, and described a supposed distal metatarsal 
  and proximal metapodial from Grandpre as also belonging to <i>M. superbus</i>. 
  Huene (1926a, b) retained all of these in that species, which he had moved to 
  the new genus <i>Erectopus</i> in 1923. He listed both limb bones as metatarsals 
  on page 43, but on page 79 stated the proximal metapodial was a distal fibula. 
  Huene (1932) later kept the teeth referred to <i>superbus</i>, while he kept 
  the limb elements with the <i>Erectopus</i> type material as <i>E. sauvagei</i>. 
  The illustrated tooth and limb bone fragment do not appear particularly diagnostic 
  and may belong to any ceratosaur, basal tetanurine, carnosaur or basal coelurosaur. 
  The centrum and supposed distal fibula may not even be theropodan.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Codrea et al. (2012)
state UBB NgTh1 "may be tentatively attributed to a troodontid-like
theropod because it displays the following characters (Currie et al.,
1990): the crown is less recurved than in teeth ascribed to
velociraptorines, and both the mesial and distal denticles are well
developed (six denticles per millimeter) and hooklike."&nbsp; Yet the
serrations are not nearly as large as derived troodontids, recurvature
is absent unlike serrated troodontid teeth, and the base is lacking so
that root constriction is unknown.&nbsp; The preserved tip is unusual in
being very low (height ~80% of FABL).&nbsp; This is here referred to
?Averostra.<br>

Codea et al. (2002) describe an assemblage collected in 2001, stating
"some fragmentary teeth may be tentatively attributed to
troodontid-like theropods (Fig. 4k), as they display the following
characters: the crown is less recurved than in teeth ascribed to
velociraptorines, both the mesial and distal denticles are well
developed, the mesial denticles extend towards the base of the crown,
distal denticles are wider than long, oblique to the tooth axis and
often hook-like."&nbsp; The figured tooth does not preserve the base to
determine if it had constricted roots, so could easily be e.g. noasaurid instead considering biogeography.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- Found "some time before" 1965, Hooijer (1968) believed this to probably come from <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Note that while
Kellner et al. (2003) initially identified the stratigraphy as "the
uppermost part of the Bidou Formation" based on the 1995 Geological Map
of Iran, "according to the recent revision of the Jurassic stratigraphy
of the southern Tabas Block (Wilmsen et al. 2009) they come from the
Ravar Formation" (Kellner et al., 2012).&nbsp; <br>
Discovered in September 2002, Kellner et al. (2012) noted that "At
least one of the specimens represents the cortex of a long bone that
due to its comparatively small thickness most likely belonged to a
medium-sized theropod dinosaur."&nbsp; The tooth has 3.5 serrations per
mm mesially and 3 serrations per mm distally.&nbsp; Serrations are
described as "straight, longer than wide, and chisel-like" with "blood
grooves ... present as faint impressions, curved towards the basal part
of the tooth."&nbsp; Besides excluding obviously apomorphic taxa like
spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurines and tyrannosaurids, Kellner et al.
(2012) could not specify its relationships further among
theropods.&nbsp; Given its size comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Gorgosaurus</span>
and age, comparisons should be made with ceratosaurids, megalosaurids,
non-carcharodontosaurine carnosaurs, megaraptorans and basal
tyrannosauroids.<br>

  resulting revision of the genus. Sues (pers. comm. 2014) stated these were fragments 
  that showed few diagnostic features once prepared, so their identification remains 
  uncertain. Nessov also tentatively referred a basisphenoid fragment (CCMGE 719/12457) 
  to a segnosaur, but Sues and Averianov (2016) stated it was "too fragmentary 
  for more precise taxonomic identification beyond Theropoda." Given the

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Young (1942) in his
"description of other fragmentary bones" states "As mentioned above
there are a series of cranial and post-cranial bones, mostly
fragmentary, which cannot be attributed to a definite systematic
position with certainty", which seems to reference "A few fragments of
vertebrate fossils recovered also by us during the same trip in Shensi
and Kansu", now known as Shaanxi and Gansu.&nbsp; Thus there is no
stratigraphic data recorded.<br>

Young (1942) describes IVPP V192 as "An anterior part of a centrum with
the breadth 81 mm., middle constriction 50 mm" and notes that "In
ventral aspect, there is a prominent ridge developed" which would make
it an anterior dorsal in most theropods.&nbsp; Its size is comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Neovenator</span>'s type (first dorsal 84 mm wide anteriorly and 50 mm wide at constriction).&nbsp; It was stated to "fit in size with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus ceratosauroides</span>", but not explicitly referred and instead regarded as "Probably a dorsal vertebra of a Theropoda."<br>

Young (1942) states that "One other much bigger bone suggests a part of
jugal" in reference to IVPP V204, the size comparison being to IVPP
V209.<br>

For IVPP V209, Young (1942) states "Of the cranial element there are
two bones with the proximal end expanded and thick. The beam narrows
distally but the tip is broken. There is a ridge developed at the
proximal external part. They can be bestly regarded as the postorbital.
Size fits with the big Theropeda described above" [<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>].&nbsp; The ridge suggests a postorbital boss as in metriacanthosaurids, carcharodontosaurids and tyrannosaurids.<br>

  <b>Middle Jurassic?<br>Jung-Hsein UCMP V1501, middle Chongqing Group, Sichuan, China</b><br>

  <b>Material</b>- (UCMP 32102) (~14.7 m) mesial dentary tooth (~69x~22x? mm), rib fragment, ischial fragment, femoral fragment (~1.33 m)<br>

  <b>Comments</b>-
The specimen was collected on August 30 1915 by Louderback.&nbsp; Note
the
UCMP locality number is V1501 (as determined in their online catalog),
not V151 as listed by Camp.&nbsp; Jung-Hsien is now called
Rongxian, a county in Zigong City.&nbsp; Camp stated "The beds in which
they
occur have been called the Szechuan series", which was a term for the
stratigraphic section from the Early Jurassic Qianfuyan (= Tsienfuyan)
Formation and Ziliujing (= Tsuliuching, = Tzeliutsin) Formation to the
Cretaceous Chengqiangyan (= Chengtsiangyen) Group and Jiading (=
Chiating, = Tshiating) Group, depending on north versus south in the
Sichuan Basin. Rongxian is located in the south, so UCMP V1501 would be
part of the Ziliujing-Chongqing-Jiading sequence, and Young (1937; see
also Young et al., 1943) placed it above the Ziliujing Formation but
below the conglomerates of the Jiading Group, and thus within the
Middle-Late Jurassic Chongqing Group.&nbsp; Furthermore, Young (1937)
stated
"The fossiliferous horizon discovered by Louderback lies probably
between our horizons 2 and 3, some 200 meters above horizon 2" which is
the type locality of <span style="font-style: italic;">Omeisaurus junghsiensis</span>.&nbsp; As <span style="font-style: italic;">Omeisaurus</span>
is generally recovered in the Xiashaximiao Formation and horizon 3 is
another 300 meters above where Young placed UCMP V1501 (so may be the
Penglaizhen or Suining Formation), UCMP 32102 may derive from the
Shangshaximiao Formation.&nbsp; Dong et al. (1983) listed it as deriving
from that formation, perhaps using the same logic although they did not
describe any explanation.<br>

Camp (1935) initially referred the specimen to Megalosauridae because
histology "shows quite definitely that the relationship of the Chinese
form is with <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>" instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>.&nbsp; However, the plate shows this is because the sampled section of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> femur (labeled AMNH 5886, but this is the <span style="font-style: italic;">Anatotitan</span> paratype, and it is more probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamosaurus</span> holotype AMNH 5866 that is known to be histologically sampled) is composed of secondary osteons, while those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> and UCMP 32102 are fibrolamellar bone.&nbsp; Yet <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
can develop secondary osteons where bone is redeveloped as well (e.g.
MHNG GEPI V2567a), so this isn't a real difference between these taxa.&nbsp;
While Camp wrote "a projection of the borders would indicate an
original total length of at least 90 mm" for the tooth, he also
repeated Osborn's 1906 statement that <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
(CM 9380 and NHMUK R7994) teeth are up to 125 mm, which includes the
root.&nbsp; Combined with his statement the serrated distal carina "reaches
the base of the enamel" and serrations are not illustrated on the most
basal section, the actual crown length would have been about 69 mm.&nbsp;
Similarly, Camp wrote "At the base it is 17 mm. in longest diameter",
but scaling the figured tooth to the stated preserved length of 60 mm
results in a FABL of 22 mm instead.&nbsp; Young (1942) later wrote "The
general structure of [<span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>
syntype] V236 with the way of serrations fits so well with the
Junghsien tooth, we feel that there is practically no doubt in
regarding them as identical" "and prefer to consider the Junghsien
tooth as belonging also to the new form" <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>.&nbsp; This despite previously stating UCMP 32102 "is bigger and straighter than all" <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> syntype teeth.&nbsp; Compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>,
UCMP 32102 is larger (~69 vs. up to 63 vs. ~32 and ~47 mm), with a much
greater crown height/base ratio (~314% vs. up to 244% vs. ~224% and
~267%), making it less tapered.&nbsp; The crown section is similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>' fourth dentary tooth and the mid crown ratio of 53% is similar to dentary teeth in <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span> and between <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span> IVPP V238B and 238C.&nbsp; As in mesial teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span>,
the crown is slightly lingually curved and the mesial carina does not
reach the crown base.&nbsp; The same serration densities (mesial 15 per 5
mm, distal 6.7-10 per 5 mm) can be found in <span style="font-style: italic;">S. dongi</span> as well, but are lower than <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>
(distal ~12-19 per 5 mm).&nbsp; Dong et al. (1983) wrote "Camp's description
and the dentition size suggests it may be assignable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus</span>", but it is larger than even the <span style="font-style: italic;">magnus</span>
type (up to 75 mm), and more elongate than the largest maxillary teeth
of the genotype (crown height/base ratio of 267%), but detailed dental
statistics of the genus have yet to be published.&nbsp; The femoral fragment
is notably large, Camp stating the shaft has "an enormous hollow cavity
about 125 mm. in the longest diameter of its ellipse. The greatest
diameter of this segment at its narrowest point is 20 cm."&nbsp; Based on
the absence of a fourth trochanter or medial narrowing, the section is
just distal to the former structure.&nbsp; Here large theropod femoral
shafts are wider than deep, so 200 mm would be the width and the
figured depth is then ~143 mm.&nbsp; Scaling from the largest
metriacanthosaurid, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus magnus</span>,
results in a femoral length of ~1.33 meters, not far from Camp's
"estimated total length of about 140 cm."&nbsp; The ischium "consists of a
moderately hollow shaft spreading into a broader, solid plate", which
could describe most non-maniraptoran ischia, while the "tip of a large
rib" is not described.&nbsp; Notably, the ischium was found 37 meters from
the other material, so its association is less certain.<br>

Given the above information, UCMP 32102 is different from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span> syntypes and anteriorly straighter than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>
as well, and is perhaps the largest known Jurassic theropod.&nbsp; As no
characters are outside the range of ceratosaurids, it is considered
Averostra incertae sedis here.<br>

"during the construction of the Chengtu-Chungking Railway mainly in

Tatienwan, a suburb of Chungking."&nbsp; The latter is "generally
acccepted as
Chungking Series of Cretaceous age" according to Young and Chow (1953),
today called the Chongqing Group and considered of Middle-Late Jurassic
age.&nbsp; Most of the sediments exposed on the surface between
Chongqing and Chengdu are also Jurassic, so fossils discovered
constructing the railway between them are likely also from the
Chongqing Group.&nbsp; Young and Chow referred both to Carnosauria
indet..<br>
Young and Chow called the two dorsals "A small form", stated "Exact
locality unknown" and "think more probable to regard these as belonging
to carnivorous dinosaur."&nbsp; Their length suggests an individual
about 3 meters long, so would probably be a young specimen if their
referral to Carnosauria sensu Huene is correct (i.e. a megalosauroid or
carnosaur), or it may be an elaphrosaurine or coelurosaur.<br>
Young and Chow called the femoral fragments "A large form" and stated
"Its slenderness suggests a carnosaurian" and that the "Transversal
breadth of the distal end, 210 mm."&nbsp; The latter is very similar to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span>'s holotype
femur's distal width of 195 mm, which would make its length 943 mm if
scaled identically.&nbsp; This suggests a neoceratosaur, megalosauroid
or carnosaur.&nbsp; They also state one of the fragments "bears the
label indicating Chien Yang district", now known as Jianyang.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Maisch et al. (2001) figured GPIT SGP 2000/1 as a
carnosaur tooth. Maisch and Matzke (2003) described this and four teeth
from another locality as Carnosauria sensu lato indet., stating "there
are no striking features to indicate that they are derived from more
than one form."&nbsp; Discovered in 2000, Maisch et al. (2001) labeled
GPIT SGP 2000/2 the fibula of a coelurosaur sensu Huene. Maisch and
Matzke (2003) believed it was most similar to <i>Sarcosaurus</i> and 
  <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i>
based on the anteroproximal inclination of the distal articular facet,
referring it to Coelophysoidea or basal Coelurosauria.&nbsp; However,
the
element is dissimilar from theropod fibulae in being significantly and
gradually expanded distally, so it is proposed here to be a distal
ischium instead (e.g. compare to Guanlong). The tooth GPIT SGP 2001/5
was assigned to Coelophysoidea by Maisch and Matzke based on the large
number of serrations (33-37/5mm) and otherwise plesiomorphic
morphololgy, but this is unlikely for a Late Jurassic taxon so it is
here retained as Averostra indet. pending study.&nbsp; Augustin et
al. (2020) revised their stratigraphic assignment from the Toutunhe
Formation to the overlying Qigu Formation, questionably referring the
large teeth to Metriacanthosauridae based on geography although they
did not distinguish them from other carnosaurs, megalosaurids or
ceratosaurids.&nbsp; They stated the small tooth "probably represents a
coelurosaur based on the geological age of the specimen."<br>

first-~twenty-first caudal vertebrae, nine chevrons, ilium (~179 mm),
ischium and incomplete femur (Eberth, Xu and Clark, 2010)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Dong (1992) notes in
1988 before July, the Sino-Canadian expedition collected "small
theropods" in Xinjiang.&nbsp; Dong (1993) specified "In May 1989, a
party under X.-J. Zhao (IVPP), D. Brinkman (Royal Tyrrell Museum of
Palaeontology, RTMP), and D. Russell (Canadian Museum of Nature, CMN)
established a camp near the Pingfengshan locality in the Wucaiwan
region" and "Small theropod skeletons discovered the previous year were
collected."&nbsp; Similarly, Russell and Zheng (1990) said "The lower
part of the Shishugou Formation yielded ... the skeleton of a small
theropod discovered during the 1988 season" at Pingfengshan that was
excavated in 1989.<br>
Russell and Zheng (1990) also reported "Isolated theropod bones,
including claws, were found in the higher levels of this formation"
collected at Pingfengshan in 1989.<br>
Zhao and Currie (1994) mention "an unidentified small theropod" from the same horizon as <span style="font-style: italic;">Monolophosaurus</span>,
which they called the Wucaiwan Formation but has since been joined with
the Shishugou Formation.&nbsp; This is probably the same as "A very
fragmentary specimen of a small theropod that could be new" excavated
by the Sino-Canadian expedition in 1987 mentioned by Dong (1992) and
listed as "Coelurosauria indet."&nbsp; <br>
Eberth et al. (2010) note a skeleton discovered in 2002 as "a third,
unidentified taxon that is neither tyrannosauroid nor ceratosaur" and
thus not <span style="font-style: italic;">Guanlong</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Limusaurus</span>.&nbsp;
They call it "undescribed small theropod" and figure it in situ.&nbsp;
The low dorsal neural spines, squared postacetabular process, slender
and distally expanded ischium and slender unexpanded chevrons through
caudal eleven suggest something compsognathid grade, so perhaps this is
an adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>.&nbsp; Notably
the distal caudal prezygapophyses are deep and ~80% of centrum length,
inviting comparison to coelophysoids and ornithomimosaurs when the
previous characters are considered.&nbsp; Either identification would
be notable temporally.&nbsp; Stiegler (2019) calls it "an as yet
unidentified theropod without a skull or forelimbs" and states "no
vertebrae anterior to C7 are preserved with V15302..."&nbsp; <br>
Discovered by the Sino-American expeditions between 2001 and 2010, IVPP V15858 is called
Morphotype 3 by Han et al. (2011), who refer it to a ceratosaur, basal tetanurine
or basal tyrannosauroid.<br>
Wings et al. (2011) reported that in April 2006 "our excavation was
cancelled prematurely after only nine field days and several partially
exposed bones (e.g., ... a large theropod femur) had to remain in the
field at the "Giant&#8217;s Tomb" site", but in Summer 2006 the quarry "has
been excavated by a field crew from the IVPP (Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing), led by Xu Xing."&nbsp;
Whether the femur was excavated by the IVPP is unknown.&nbsp; From the
upper horizon, "theropod and sauropod teeth which will be published
elsewhere" noted in 2011 were catalogd as PMOL-SGP 2006/2-4 and
described as Theropoda Familia indet. by Wings et al. (2015).&nbsp;
PMOL SGP 2006/2 and 2006/4 have mesial serrations while in 2006/3 a
mesial carina "is not observed on PMOL-SGP 2006/3 (possibly
abraded)."&nbsp; "PMOL-SGP 2006/2-4 possesses 17, 27, and 13 denticles
per 5 mm of the distal carina, respectively", suggesting at least
2006/3 is a different taxon than the other two, but in the absence of

  Tiekuling IVPP locality 16611, Jiangxi, China</b><br>

  <b>Material</b>- (IVPP V2691) incomplete tooth (~43x18x? mm)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 1962 or
1963, while reported as being "from Tiekuling, Taiho district,
Chiangsi", this is now called Tiahe County, Jiangxi, and the only
Google result for 'Tiekuling' is this paper.&nbsp; Google translates the
locality from the Chinese section of text as "<span class="HwtZe" jsaction="mouseup:BR6jm" jsname="jqKxS" lang="en"><span jsaction="agoMJf:PFBcW;MZfLnc:P7O7bd;nt4Alf:pvnm0e,pfE8Hb,PFBcW;B01qod:dJXsye;H1e5u:iXtTIf;lYIUJf:hij5Wb;bmeZHc:iURhpf;Oxj3Xe:qAKMYb,yaf12d" jsname="txFAF" class="jCAhz ChMk0b" jscontroller="Gn4SMb"><span class="ryNqvb" jsaction="click:E6Tfl,GFf3ac,tMZCfe; contextmenu:Nqw7Te,QP7LD; mouseout:Nqw7Te; mouseover:E6Tfl,c2aHje" jsname="W297wb">Que
Pi Ling Water Pond in Taihe County, Jiangxi Province."&nbsp; No
stratigraphic data are given, only that "Its geological age is regarded
as late Jurassic or early Cretaceous."&nbsp; <br>
</span></span></span><span class="ZSCsVd"><span class="azoIfb"></span></span>The
tooth is said to have ~14-15 serrations per 5 mm distally near the tip,
and a greater density near the base.&nbsp; While the text states "Total
length of the tooth is estimated to be 60 mm", the figure would
indicate an estimated length of ~43 mm from the preserved base to their
estimated tip.&nbsp; This makes it comparable in height and FABL to the
estimated tenth maxillary tooth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor dongi</span>,
and the thirteenth maxillary tooth of the latter has 15 serrations per
5 mm near the tip and 20 near the base, also matching IVPP V2691.&nbsp;
Young wrote "the tooth looks very similar to those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>
found in Kuangyuan", the syntypes of the genus, but its shape doesn't
match any of them although the distal serration density falls within
their range (~12-19 per 5 mm).&nbsp; He referred it to Carnosauria gen. et
sp. indet..&nbsp; While the few known details are congruent with a
metriacanthosaurid posterior maxillary tooth, they also match
ceratosaurid dentition, so IVPP V2691 is placed in Averostra indet.

from non-eutyrannosaur tyrannosauroid <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinbeisaurus</span> from that formation,
which has 16-16.2 serrations per 5 mm on both carinae<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Hu (1964) collected
these isolated teeth in 1960 and referred the Maortu specimens to two
morphotypes of Theropoda indet..&nbsp; Note Hu's table gives "preserved
length", but this includes the root as demonstrated by Figures 13 and
14 so that crown length is given here instead.&nbsp; Type 1 have a
crown height ratio of 175-188%, a crown base ratio of 58-59%, 16
serrations per 5 mm on the distal(?) carina and finer serrations
mesially.&nbsp; The mesial tip is said to lack serrations, but this may
be due to wear.&nbsp; Hu states these "resemable [sic], in general form
and feature, to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>"
but differ in that the latter is said to have "distinct anterior
serrations", but at least syntypes IVPP V235 and V236 are stated in
Young's description to have more fine mesial serrations as well.&nbsp;
Type 2 has a crown height ratio of 210%, a crown base ratio of 50%, and
"distinct serrations are on both anterior and posterior borders."&nbsp;
Hu again says "It is resemable [sic] to those teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>",
in the Chinese section specifically noting the measurements are similar
to syntype IVPP V239 - 25x12x7 mm vs. 29x12.5x7 mm.&nbsp; The shapes in
side and basal views are also quite similar, but given the time
difference of Kimmeridgian? vs. Turonian, Maortu specimens are highly
unlikely to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>.&nbsp;
Based on morphology, age and location both Maortu types are likely to
be carcharodontosaurids, pantyrannosaurs or eudromaeosaurs.<br>
The Tashuikou tooth was associated with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilantaisaurus</span>
and said by Hu (1964) to be carnosaurian and "most probably belong to
the same species."&nbsp; Benson and Xu (2008) stated "The tooth
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">C. tashuikouensis</span>
was not found during the course of this study" and placed it in
Theropoda indet..&nbsp; The crown height ratio is 205%, the crown base
ratio is 50% and "There are distinct serrations on front and back
borders."&nbsp; As in the Maortu specimens, it is likely to be
carcharodontosaurid, pantyrannosaurian or eudromaeosaurian.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>-
These specimens were discovered in 1951 and were first reported by
Young (1954) as "many teeth representing at least two forms" of
Theropoda from the "Wangshih series of the Laiyang region", currently
called the Wangshi Group.&nbsp; Young and Sun (1957) referred to them
as "teeth of Laiyang referred to Szechuanosaurus", later calling them
"tentatively referred to Szechuanosaurus" and noting their serration
density is similar to Kalaza dentary IVPP V903.&nbsp; Young (1958)
figured the teeth and described them in detail, most being from Hsikou
(now Xigou) (IVPP V757-761, V764-766; with V756 "from the place not far
from the opening of the valley and therefore probably derived from the
excavated locality") and three others from "some places near the
village Chingkankou" (now Jingangkou).&nbsp; and referred these to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span> because they have mesial serrations unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Prodeinodon</span> and are larger than <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus</span>.&nbsp; Wu et al. (2020) note these teeth have finer serrations (12-13 per 5 mm) than <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>
(8.5 per 5 mm) so "cannot be assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span> of the Upper
Jurassic."&nbsp; Based on their age, these teeth are more likely
tyrannosauroid or dromaeosaurid.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The AMNH specimens
listed here are from the online catalog, which generally lacks
identification for ranks between order and family so that Theropoda
indet. material is listed as Saurischia.&nbsp; Yet none of the
specimens are likely to be sauropods given Gilmore (1933) never
mentioned finding any and to this day only a few elements have been
reported (4 in the Erenhot Dinosaur Museum coll., 7 from the
Sino-Soviet expedition- Currie and Eberth, 1993; <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonidosaurus</span>).&nbsp;
Most would have been found during the April 22 to May 25 1923 Central
Asiatic Expedition, AMNH 6556 on April 30.&nbsp; The online catalog
also specifies AMNH 6756 was discovered in AMNH site 141.&nbsp; Many of
these specimens (AMNH 6556, 30245, 30247-30260, 30298-30299, 30360,
80277) are listed as being from "8 mi. E. of station" which would place
them among Third Asiatic Expedition field sites 140-149, with AMNH 6757
listed as 9 miles east, so perhaps site 149.&nbsp; One exception is
AMNH 6744, stated as being found at Elephant Camp (12 miles NW of the
station) by de Chardin, who was only on the 1930 expedition.&nbsp;
Based on the elements preserved, specimen numbers and locality of "8
mi. E. of station", sevcral specimens (AMNH 30245, 30247-30260,
30298-30299, 30360) may belong to the two(+?) troodontid individuals
noted in the AMNH online catalog represented by specimen numbers AMNH
30261-30297, 30300-30318, 30320-30330 and 30336-30359.<br>
Chow and Rozhdestvensky (1960) noted "three partially complete
skeletons of some small carnosaurian dinosaurs" discovered in the
June-July 1959 Sino-Soviet expedition, perhaps indicating
tyrannosauroids or dromaeosaurids.&nbsp; Currie and Eberth (1993)
stated "A rough tally of Sino-Soviet field identifications shows that
... 'theropods' (including large theropods, small theropods and
segnosaurs, but not ornithomimids) were more common (400 specimens)."<br>

  <b>Material</b>- (FPDM uncatalogd; formerly part of FPDM-V-8461) distal caudal
vertebra<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was originally
assigned to the holotype of "Fukuivenator" by Azuma et
al. (2016), who identified thirty caudals before Hattori et al. (2021)
identified the fourth and twenty-ninth caudals while listing a distal
caudal as one of three "Withdrawn elements" without further
comment.&nbsp; Hattori (pers. comm., 3-4-2022) indicates this caudal is
theropodan but was incorrectly associated with the holotype block due
to similarities in its field number, but that it currently has no
specimen number.<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- These remains were stated to be like <i>Allosaurus</i> by Tamara 
  et al. (1991), though Chure (2000) thought they were different enough to be 
  excluded from Allosauridae. A femur was associated with the dorsal neural arches 
  and fibula, but Chure correctly notes it resembles pterosaurs more. The teeth 
  differ from <i>Allosaurus</i> in being taller with straight posterior margins. 
  The neural arches differ in having lower and thinner neural spines. The tibia 
  and fibulae are too damaged to be useful. The distal metatarsals differ in being 
  transversely wider, with larger rounder flexor depressions and less cranioproximally 
  extensive distal articular surfaces.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Buffetaut (1983)
reported "additional remains of ... theropods" found in 1981 "at Phu
Wieng", which was clarified to be "Theropoda indet. : teeth" from Phu
Wiang 3 by Martin et al. (1999).&nbsp; <br>


Buffetaut and Ingavat (1983) reported teeth "of the usual carnosaur
type : strongly compressed blade-like teeth with smooth enamel and
serrated cutting edges" in addition to what would be described as <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamosaurus</span>
by Buffetaut and Ingavat (1986) from the Phu Wiang 1A locality.&nbsp;
The latter reference figures one such tooth as "a "normal" carnosaur
from the same locality." <br>


Buffetaut and Suteethorn (1989) noted about ten teeth found in 1987 associated with what would be described as the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Phuwiangosaurus</span>
in 1994, at Phu Wiang 3.&nbsp; These "exhibit the characteristic
morphology of carnosaur teeth: the crown is strongly compressed
laterally, recurved, with sharp, finely serrated cutting edges" and
one tooth is photographed.<br>


Suteethorn et al. (1995) reported a tooth associated with a <span style="font-style: italic;">Phuwiangosaurus</span>
skeleton (SM K11-0001 to SM K11-0167) from Phu Wiang 11, which was
figured when that specimen was described by Suteethorn et al.
(2009).&nbsp; <br>


Martin et al. (1999) listed several occurances of Theropoda indet. from various localities in the Sao Khua Formation.<br>


Chanthasit et al. (2019) report "a large isolated tooth with serration
and manual claws of indeterminate theropods" from the Phu Sung locality.<br>


Tong et al. (2019) reported a "large caudal vertebra lacking the neural
spine" and "several blade-shaped, laterally compressed teeth with
serrated carinae" from Phu Din Daeng, one of the latter which was
figured.<br>


While it's been suggested some of these teeth belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Siamotyrannus</span> (e.g. Buffetaut and Suteethorn, 1998), <span style="font-style: italic;">Phuwiangvenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Vayuraptor</span> have since been described from the formation and likely had similar teeth.&nbsp; <br>

initially reported "a theropod tooth and a quadrate which probably also
belongs to a theropod (P. Taquet, pers. comm.)" discovered in

can be referred to a theropod dinosaur", while Buffetaut and Suteethorn
(1992) said "scanty remains of theropod dinosaurs (including teeth and
fragmentary bones)" were known.&nbsp; These reports may all refer back
to Buffetaut's tooth and quadrate and are from the Ban Khok Kruat
locality.<br>

Buffetaut et al. (2005) wrote "isolated teeth are relatively common at
several localities. At Khok Pa Suam (Ubon Ratchathani Province), a
number of blade-like teeth, with serrations on both margins, have been
collected. Differences in size and morphology strongly suggest that
several taxa are present, with at least a large form and a smaller one."<br>

which may indicate these are all personal communications or unpublished

  <b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in 2010, Haddoumi et al. (2015) stated "A few nearly
complete teeth showing a labiolingually compressed crown and serrated
mesial and distal carinae can be assigned to a small, indeterminate
theropod."&nbsp; The figured tooth (MNHN GEA 2-5) was placed in
Lasseron's
(2020) 'Theropoda gen. et sp. indet. morphotype I' in that work, which
is listed under Coelurosauria indet. here.&nbsp; No other theropod
teeth from GEA 2 were mentioned by Lasseron, meaning the others were
probably fragments among the 46 additional dental specimens catalogd
by Lasseron.&nbsp; The FSAC Theropoda
gen. et sp. indet. morphotype III and Coelurosauria gen. et sp. indet.
morphotype II of Lasseron have both mesial and distal serrations<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Excavated in 1941, these were made a syntype of Lapparent's (1955) new  theropod species <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus mersensis</span>,
along with a partial vertebral column now considered a teleosauroid
(Chabli, 1986) and a dorsal vertebra supposedly similar to the latter
specimen and so also placed in Teleosauroidea here.&nbsp; Unfortunately
the teeth were not illustrated and were only described as "three teeth,
unfortunately very incomplete. Their flattened form, in the slightly
arched blade of a saber, makes them belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span>. The enamel is ornamented with fine, regular longitudinal striations, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus bucklandi</span>,
but the serrations on the edges are not visible. Their size does not
exceed 5 cm in length."&nbsp; The teeth are here provisionally retained
as Averostra indet., as teleosaurid teeth are at best slightly
compressed labiolingually and Lapparent describes teleosaurid teeth in
the same publication (as the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Steneosaurus</span>
from El Mers") so would be expected to know the difference (although he
didn't for the vertebrae, so this opinion is not made
confidently).&nbsp; As Lapparent compared the fine longitudinal

they are unlikely to be strong enough to be fluting, and this leaves us
with no data to distinguish them from e.g. Jurassic ceratosaurs,
megalosauroids or carnosaurs.&nbsp; Note Lapparent's "List of principal
vertebrate localities in the Jurassic of El Mers" gives the number of
teeth as two, and while they were found two years after the vertebral
column, his statement "The presence of theropod carnivores at El Mers
was revealed to us initially by three teeth" could easily mean the
vertebrae were not (incorrectly) recognized as theropod until after the
teeth were discovered.&nbsp; The specimen numbers are assumed to be

first mentioned by Evans and Sigogneau-Russell (1997) as "small ...
theropod dinosaurs", Sigogneau-Russell et al. (1998) noted "We have
been able to distinguish 11 dinosauromorph tooth varieties (8
theropod") based on very small teeth (FABL 1-3 mm)" which were later
described in detail by Knoll and Ruiz-Omenaca (2009).&nbsp; The MNHN
specimens are referred to Theropoda indet. by Knoll and
Ruiz-Omenaca (2009) and are mostly fragments that could not be
evaluated for their tooth morphotypes, except MNHN SA 2004/5C which is
the second largest tooth in the sample (preserved length 11 mm) and has
a low DSDI (.77-.91) unlike their other morphotypes which lack mesial
serrations or have a high DSDI.&nbsp; The FSAC Theropoda gen. et sp.
indet. morphotype III of Lasseron has both mesial and distal
serrations, as do the Coelurosauria gen. et sp. indet. morphotypes II
and III.&nbsp; Lasseron et al. lists all four teeth under FSAC-KM-B'-26 as Dromaeosauridae.&nbsp; <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- Lavocat (1954) mentioned a coelurosaur (sensu Huene) tibia which "looks very much like the tibia of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus bambergi</span>" and "also resembles very much the two tibiae figured by STROMER (1934, pl. III, fig. 1, 2) as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>.
The relative orientation of the proximal and distal extremities is
exactly the same as in the figure 1 b of STROMER. Certain detailed
differences, notably in the development of the proximal antero-external
crest, permit one to think that pertains to a distinct species."&nbsp;
As Stromer's tibiae (IPHG 1912 VIII 76 and 1912 VIII 192) have since
been referred to Tetanurae, the placement of Lavocat's tibia in more
generalized Averostra is uncertain, although the similar size and
stratigraphic
placement could suggest it is closely related.<br>

Russell (1996) proposed multiple informal 'bone taxa' for isolated Kem
Kem theropod elements.&nbsp; Bone taxa G, I, J and M (in part) are here
referred to <i>Spinosaurus</i> 
  based on Ibrahim et al. (2014) for the first three and Chiarenza et al. (2016) 
  for the last, bone taxon F to a <i>Xuanhanosaurus</i>-like tetanurine, and bone 
  taxon H to a noasaurid. McFeeters (2013) could only identify CMN 50810 to Saurischia 
  incertae sedis, though he noted it was possibly a non-abelisauroid ceratosaur 
  if theropod (so maybe a juvenile <i>Deltadromeus</i>). Chiarenza and Cau referred 
  bone taxon C to Abelisauroidea based on similarity to Libyan abelisaur PRC.NF.1.21.<br>

recovered Morphotype 1 as a non-abelisaurian abelisauroid using
Hendrickx's theropod dental matrix, but noted this is poorly
supported.&nbsp; They further "refrain from referring Morphotype 1 to
as premaxillary teeth of a tetanuran, as the former does not display a
U-shaped cross-section nor a lingual migration of the anterior carina
as commonly observed in large tetanurans ... , and disparity in the
denticles density between the carinae."&nbsp; Thus perhaps these are
mesialmost dentary teeth of a more generic averostran outside
Megalosauria and Allosauroidea.&nbsp; Fanti et al. also noted three
teeth from the Elrhaz Formation (MNHN GRD553a, GRD553b and GAD600) have
this same morphotype.&nbsp; The authors referred Morphotype 7 to
Abelisauridae or Carcharodontosauridae, considering them "posterior
lateral teeth or possibly juvenile lateral teeth."<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- This material was mostly referred to Theropoda gen. et sp. 
  indet. by Stromer (1934), and is retained together as Averostra here for 
  the moment, although study of individual specimens will no doubt allow referral 
  to more precise clades. As with all of Stromer's Baharija material, the fossils 
  themselves were destroyed in 1944. <br>

  The pubis IPHG 1912 VIII 81 was referred to <i>Bahariasaurus</i> by Stromer 
  and stated to be "generally very similar to it", but differs several 
  ways. <i>Bahariasaurus</i> has a less conspicuous and more proximally placed 
  lateral flaring (15% down the shaft, compared to 21%). The distal end is not 
  flared laterally. There is an extensive separation of the pubic shafts distally, 
  and the interpubic foramen is more distally placed (80% down the shaft, vs. 
  71%). The proximally placed interpubic foramen suggests this is tetanurine, 
  while the absent obturator foramen is like spinosaurids, allosaurians and most 
  coelurosaurs. Sereno et al. (1996) referred it to <i>Deltadromeus</i>, but that 
  genus should have an interpubic foramen placed distally in the pubic boot itself 
  as in other ceratosaurs, making the referral unlikely. The specimens listed 
  under IPHG 1912 VIII 60, 69 and 70 were tentatively referred to <i>Bahariasaurus</i>. 
  IPHG 1912 VIII 60a-h is a series of caudals which Stromer wrote of as belonging 
  to a single individual. a is separated proximally, and g-h are located far more 
  distally. The centra are amphicoelous to amphiplatyan, g-h much broader than 
  tall, a-d have a ventral groove which is missing in g-h, and a-c have pleurocoels 
  but d-h do not. All vertebrae have neural spines, but g-h lack transverse processes. 
  Stromer wrote these were associated with the pectoral girdle, though he doesn't 
  state whether the skull fragment or larger centrum were associated more exactly 
  than being from the same layer. The scapula IPHG 1912 VIII 60 is missing most 
  of the acromion and the distal end, but was at least 7.6 times longer than the 
  minimum blade width. There is a slight midshaft expansion anteriorly, and the 
  glenoid faces completely ventrally. The associated coracoid is 84% as deep as 
  it is long, excluding the well developed posteroventral process that is missing 
  its distal end. No obvious coracoid tuber is present, nor is there a subglenoid 
  fossa. Stromer states the pectoral girdle IPHG 1912 VIII 77 is very similar 
  in size and shape, and shows the distal end of the scapula was unexpanded. He 
  declined to officially refer the material to a named species because the pectoral 
  girdle of <i>Spinosaurus</i> was unknown, and remains so today. Interestingly, 
  the coracoid is very similar to <i>Baryonyx</i>, differing only in the more 
  posteriorly positioned coracoid foramen and the lesser concavity below the glenoid. 
  The scapulae are also similar, though <i>Baryonyx</i>'s is expanded slightly 
  at the distal end and has a less projected glenoid region. Note that the caudals 
  are unlike spinosaurids' however, as the latter lack pleurocoels. Stromer tentatively 
  referred femur IPHG 1912 VIII 69 to <i>Bahariasaurus</i> based on differences 
  from <i>Spinosaurus</i> and <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i> and similarity in size 
  with referred <i>Bahariasaurus</i> specimen IPHG 1912 VIII 62 which was discovered 
  nearby. Fibula IPHG 1912 VIII 70 was referred to <i>Bahariasaurus</i> for the 
  same reasons, though note Stromer considered it to belong to a larger individual 
  than the femur although they were discovered in the same locality. The femur 
  was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Deltadromeus</span> by Sereno et al., which is followed here.&nbsp; The fibula's deep 
  proximomedial fossa indicates it is probably from a ceratosaur or avetheropod, 
  so it's possible they belong to the same taxon. Sereno et al. also referred the scapulocoracoid 
  IPHG 1912 VIII 60 and fibula IPHG 1912 VIII 70 discussed 
  above to <i>Deltadromeus</i>. The scapulocoracoid is more similar to <i>Baryonyx</i>, 
  but the fibula is rather similar to Deltadromeus and may belong to that genus. <br>

  IPHG 1912 VIII 78, 85 and 190 were referred to aff. <i>Erectopus sauvagei</i> 
  by Stromer, but none of the elements (distal femur, proximal and distal tibia) are especially similar to 
  <i>Erectopus</i>. They were all found in different deposits and may belong to 
  different taxa. Sereno et al. referred the proximal tibia to <i>Deltadromeus</i>, 
  and it is very similar to that genus so this may be correct.<br>

  Stromer misidentified IPHG 1912 VIII 82 as pubes, but the strong transverse 
  tapering distally, obturator process and lack of an interpubic foramen all resemble 
  ischia more. IPHG 1912 VIII 63 was identified as proximal femur, but resembles 
  a metatarsal more. Similarly, IPHG 1912 VIII 177 was identified as a humerus 
  but is a metatarsal II. <br>

  <b> Comments</b>- Gemmellaro (1921) referred several remains to <i>Megalosaurus crenatissimus</i>
(Abelisauridae indet. here) from three localities in eastern
Egypt.&nbsp; These included a smaller tooth illustrated as Figure 14,
said to be among
"some which, although sharing some common features, differ in the shape
of the crown which is not backward curved but is almost isosceles with
the sides having a profile slightly convex or straight."&nbsp; While
Gemmellaro believed "such differences in shape and in dimensions
between teeth has to be attributed to the diverse locations they
occupied in the jaws, and also to the different age of the individuals
whom the teeth belonged to", the mesiodistally narrower crown suggests
another taxon such as a noasaurid, and that tooth is listed as
Averostra
indet. here.&nbsp; The MGUP only has three teeth in their collection
now (Di Patti, pers. comm. 6-2023), none of which match Figure 14.<br>

<p><b>unnamed Averostra</b> (Janensch, 1925)<br>

  <b>Late Tithonian, Late Jurassic<br>
  Upper Dinosaur Member of the Tendaguru Formation, Tanzania</b><br>

  <b>Material</b>- (HMN MB R 1934; = MW 5) distal caudal centrum (119 mm)<br>

  (HMN MB R 1935; = MW 3) (~7.8 m) partial proximal caudal centrum<br>

  (HMN MB R 1940; = TL 45) proximal caudal vertebra (105 mm)<br>

  (HMN MB R 2160; = MW 2) incomplete quadrate (transverse condylar width 140 mm)<br>

  (HMN MB R lost; = EH 103) (adult) incomplete posterior dorsal vertebra (80 mm)<br>

  (HMN MB R lost; = St 297) cervical neural arch<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- MB R 1934, 1935 and 2160 were syntypes of <i>Ceratosaurus roechlingi</i> 
  (Janensch, 1925), but the latter is too large to belong to the lectotype individual 
  and none of the specimens is diagnostic beyond Theropoda (Rauhut, 2011). 
  Rauhut noted the caudal MB R 1940 shows similiarities to his new carcharodontosaurid 
  <i>Veterupristisaurus</i>, but it derives from higher sediments than that genus.

  Material</b>- (University of Zimbabwe coll.) tooth (~37x~20x? mm)<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Bond and Bromley
(1970) were the first to figure three theropod teeth, discovered
between 1962
and 1970, as their Plate 1A "Reptilian teeth of two types from the
Gokwe Formation." Listed as being " in collection of Geology
Department, University College of Rhodesia", the latter has since been
renamed the University of Zimbabwe.&nbsp; The first and third are
clearly
abelisaurid, but the second is narrower and more recurved, so referred
to Averostra
indet. here.&nbsp; Fine serrations are present at least distally (~7
per 5 mm), which are not as tall as in the abelisaurid teeth.<br>

  Enon Conglomerate, South Africa</b><br>

  <b>Material</b>- (SAM 643) tooth (28 mm)<br>

  (SAM 649) tooth (&gt;32 mm)<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- These teeth lack mesial serrations, and have 18-20 serrations 
  per 5 mm on the distal carina. As no other details are available besides general 
  shape in lateral view and absence of vertical striations (unlike some ceratosaurids), 
  it is unlikely these teeth can be classified more precisely based on published 
  data. <br>

  <b>Material</b>- (SAM K1475) pedal ungual (94 mm)<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- Mateer (1987) referred this ungual to either Megalosauridae 
  or Allosauridae, while Nessov (1995) referred it to Therizinosauria or "groups 
  most closely related to them" (which in his opinion consisted of spinosaurids 
  and dryptosaurids). Neither of these opinions was made in the context of a modern 
  understanding of theropod phylogeny however. Provisional comparisons suggest 
  it more closely resembles pedal unguals of <i>Sinraptor</i> and <i>Poekilopleuron</i> 
  than those of any therizinosaurs (<i>Beipiaosaurus</i>, <i>Alxasaurus</i>, <i>Nothronychus</i>, 
  <i>Erlikosaurus</i>), which tend to be deeper and more curved. <br>

<p></p><p><b>unnamed possible averostran</b> (Huene, 1934)<br>

  <b>Barremian-Santonian, Early Cretaceous-Late Cretaceous<br>
  Guichon Formation, Uruguay<br>
  Material</b>- (CA coll.; tooth B; lost) premaxillary tooth (9.3x5.2x3.3 mm)<br>

  <b>Comments</b>- The tooth is similar to tyrannosaurid premaxillary
teeth in being narrow and D-shaped with both carinae on the lingual
edge, with at loeast one carina having 4.5 serrations per mm.&nbsp; The
surface between carinae is deeply concave.<br>
Huene (1934) identified this tooth as an ornithomimid, but contra Soto et al. (2011) was unjustified in doing so by then as <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span> had a described edentulous skull as of 1916 even ignoring <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromiceiomimus samueli</span>
in 1928.&nbsp; Huene's identification was based on a tooth described by Lambe (1902) provisionally as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus altus</span>
(CMN coll.; plate XIV figure 12-13), but which can now be identified as
an albertosaurine premaxillary tooth.&nbsp; Soto et al. suggested Mones
(1997) might have tentatively
identified this tooth as a sebecosuchian and also noted Soto and
Cambiaso (2006) reidentified the element as Theropoda indet..&nbsp;
Ford (online
2015) placed it in Troodontidae without comment.&nbsp; Huene states the
tooth was discovered by Aznarez with the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Uruguaysuchus</span>,
which is in the private Coleccin Aznrez according to Soto et al.
(2011) , who also state the teeth described by Huene are lost.<br>

  Plottier Formation of the Rio Neuquen Group, Neuquen, Argentina<br>
  Material-</b> (MLP coll.) incomplete tooth (16 x 9.5 x 6.3 mm)<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- <i>Carnosaurus</i> was listed by Huene (1929) in a faunal list 
  for three specimens- a metapodial (MLP CS 1240) from the Allen Formation, a 
  tooth (MACN coll.) perhaps from the Chubut group, and provisionally ("Cf. 
  <i>Carnosaurus</i>") a tooth (MLP coll.) from the Plottier Formation. As 
  Olshevsky (DML, 1999) noted, the name is probably a typographical error for 
  Carnosauria made when translating the paper from German to Spanish. This is 
  indicated by the fact he never attaches a name to these specimens in the description 
  or plates, and indeed states on of the specimens is taxonomically indistinguishable 
  from another named genus. Since "Carnosaurus" was apparently not meant 
  as a valid name when it was published (ICZN Article 11.5), it is a nomen nudum.<br>
  Huene described the Plottier tooth under the heading "tooth of a carnivorous 
  saurischian", stating it was not his intention to decide whether it was 
  a coelurosaur or carnosaur. The mesial edge is more convex than the distal edge, 
  especially basally. There are 12.5 serrations per 5 mm, stated to be on both 
  mesial and distal carinae. The tooth seems to be from a somewhat anterior position, 
  as it has an asymmetrical section, with one side generally more convex except 
  for a distally placed concavity. What are described as growth lines on the labial 
  and lingual surfaces may be enamel wrinkles, which are apically concave in the 
  distal half of one side. This tooth is difficult to place without further study 
  of Gondwanan small theropod dentitions and is here assigned to Averostra. <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- NMV P199085 is probably the ungual mentioned by Pigdon (online

  (2012) described it as weakly curved with a low flexor tubercle and flattened 
  ventral surface which is broader than the dorsal surface. The authors referred 
  it to Theropoda indet., and there is no evidence it belonged to <i>Timimus</i>. 
  <br>

  Rich (2003) reported identifying small theropod skull fragments, but Benson 
  et al. (2012) state the only cranial element known is an unidentified frontal. 
  Cleeland (2004) reported NMV P186175 and P186218, though neither are mentioned

  <b>Comments</b>- Though NMV P186386 was identified as an oviraptorosaur by Currie 
  et al. (1996) based on its medially projecting coronoid process, Agnolin et 
  al. (2010) noted the convex margin with no obvious external mandibular fenestra 
  and lack of articular fusion differed from that clade.<br>
