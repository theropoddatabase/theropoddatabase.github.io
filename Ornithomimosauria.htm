<b>Comments</b>- Holtz (1992) originally used Arctometatarsalia in his
thesis before officially naming it for the same clade in 1994
(tyrannosaurids, ornithomimosaurs, troodontids, caenagnathids and <i>Avimimus</i>).
These all share an arctometatarsus, with the third metatarsal pinched
proximally, but tyrannosaurids, derived ornithomimosaurs, caenagnathids
(including <i>Avimimus</i>) and derived troodontids are now known to
have developed the structure in parallel. Holtz and Padian (1995) later
defined the clade as "all coelurosaurs closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span> than to birds", so
while the original content and diagnostic feature no longer apply, the
name can still be used. <br>
Sereno (2017) erected Ornithomimiformes to replace Arctometatarsalia. I
actually think it's a better name for the clade in question, especially
as the arctometatarsus evolved so many times and most authors would
only include ornithomimosaurs in the taxon anyway. Also,
Arctometatarsalia was originally defined as an apomorphy-based clade,
and arctometatarsalian is a non-taxonomic word as well. The problem is
priority, as Arctometatarsalia has over two decades of it both
nomenclaturally and definitionally.<br>

of lateral quadrate condyle; manual phalanx II-1 less than twice as
long as phalanx III-1.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Sereno's (2017) definition revises his earlier (1998)
one which only included <i>Passer</i> as an external specifier, and Osmólska's (1997) which only included <i>Troodon</i>. Hu et al.'s
(2009) recent definition functions for the present phylogeny and if
alvarezsaurids are found to be maniraptorans. The only other suggested
definition is Makovicky et al.'s (2004), which is a node-based first
level redefinition of Padian et al.'s (1999) using <i>Pelecanimimus</i>
and <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</i>. Sereno has a good point that a
taxon directly outside <i>Pelecanimimus</i> + <i>Ornithomimus</i>
(such as <i>Deinocheirus</i> in Makovicky et al. 2004) should be an
ornithomimosaur, but wouldn't be using the node-based definition.
Furthermore, <i>Pelecanimimus</i> is an alvarezsauroid in Hartman et
al. (2019), which would force alvarezsaurids inside Ornithomimosauria.
Hu et al.'s and Sereno's definitions are both problematic due to the
use of <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</i> instead of <i>O. velox</i>.
See the comments under Maniraptoriformes for details.  Hartman et
al. (2019) solved these problems with sufficient external specifiers
and use of the type species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>.<br>
<b>Ex-ornithomimosaurs</b>- Russell (1935) referred a pedal phalanx
(CMN coll.) from the Milk River Formation of Alberta, Canada to
Ornithomimidae, but McFeeters et al. (2014) found it resembles
thescelosaurids and (McFeeters pers. comm. 2014) <i>Elmisaurus</i>
more. <br>
Gallup (1975) referred a femur (FMNH PR 975), pedal phalanx IV-3 and
ungual ?IV (FMNH Turtle Gully) to <i>Ornithomimus</i> sp., but these
may be another kind of coelurosaur. <br>
Horner (1979) listed metatarsals YPM VPPU.021795 as Ornithomimidae
indet., and Baird (1986) mentioned it and caudal YPM PU 22416 as
ornithimimids, both from the Merchantville Formation of Delaware, but
these have since been reidentified as tyrannosauroid (e.g. Brownstein,
2017).<br>
Currie et al. (2008) stated ornithomimid elements were present in the
Nemegt <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
bonebed, but the final description by Funston et al. (2016) doesn't
include these in the 17 non-Avimimus specimens, suggesting these were
downgraded to Dinosauria indet..<br>
Alifanov and Saveliev (2015) described a supposed new taxon of
ornithomimosaur, <i>Lepidocheirosaurus</i>, which is based on <i>Kulindadromeus</i>
specimens (see entry for the latter genus). <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Collected between October and December 1887, Marsh (1888) originally
referred hindlimb and pedal elements to his new species <i>Allosaurus
medius</i>, including USNM 5453 and 5652 as syntypes. Lull (1911)
retained a tooth (USNM 4972) as the lectotype of <i>Allosaurus medius</i>,
but noted "the "first phalanx of the hind foot [USNM 5453]," surely,
and the astragalus [USNM 5652], probably, may be relegated to the
ornithopod dinosaurs of the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryosaurus</span>,
and, together with other material, become the cotypes of a new
species."  This other material consisted of- USNM 5684, 5703
(mistyped
as 5684 in his list), 5704, 6107 (then unnumbered) and 8456 (then
Goucher College 2609), making these all syntypes of his new species <i>Dryosaurus
grandis</i>.
He also described USNM 6108 as belonging to the taxon. Whether all of
these remains were originally associated is unknown (except USNM 8456
which was found in a different locality in 1884), though they are of
the right size
to be. USNM 5453 and 6108 are both left pedal phalanges II-1, so
indicate at least three individuals are present in the syntype
material.  To prevent a possible chimaera a lectotype should be
chosen,
for which I suggest USNM 5453 as it was the specimen assigned to <i>Dryosaurus
grandis</i>
most definitively by Lull (and incorrectly listed on The Paleobiology
Database as the holotype).  Gilmore realized the material was
coelurosaurian, assigning them to Ornithomimidae in a short note
(Gilmore, 1919) and making the <span style="font-style: italic;">grandis</span>
syntypes and USNM 6108 syntypes of his new species <i>Ornithomimus
affinis</i> (since the combination <i>Ornithomimus grandis</i> already
existed) in an in depth description (Gilmore, 1920). While the species
name <i>affinis</i> has been used by everyone since, <i>grandis</i>
has priority when not paired with <i>Ornithomimus</i>
since it was named nine years earlier. It is not a nomen oblitum, as it
was used as a valid name after 1899 (ICZN Article 23.9.1.1). If it is
to be conserved, it must be referred to the ICZN for a ruling under the
plenary power (Article 23.9.3). Gilmore referred four more specimens to
his species, USNM 5701, 6115, 6116 and 8454, of which distal caudals
5701 and 6116 (then unnumbered) were referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus medius</span> by Lull and
vertebral centrum 8454 was referred to the ankylosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Priconodon</span>.
The latter specimen is here tentatively placed in Ornithischia. 
USNM 8456 was identified as phalanx IV-2 by Gilmore, but is more likely
IV-3 based on its proportions.  Note all of this material besides
USNM 8456 was collected between October 1887 and January 1888. 
Matthew and Brown (1922) referred <i>affinis</i> to <i>"Coelosaurus"</i>
(which they thought could be congeneric itself with <i>Ornithomimus</i>)
based on geography and incorrectly thinking <i>"Coelosaurus" antiquus</i>
lived earlier than <i>Ornithomimus</i> and <i>Struthiomimus</i>.
Russell (1972) referred the species to <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> based
on curved pedal ungual USNM 6107, and Paul (1988) went along by placing
it in <i>Ornithomimus</i> but the subgenus <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>.
Notably both Gilmore and Paul had concepts of <i>Ornithomimus</i>
equivalent to Ornithomimidae as used today. Smith and Galton (1990)
suggested "the pedal unguals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus
asiaticus</span> are straight as in other ornithomimids, and the
recurved Asian phalanges are probably referable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>" and that USNM 6107
"is probably from the theropod<span style="font-style: italic;">
Dryptosaurus</span> (?) [= <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus?
medius</span>]
that is also described from there."  However, more recent
discoveries
show some ornithomimosaurs did have curved pedal unguals, and both
Arundel and <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
material (e.g. AMNH 6570- pers. obs.) include examples of each
morphology.  Smith and Galton further stated that "the Arundel
material, except for the two partial metatarsals [USNM 5684 and 5704],
is insufficient to characterize beyond theropod incertae sedis" and
that "the two metatarsals ... can only be referred to a coelurosaurian
grade."  Almost none of the historic Arundel dinosaur specimens of
Marsh, Lull
and Gilmore had recorded locality data, with most sources simply saying
"Near Muirkirk" (Lull, 1911; Gilmore, 1920).  Hatcher (1903)
specified "The exact locality of the Marsh material was certain iron
ore mines on the farm of Mr. William Coffin, and especially in that one
locally known as “Swampoodle” and situated about 1 1/2 miles northeast
of Beltsville, on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railway, some 13 miles from
Washington."  As shown in Kranz's (1996) Figure 9, the Muirkirk
Iron
Works owned by Coffin were about 2.2 miles from the Swampoodle site, so
this description isn't really that specific and USNM Locality 41615
(where most of the syntypes, and USNM 6115 and 6116 are catalogd as
from) probably refers to at least this large area.  As Kranz
states, "Virtually all of the modern discoveries have come from" "the
brick clay pit of Cherokee Sanford Co. south of Contee Road and east of
U.S. 1, Muirkirk" (now Dinosaur Park), which is listed as USNM Locality
41614 in modern literature.  Note the USNM online catalog doesn't
use USNM 41614, assigning all specimens to USNM 41615 instead and
Carrano (pers. comm. 7-2024) has confirmed that in the catalog "for
the moment the two numbers are effectively equivalent."  <br>

Gilmore (1920) referred "The median portion of a very large ungual (No.
8505 U.S.N.M.) collected by Arthur Bibbins from the Arundel formation
near Contee, Maryland" to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus
potens</span>
"on account of its great size".  He stated "its slightly curved
contours with lateral longitudinal grooves indicate the terminal
phalanx of digit I of the fore foot", but it is far too straight for a
carnosaur or tyrannosauroid, instead being similar to manual unguals II
and III of "Grusimimus" in side outline based on the USNM online
catalog.  Thus it is here provisionally assigned to
Ornithomimosauria, and would be ~233 mm if scaled to "Grusimimus"
proportions and lead to an estimated femoral length of ~1.01 m. 
Further study on the specimen itself should be done before considering
it to be evidence of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>-sized
ornithomimosaurs in the Arundel.  It was discovered in 1894 and is
marked as W.C.B 2540, probably a Goucher College number based on its
closeness to other Arundel specimen numbers.<br>

Brownstein (2016 online) redescribed the <span style="font-style: italic;">affinis</span>
material as "Ornithomimosauria gen. et. sp. indet." and added
astragalus USNM 540727 found in 2010 and provisionally pedal phalanx
USNM 16748 discovered on May 23, 1943.  The latter was previously
figured by Martin and Brett-Surman (1992 unpublished; Figure 11) as
"Theropod phalanx".  While both Martin and Brett-Surman's and the
USNM's online catalog photos lack a scale, Brownstein notes it is "is
similar in size" to USNM 8456.  Note Brownstein incorrectly lists
USNM 540727 as USNM 5407
in all but one instance.  The latter number is a radius of the
brontothere <span style="font-style: italic;">Menodus</span> from the
Eocene Chadron Formation of South Dakota.<br>

Brownstein (2017) described several new specimens as ornithomimosaurs,
suggesting "NHRD-AP 2014.s.197, NHRD-AP 2014.s.198, and USNM V 6107
share similarities with basal ornithomimosaurs in being recurved and
blunt", while "NHRD-AP 2014.s.195 and USNM PAL 529423 are more similar
to the unguals of derived ornithomimosaurs and ornithomimids in being
flattened, having a prominent ridge of bone oriented proximodistally in
dorsal view, having depressions directly proximal to the proximal end
of their grooves for the claw sheath, and being elongate."  USNM
529423 is a cast of an ungual found in 2005, while NHRD-AP specimens
are generally from the year in their number or the year prior to that
so range from 2013-2016.  <br>

An unpublished specimen is caudal vertebra USNM 544052, identified as
an ornithomimid by Carrano and discovered between 2010 and 2013. 
USNM 487095 from 1994 is only identified in the online USNM catalog as
a proximal metatarsal IV from Saurischia indet., but is provisionally
placed in Ornithomimosauria here based on the posteriorly raised
hypotarsal platform common in that group.  USNM 529422 from 2005
is listed on the USNM online catalog as Saurischia indet. pedal phalanx
IV-2, but is so shortened it most resembles IV-3 of ornithomimosaurs so
is provisionally placed in that group here.  USNM 534106 from 1999
is in the USNM online catalog as "distal end of
metapodial" of Saurischia indet., but the smoothly concave distal end
(in extensor view) and large extensor pit match pedal phalanges III-1
and III-2 of theropods best, particularly ornithomimosaurs like
"Grusimimus".  The less dorsally angled sides of the articular end
suggest III-1 instead of III-2, and proportions like "Grusimimus" might
suggest a length of ~89 mm, comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">grandis</span> syntypes.  Thus it is
provisionally referred to that taxon here.<br>

Given the increasing knowledge of basal coelurosaurs and assignment of
some like <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span> and
perhaps <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span> to
Ornithomimosauria, a restudy of the Arundel material is
necessary.  Its listing under <span style="font-style: italic;">grandis</span>
here is merely for convenience in lieu of a lectotype as more than one
taxon could easily be represented.  Weishampel and Young (1996)
wrote "the top
of a
left tibia (fig. 7.7) and a number of toe bones (including one of the
claws) - probably came from an animal 3 to 4 meters (10 to 13 feet)
long" and proposed "Among theropods, the only ones that have flat claws
on the feet and a tibia that has a large crest sticking out the front
are ornithomimosaurs. These are the same features found in the new
Arundel theropod and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus
affinis</span>, so it is reasonable to
conclude that they too are ornithomimosaurs."  They concluded the
specimen "perhaps should be called <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ornithomimus"
affinis</span>."  However, the specimen (USNM 466054) was later
determined by Carrano (2024) to be" the first Arundel material
that can be confidently identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>."<br>

<b>Barremian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Lower Member of the Sebayashi Formation, Japan<br>
Material</b>- (GMNH-PV-028; Sanchu-ryu) (~7 m) first or second sacral
centrum (110 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1981 or 1982, and
reported as a caudal centrum nearly identical to <i>Gallimimus</i> by
Hasegawa et al. (1984). They nicknamed the specimen Sanchu-ryu, which
was inappropriately made into the nomen nudum "Sanchusaurus" by Hisa
(1985) in an illustrated Japanese booklet. Hasegawa et al. (1999) later
described the centrum in detail as a thirteenth dorsal vertebra, based
on comparison to <i>Gallimimus</i>. Yet the thirteenth dorsal vertebra
as identified by Osmólska et al. (1987) is recognized as the first
sacral vertebra by most modern workers, making "Sanchusaurus"' vertebra
a sacral instead. The lateral fossae indicate this is an
ornithomimosaur, as only they and <i>Avimimus</i> are known to have
the feature among non-avian theropods. <i>Avimimus</i> differs in
having either convex or concave ventral surfaces on its anterior
sacrals. Though stated by Hasegawa et al. (1984, 1999) as being nearly
identical to <i>Gallimimus</i>' first sacral, several differences are
apparent. The anterior width is ~107% of its height, compared with ~80%
in <i>Gallimimus</i>. "Sanchusaurus"' centrum is deeply amphicoelous,
while <i>Gallimimus</i>' is slightly amphiplatyan. Finally, the
centrum of "Sanchusaurus" seems more markedly constricted ventrally
than <i>Gallimimus</i>'. According to Makovicky's description of <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>,
it resembles a second sacral centrum more in having a lateral fossa,
wider dimensions and ventral flattening. <i>Shenzhousaurus</i>' first
sacral centrum (homologous to the second in <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>)
has a highly constricted ventral edge as in "Sanchusaurus". It is not a
posterior sacral, as it lacks a ventral sulcus. Thus "Sanchusaurus"
seems to be represented by a centrum homologous to the ancestral
neotheropod first sacral centrum and the ornithomimid second sacral
centrum. It is indeterminate within Ornithomimosauria.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Britt et al. (2004) listed three individuals as
Ornithomimosauria indet.. <br>
Scheetz et al. (2010) commented on a new ornithomimosaur-like taxon
represented by one individual. This has a large orbit, a large number
of small dentary teeth with constricted roots, camellate cervicals with
elongate (2.3 times longer than tall) slightly amphicoelous centra and
low elongate neural spines, strongly posteriorly angled proximal caudal
transverse processes, distal caudals with centra wider than tall and
prezygapophyses nearly 50% of central length, skid-like distal
chevrons, a broad scapula, straight humerus, radiohumeral ratio of 75%,
large supracetabular crest, fibula-calcaneum articulation, moderately
tall ascending process, metatarsotibial ratio of 60% and
non-arctometatarsalian metatarsus. While their phylogenetic analysis
found it to be a basal coelurosaur convergent with ornithomimosaurs, it
is listed here pending the description given the other supposed Yellow
Mountain ornithomimosaurs and taxa like <i>Nqwebasaurus</i>
that have varied in position between those alternatives.  Hunt and
Quinn (2018) cite Scheetz et al.'s (2010) specimen as BYU 19114, an
adult supposedly similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span>
and currently being prepared (Britt pers. comm. 2016 to Hunt and
Quinn).  They provide metatarsal lengths.<br>
Turner et al. (2012) noted a postorbital tentatively referred to
Ornithomimidae, and a cervical claimed to be ornithomimid-like due to
its elongation and strongly opisthocoelous centrum. As ornithomimosaurs
have amphicoelous to amphiplatyan cervicals, this latter claim is
confusing. Turner et al. also propose the possible <i>Utahraptor</i>
ischium BYU 10978 may be ornithomimid based on the proximally placed
obturator process, lack of a lateral ridge, rodlike shaft and
semicircular proximolateral scar.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Ostrom (1970) referred these to <i>Ornithomimus sp.</i>
based on being supposedly virtually indistinguishable from <i>O. velox</i>,
though he did note the ungual was not identical to ornithomimids'.
However, Holtz (1992) noted the metatarsals were more robust than
ornithomimids', that there are no facets or buttresses for a
wedge-shaped metatarsal III, and that metatarsal II resembled <i>Allosaurus</i>
and <i>Ornitholestes</i> posteriorly more than it does ornithomimids.
Indeed, judging by Ostrom's figure, metatarsal II differs from <i>Ornithomimus</i>
in having a less ventrally oriented medial condyle and more proximally
placed ventral convexity, while metatarsal IV lacks the marked
posterior buttress and has more transversely expanded condyles. The
pedal ungual has a more developed posterodorsal process, more obvious
side grooves, and less developed side flanges. It resembles <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
in these characters except for the side flange development. Even basal
ornithomimosaurs like <i>Harpymimus</i>, <i>Garudimimus</i> and <i>Beishanlong</i>
seem more like ornithomimids in having distally placed ventral
convexity on metatarsal II and less expanded distal condyles on
metatarsal IV, so the metatarsals may be from a taxon like <i>Nedcolbertia</i>,
<i>Microvenator</i> or another coelurosaur. The ungual does resemble
those of ornithomimids, but not those of basal ornithomimosaurs. The
specimens did not belong to the same individuals, and may be from
different taxa as well.  Hunt and Quinn (2018) state these
specimens "have more similarities to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus
velox</span> than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Arkansaurus</span> and will be
discussed in greater detail in the future (Hunt-Foster and Kirkland, in

Ostrom (1970) lists "?<span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>
sp. (AMNH uncatalogd)" from two sites in Big Horn County, Montana,
stating "no precise location can be given" and that "Brown simply
recorded it as "Beauvais Creek"."  The AMNH online database has
two entries for Saurischia (AMNH 811, 21556) from Beauvais Creek, at
least the former collected by Brown.  These are tentatively
accepted as Ostrom's then uncatalogd specimens, one of which is
listed by him as "fragment of a proximal pedal phalanx."<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Reports of ornithomimosaur vertebrae from Early
Cretaceous Victoria began with Rich and Vickers-Rich (1994) mentioning
"a number of vertebrae" in their description of <i>Timimus</i> as a
member of that clade. Currie et al. (1996) also mention ornithomimosaur
vertebrae from the Otway and Strzelecki Groups. While at least sixteen
vertebrae are known from these groups, only one was considered by
Benson et al. (2012) to be similar to ornithomimosaurs- NMV P186168, a
proximal caudal. The elongate centrum, proplatyan articular ends and
anteroposteriorly elongate transverse process were considered
ornithomimosaur-like. Novas et al. (2013) argued these characters were
also present in ceratosaurs, questioning Benson et al.'s
identification. Which additional vertebrae earlier authors had in mind
as ornithomimosaurian is unknown. <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in 1972, this pes was known through abstracts and the
popular literature until being described and illustrated in detail by
Hunt (2003).  For instance, Pittman (1989) wrote "A foot of an
ornithomimid, not yet described, was recovered from Lower Cretaceous
sandstone in Arkansas (Dan Chure pers. comm.)."  Hunt and Quinn
(2018) finally named the taxon officially
and published an additional description.  A partial dorsal
vertebra,
caudal vertebra, scapular fragment and femoral fragment are also known
from the Trinity Group, but were not associated with the specimen.<br>
Quinn (1973) states their new taxon is most closely related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>, while Hunt (2003)
proposes a coelurosaur identification perhaps closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span>.

<b>Holotype</b>- (CEUM 5071) (1.5 m; juvenile) fifth sacral vertebra
(~26 mm), eleven partial or complete caudal vertebrae, distal humerus,
partial pubis, ischial fragments, proximal femora, distal femur (~141
mm), tibiae (198 mm), proximal fibula, distal fibulae, partial
astragali, calcanea, metatarsal II (~108 mm), metatarsal III (~116 mm),

<b>Comments</b>- This was originally announced in an abstract by
Kirkland et al. (1995), then mentioned in a 1996 news report as
"Nedcolbertia whittlei". Kirkland (1996) listed it as "small
coelurosaurid cf. <i>Ornitholestes</i> n. gen." in an abstract. The
species name was changed to "justinhofmanni" in January 1998 due to 6
year old Justin Hofmann winning a contest sponsored by Discover Card.
It wasn't officially named <i>N. justinhofmanni</i> until October of
that year (Kirkland et al., 1998). Brusatte (2013) notes <i>Nedcolbertia</i>
is under study by himself and that a redescription is going to be
published.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span> was initially
described as a "basal coelurosaur near <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>" and was recovered as
a coelurosaur outside Tyrannoraptora by Holtz et al. (2004) and Dal
Sasso and Maganuco (2011).  More recently, Brownstein (2017) found
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span>
shares several synapomorphies with ornithomimosaurs and ornithomimids
in having anteroposteriorly shortened phalanges from pedal digit IV,
the ventral surfaces of the pedal ungual flattened in lateral view,
being triangular in proximal view, having ventrolateral and
ventromedial edges developed into keels, and having a flexor fossa on
the proximal end of the ventral surface of its pedal unguals", and Hunt
and Quinn (2018) stated "upon reexamination of the material for this
study, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Nedcolbertia</span>
specimens are definitively basal ornithomimosaurs, possessing the
trademark subarctometatarsalian condition, as well as other basal
ornithomimosaur synapomorphies (Hunt-Foster and Kirkland, in prep)."<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Kielan-Jaworowska and Dovchin (1968) report the holotype was found on
June 9 1965- "Kielan-Jaworowska found at Altan Via III complete
forelimbs and shoulder girdle of enormous size (limbs 2.5 m long) of an
unknown carnivorous dinosaur, belonging evidently to a new family of
theropod dinosaurs."  On an earlier version of ZPAL's website,
MgD-I/64 was listed as <i>Deinocheirus sp.</i>. Now it is listed as
Theropoda
indet..  The <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>

from the Nemegt Formation and is ~700 mm long, estimated at </span></span></span>~720
mm when complete.  Under their discussion of Altan Uul III, Watabe
et al.
(2010) state "the JMJPE found additional isolated bones of digits of
forelimbs of the animal."  Ryan (online 2008) notes he and Currie
relocated the holotype quarry and collected more of the skeleton,
though this remains undescribed. Kielan-Jaworowska (1966) originally
identified the holotype as Megalosauridae indet. before it was named
and described by Osmólska and Roniewicz (1970) as a megalosauroid
carnosaur. The supposed hyoids described by Osmólska and Roniewicz
resemble the sternal processes of <i>Struthiomimus</i> more, so are
reidentified as such here. 
In an addendum to Palaeontologica Polonica volume 21, it is stated "due
to a new agreement between the Palaeozoological Institute of the Polish
Academy of Sciences and the Geological Institute of the Academy of
Sciences of the Mongolian People's Republic, two of the specimens,
described in the present volume, as housed in the Palaeozoological
Institute in Warsaw, are now housed in the Geological Institute in UIan
Bator", with one being the <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>
holotype.<br>
While only known from the holotype forelimbs and axial fragments for
decades, Lee et al. (2013) reported two new partial skeletons found in
2006 and 2009. The skull and pes of IGM 100/127 had been previously
collected (after 2002) and privately owned until acquired and donated
to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, then repatriated to
the Central Dinosaur Museum in 2014. <br>
Kobayashi and Barsbold (2006) and Senter (2007) both found the holotype
to be a basal ornithomimosaur when added to versions of the TWG matrix,
which is similar to what Makovicky et al. (2004) suggested without
including it in their analysis. Lee et al. (2014) included <i>Deinocheirus</i>
in Choiniere's <i>Nqwebasaurus</i> analysis based on the new specimens
and found it to be an ornithomimosaur most closely related to <i>Garudimimus</i>
and <i>Beishanlong</i>,
so more derived than other recent proposals.  However, Hartman et
al. (2019) recovered it in its standard basal position, requiring 14
steps to move to Garudimimidae.  Only 4 steps move it in a clade
with other toothless ornithomimosaurs however.  <br>

<b>Early Aptian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Lujiatun Beds of Yixian Formation, Liaoning, China</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (JLUM-JZ07b1) (adult) skull (136 mm), mandible (115
mm), five cervical vertebrae (one partial), scapulocoracoids (scapula
~104 mm), humerus (~90 mm), radius (~76 mm), ulna (81 mm), phalanx I-1
(33 mm), manual ungual I (22 mm), metacarpal II, phalanx II-1 (25 mm),
phalanx II-2 (26 mm), manual ungual II (23 mm), metacarpal III, phalanx
III-1 (23 mm), phalanx III-2 (24 mm), manual ungual III (18 mm), femur
(135 mm), tibiofibulotarsus, metatarsal I, phalanx I-1 (23 mm), pedal
ungual I (21 mm), metatarsal II (86 mm), phalanx II-1 (22 mm), phalanx
II-2 (18 mm), pedal ungual II (20 mm), metatarsal III (84 mm), phalanx
III-1 (18 mm), phalanx III-2 (16 mm), phalanx III-3 (15 mm), pedal
ungual III (16 mm), metatarsal IV (~79 mm), phalanx IV-1 (13.5 mm),
phalanx IV-2 (13 mm), phalanx IV-3 (12 mm), phalanx IV-4 (12 mm), pedal
ungual IV (16 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Jin et al., 2012) anterior portion of
premaxilla deflected ventrally in front of mandible, so that its oral
surface is level with the ventral border of dentary; sagittal crest on
parietal; pendant paroccipital processes that extend ventrally below
the level of the foramen magnum; fenestra on lateral surface of mid
dentary (taphonomic?); only three phalanges on manual digit III
(incorrectly listed as IV by Jin et al.); tibiotarsus/femur length
ratio &gt;137%.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Jin et al., the antorbital fossa does
not invade the entire lateral maxillary surface, and its depth is
unknown as the medial wall is eroded away. The low ratio between manual
phalanx II-2 and II-1 lengths may be plesiomorphic, shared with e.g. <i>Nqwebasaurus</i>
and the Tugriken Shireh parvicursorine. The elongate manual phalanx
III-1 may be due to the fusion of III-1 and III-2 or the loss of the
ancestral III-1. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen also includes parts which were added
prior to its scientific acquisition. Jin et al. found it to be in a
polytomy with <i>Shenzhousaurus</i>
and more derived ornithomimosaurs in their analysis.  Hartman et
al. (2019) were the first authors to analyze it in an analysis not
limited to ornithomimosaurs, and recovered it as a basalmost
ornithomimosaur sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Buffetaut et al. (2009) diagnosed <i>Kinnareemimus</i>
based on the combination of primitive (metatarsal III contacts tarsus
in extensor view) and derived (metatarsal III rod-like just distal to
proximal expansion; metatarsal III triangular distally) characters, but
these are present in all subarctometatarsal taxa (e.g. basal
troodontids, microraptorians). Their additional qualifier of <i>Kinareemimus</i>
being an ornithomimid with these characters has yet to be defended with
synapomorphies or analysis. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- A pedal phalanx (III-2?) is labeled PW5A-123 in figure
7 (of Buffetaut et al., 2009), but this is the number for the dorsal
centrum in other areas of the text. It is more likely PW5A-117, as this
is the only phalanx not otherwise present in the figure. Similarly, the
text mentions PW5A-113 as phalanx III-2, but it is otherwise mentioned
in the paper as a proximal pubis.<br>
Discovered
in 1995, this was first briefly described by Buffetaut et al. (1995) as
"fairly abundant remains of several individuals of a small theropod
dinosaur clearly referrable to the Ornithomimosauria", proposing it was
more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> based on
arctometatarsaly (which turned out to be absent), but less so than <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>
based on the short metatarsus.  Suteethorn et al. (1995) similarly
mention this as "a number of postcranial bones (vertebrae, tibiae,
metatarsals, phalanges) of a small ornithomimosaur."  Buffetaut
and Suteethorn (1998) briefly described and illustrated its metatarsus.
Kaneko (2000) referred to this taxon as "Ginnareemimus" in a popular
magazine article, but Olshevsky (DML, 2000) noted it would be spelled
differently once formally described. Sasidhorn and Suteethorn (2000)
meanwhile used the name "Kinareemimus" in a Thai article which was
unknown in the west until 2009. The final description appeared in 2009,
where the name was spelled <i>Kinnareemimus</i>.<br>
All Thai publications have interpreted this as an ornithomimosaur more
derived than <i>Garudimimus</i>, but less so than arctometatarsal
ornithomimids. However, no ornithomimosaur synapomorphies have ever
been listed. Buffetaut et al.'s (2009) stated resemblences are either
plesiomorphic (hollow caudal centra; cnemial crest continues distally
as ridge; proximomedial fibular groove; proximoflexor process on
metatarsal II) or vague ("general resemblence" of caudal vertebrae and
tibiae; phalanges II-1 and III-2 resembling "<i>Ornithomimus affinis</i>"
[=<i>"Dryosaurus" grandis</i>]; phalanx IV-3 resembling <i>Gallimimus</i>;
pedal ungual resembling <i>Struthiomimus</i>). The rod-like proximal
portion just distal to the proximal expansion, narrow proximal
exposure, and distally triangular section of metatarsal III are found
in other subarctometatarsal and arctometatarsal taxa too, not just
ornithomimids. Metatarsal III is proximally narrowed but still contacts
the tarsus on the extansor surface, as in subarctometatarsal taxa like <i>Microraptor</i>,
but unlike ornithomimosaurs, which seem to have evolved proximal
contact between metatarsals II and IV before metatarsal III was
narrowed (e.g. <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>). The described pedal ungual
spur is part of the articular surface, not a more distally placed spur
as in some ornithomimosaurs. <br>
Brusatte et al. (2014) included it in their TWG analysis but deleted
the taxon a posteriori without commenting on its relationships. Running
their matrix indicates it falls within coelurosaurs more derived than
tyrannosauroids, but outside known compsognathids, ornithomimids,
therizinosaurs, alvarezsauroids, scansoriopterygids, oviraptorosaurs
more derived than <i>Caudipteryx</i>
and paravians, with a basal ornithomimosaur or caudipterid position
most likely.  Samathi (2017, 2018) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Kinnareemimus</span>
to Choiniere's coelurosaur analysis and recovered it as a basal
coelurosaur, which is detailed in his 2019 thesis.  If it is
ornithomimosaurian in a revised version of
the Hartman et al. (2019) matrix (with the Angeac taxon more fully
scored and thus moving to Ceratosauria), it falls out in a trichotomy
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Shenzhousaurus</span>, but can be an
alvarezsauroid in trees a single step longer.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Ji et al., 2003) differs from <i>Harpymimus</i>
and more derived ornithomimosaurs in having a postacetabular process
that is gently curved rather than truncated; and from ornithomimids in
having a plesiomorphically straight ischium; differs from <i>Pelecanimimus</i>
in having less teeth (toothless premaxilla and maxilla, ~9 dentary
teeth).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon was first mentioned as "unnamed toothed
ornithomimid" in Makovicky et al.'s (2003) cladogram, seven months
before the full description was published. While used as an OTU in
their analysis, the matrix was never made public, so further
information wasn't known until Ji et al.'s paper was published. Oddly,
the matrix of Ji et al. (2003) was never released either.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Perez-Moreno et al., 1994) seven premaxillary teeth; anteriorly
limited maxillary teeth; about thirty maxillary teeth; about
seventy-five dentary teeth; tightly adhered radius and ulna; metacarpal
I 81% of metacarpal II; metacarpal III 100% of metacarpal II.<br>
(after Cuesta et al., 2022) axial neural spine dorsally tall, with a
posterodorsally tapered, posteriorly projected and rounded apex;
fan-shaped neural spine on posteriormost dorsal vertebrae in lateral
view; evenly developed distal condyles in metacarpal I; poor divergence
between metacarpal II and metacarpal I.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>-
Perez-Moreno et al. (1994) also listed several other features in their
diagnosis. The low snout is
shared with other ornithomimosaurs. Maxillary teeth
larger than dentary teeth are common in theropods. The absence of
interdental plates, unserrated teeth and teeth with constricted roots
are primitive for maniraptoriforms.  The dentary is decurved, not
straight.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was discovered in 1993 and initially noted in a 1994
abstract as the "Las Hoyas theropod", resolved using the same analysis
as its official description but only reported at the time to be in a
clade with troodontids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>. Though
described in a preliminary report by Perez-Moreno et al. (1994), the
detailed description in Perez-Moreno's (2004) thesis will not be
published due to the author leaving the paleontological community, nor
will those in possession of it distribute the document. The postcrania
have since been described by Cuesta et al. (2022), but the skull has
yet to be described in detail. Note contra Cuesta et al., the two
complete posterior dorsal vertebrae are not the last two, as the
anterior third of another vertebra is articulated with them posteriorly
(unpublished photo).  <br>
Perez-Moreno et al. originally reported "integumentary structures"
consisting of "subparallel fibers arranged perpendicular to the bone
surface, and a less conspicuous secondary system parallel to it." While
a connection between these and feathers was initially popular, Briggs
et al. (1997) determined they were muscles fibers. In addition, the
preserved skin is scaleless and wrinkled, and the presence of a soft
cranial crest and throat pouch were confirmed.<br>
Taquet and Russell (1998) believe <i>Pelecanimimus</i> could be a
spinosaurid based on- seven premaxillary teeth; a median longitudinal
crest in the temporal region (soft in <i>Pelecanimimus</i> and
misinterpreted in <i>Irritator</i>); a jugal that does not contact the
antorbital fenestra (untrue in <i>Pelecanimimus</i>); maxillary teeth
larger than dentary teeth (true of most theropods); large number of
dentary teeth (also present in <i>Shuvuuia</i>); absence of
interdental plates (also in most maniraptoriforms); narrow and shallow
skull with an elongated facial region (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span>). The large number of
premaxillary teeth is best seen as a convergence, given the otherwise
maniraptoriform skeleton. <br>

fossa on lateral condyle of metacarpal III.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Harpymimus</i> was originally briefly described by
Barsbold and Perle (1984a, b), with additional elements illustrated by
Barsbold and Osmólska (1990). It was described in depth by Kobayashi
(2004), which was published as Kobayashi and Barsbold (2005). Though
Barsbold and Perle and Currie et al. (1990) describe the tooth
morphology, they were apparently lost by the time Kobayashi reexamined
the specimen. Holtz (1992; pers. comm. from Norell) first suggested the
metatarsus may actually be arctometatarsalian and was disarticulated in
the holotype. However, Kobayashi (2004) verifies no disarcticulation or
distortion is present and the metatarsus really is
non-arctometatarsalian.<br>

?(FPDM-V-980815162) partial manual ungual (~50 mm) (Currie and Azuma,

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Hattori et
al., 2023) deep dorsal tympanic recess with bottom
subdivided by anteroposteriorly oriented lamina; expanded spherical
cavities within prezygocentrodiapophyseal and centrodiapophyseal fossae
in dorsal vertebrae; deep
anterolateral pit on proximal part of humerus.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Although
Hattori et al.'s (2023) diagnosis cites "expanded spherical cavities
within prezygocentrodiapophyseal, centrodiapophyseal and
postzygocentrodiapophyseal fossae", they later specify "in all dorsal
neural arches ... the spherical cavity is present at least within the
prezygocentrodiapophyseal fossa", and Figure 3 shows this is also true
of the centrodiapophyseal fossa.  Only mid dorsal neural arch
FPDM-V-11314 shows one in the postzygocentrodiapophyseal fossa however,
so while this could still be disgnostic of a particular vertebral
position in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span>, its
absence in mid dorsal FPDM-V-11311 makes
it unwise to use as an apomorphy for all dorsals (or even mid dorsals)
of the taxon.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Note metatarsal
FPDM-V-8582 is
not present in the referred element list of Hattori et al.
(2023).  While they say
"FPDM-V-11311 (holotype) includes a partial right neurapophysis of the
posteriormost, tentatively regarded as the fifth, sacral vertebra",
other genera regarded by them as deinocheirids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>) have six sacral
vertebrae (as do all otheir
macrocheiriforms), so it is regarded as the sixth here.  The
paratype materials list
says "a pedal ungual" is preserved, but the description states "There
are two pedal unguals in the paratype."  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Early finds</span>- Currie and Azuma
(2006) listed
FPDM-V-980815162 as an "elongate, relatively straight manual ungual",
and stated "Manual unguals collected from the same quarry suggest that
there may have been as many as three different types of small theropods
in the fauna" and "At least two other theropod taxa [distinct from
<span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuiraptor</span>] can be recognized
in the fauna from teeth and manual
unguals, but in the Kitadani Quarry these coelurosaurs are rare
animals."  Azuma et al. (2013) state "<span class="HwtZe" jsaction="mouseup:Sxi9L,BR6jm; mousedown:qjlr0e" jsname="jqKxS" lang="en"><span jsaction="agoMJf:PFBcW;MZfLnc:P7O7bd;nt4Alf:pvnm0e,pfE8Hb,PFBcW;B01qod:dJXsye;H1e5u:iXtTIf;lYIUJf:hij5Wb" jsname="txFAF" class="jCAhz ChMk0b" jscontroller="Gn4SMb"><span class="ryNqvb" jsaction="click:E6Tfl,GFf3ac,tMZCfe; contextmenu:Nqw7Te,QP7LD; mouseout:Nqw7Te; mouseover:E6Tfl,c2aHje" jsname="W297wb">The

similar to </span></span></span>FPDM-V-8579, the total ungual length
may have been about 50 mm.  Furthermore, the height/width ratio
(at the
proximal break?) is said to be 1.24, within the range of other
ornithomimosaurs measured by Kobayashi.  Azuma et al. also mention
two
other manual unguals "<span class="HwtZe" jsaction="mouseup:Sxi9L,BR6jm; mousedown:qjlr0e" jsname="jqKxS" lang="en"><span jsaction="agoMJf:PFBcW;MZfLnc:P7O7bd;nt4Alf:pvnm0e,pfE8Hb,PFBcW;B01qod:dJXsye;H1e5u:iXtTIf;lYIUJf:hij5Wb" jsname="txFAF" class="jCAhz ChMk0b" jscontroller="Gn4SMb"><span class="ryNqvb" jsaction="click:E6Tfl,GFf3ac,tMZCfe; contextmenu:Nqw7Te,QP7LD; mouseout:Nqw7Te; mouseover:E6Tfl,c2aHje" jsname="W297wb">FPDM-V8579

condition although there is a defect in the distal part", and indeed
those measurements are only of the preserved portions as shown by their
eventual illustration in Hattori et al. (2023).  Azuma et al. also
report "</span></span></span><span class="HwtZe" jsaction="mouseup:Sxi9L,BR6jm; mousedown:qjlr0e" jsname="jqKxS" lang="en"><span jsaction="agoMJf:PFBcW;MZfLnc:P7O7bd;nt4Alf:pvnm0e,pfE8Hb,PFBcW;B01qod:dJXsye;H1e5u:iXtTIf;lYIUJf:hij5Wb" jsname="txFAF" class="jCAhz ChMk0b" jscontroller="Gn4SMb"><span class="ryNqvb" jsaction="click:E6Tfl,GFf3ac,tMZCfe; contextmenu:Nqw7Te,QP7LD; mouseout:Nqw7Te; mouseover:E6Tfl,c2aHje" jsname="W297wb">The
height-to-width ratios of the distal phalanges of these forelimbs are

dorsoventrally flatter than any ornithomimosaurs measured by Kobayashi
except for <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>. 
They identified all three unguals as
ornithomimosaurian based on "the distal location of the flexor
tubercle."  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A new taxon</span>- Hattori et al.
(2023) included </span></span></span>FPDM-V-8579
and 8580 as referred specimens of their new taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus
fukuiensis</span> but did not mention FPDM-V-980815162.  Regarding
the hypodigm, they stated "Each specimen was collected from the same
layer (Bonebed I) except for FPDM-V-11343", but a layer for the latter
specimen was not given, and Currie and Azuma (2006) never specify which
layer
of the quarry FPDM-V-980815162 was found in either.  Based on the
presence of seven ilia in Bonebed I, at least four individuals were
present, but this could be augmented by knowing how many right vs. left
elements there are and if any are significantly smaller as some other
isolated elements are (FPDM-V-11314, 11323, 11339) which could belong
to one or more younger individuals.  That being said, Hattori et
al.
correctly say "the unfused conditions of the braincase and the
vertebral neurocentral sutures represent a possible immaturity of the
holotype", and this is additionally true for isolated dorsals and
sacrals FPDM-V-11314 through 11320.  Whether any of the isolated
referred materials represent larger and thus posssibly adult
individuals requires further documentation and research.  <br>
Hattori et al.
noted "the overall morphology and the length (7.88 mm) of the cochlear
duct of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span> are
similar to those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>
(AMNH FR
5355: ca. 7 mm)" and thus "it is suggested that the audibility of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span> was comparable to
that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>."<br>
Hattori et al. used Choiniere's coelurosaur matrix to recover
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span> as a deinocheirid
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span>,
or if only the
holotype is scored, as a deinocheirid in a polytomy with other members
of that family.  When added to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph
matrix, it is a very basal ornithomimid, but can be a garudimimid with
3 steps and sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Harpymimus</span>
with 6 steps.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Rozhdestvensky (1977) first mentioned ornithomimids
from the Yalovach Formation, but they were first described and
illustrated by Alifanov and Averianov (2006). Unlike <i>Gallimimus</i>,
the proximal caudal prezygapophyses are dorsoventrally level with the
transverse processes, though their humeri are nearly identical. The two
Yalovach femora differ from one another in the proximodistal positions
of their anterior and fourth trochanters and <i>caudofemoralis longus</i>
fossa. They are more proximally positioned in PIN 3041/1 and <i>Archaeornithomimus?
bissektensis</i> than in PIN 3041/4. Perhaps multiple ornithomimsaur
species are present in the Yalovach.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Rozhdestvensky and Khozatsky (1967) mentioned
ornithomimid remains from the Bostobe Formation, but Averianov (2007)
is the first to describe and illustrate them. The tibia differs from <i>Gallimimus</i>
and the Bissekty ornithomimid in having a a lower and less sharp
fibular crest that is of constant height along its length and extends
further proximally than the distal end of the cnemial crest. It also
differs from <i>Gallimimus</i> in having two nutrient foramina. 
Averianov et al. (2017) described an associated specimen (IZK
1432/2012) that differs from <i>bissektensis</i> in having a reduced
pedal ungual flexor tuber and resembles Yalovack Formation material in
having a dorsally angled femoral head. <br>

"remains ... of small predatory dinosaurs of the
family Ornithomimidae" from Shiregin Gashun (his Shiregin-gashun).<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000a) mention an "ornithomimid tibia" from Shine Us
Khuduk found in August 14-16 1993, and list 930821 BTs-IV-1 as
"Ornithomimosaur metatarsal II, pubis" from Bayshin Tsav.  The
latter was prepared in 1994 (Matsumoto et al., 2000), the final
material list is "one pubis, one metatarsal-II, one phalange and two
caudal vertebrae", and it was given the number HMNS 94-3-16. 
Watabe and Suzuki also list HMNS 94-3-10 under its field number 930820
BTS-II-3 as "tyrannosaurid ilium, sacral vertebrae" discovered on
August 20 at Bayshin Tsav, but after preparation it was reidentified as
"ornithomimosaur" (Matsumoto et al., 2000).<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000b) list 940618 KgT-m NAR as "Ornithomimid femur,
tibia, fibula" found on June 18 1994 at Khongil Tsav-III, and 940625
BTs II as "Ornithomimid femur, caudal vertebrae, digits" found on June
25 1994 at Bayshin Tsav-II.  The latter was prepared in 2000
(Tsogtbaatar, 2004), who lists the material as "part of femur, partial
cerrvical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, phalanges of manus, some ribs"
and state it is stored at the IGM.<br>
Suzuki and Watabe (2000) report "several skeletons of small
ornithomimid theropods (mass burial)" from Bayn Shire discovered on
August 4-5 1995, but say they were uncollected.  They also list
950807 KgT Ornithomimid as "Ornithomimid pes" from Khongil Tsav,
collected on August 7.<br>
Watabe
and Suzuki (2000c) report the collection of "at least 4
skeletons of ornithomimid" from Bayn Shire on August 4-5 1996, catalogd
as 960804-5 BS TSGT.  They include a photo of "bone bed
with ornithomimid skeletons in fine sandstone layer (middle horizon),
Bayn Shire."  Tsogtbaatar (2004) lists these as being prepared
from 1996-1998 and consisting of "isolated limb bones 3-4
individuals."  Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig (2010) list this as
960804 BS Ornith. TSGT., "incomplete postcrania" prepared more from
2006-2009.<br>
Barsbold et al. (2007) and Kobayashi et al. (2014) mention a specimen
discovered in 2005 from Shine Us Khuduk, and reported to possess
distinctive characters such as all manual phalanges twisted (I-1
twisted medially), anterior intercondylar fossa on the femur and robust
metatarsal V.  Kobayshi et al. state it "differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> in having
arctometatarsalian metatarsals and the presence of pedal digit I and
clearly belongs to Ornithomimidae", but as <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> has pedal digit I this
detail may be a typo.  <br>
Tsubamoto et al. (2010) state "a ornithomimid skeleton" was discovered
in 2007 at Khongil Tsav, listed as 080922 KgT KHB "Ornithomimid
skeleton" found on September 22.  <br>
Chinzorig et al. (2017) reported a bonebed of at least four individuals
of two taxa found in 2010.  One individual has an ilium shorter
than the pubis as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
(but also "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>"
"mongoliensis), one has an arctometatarsus unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
(and like "mongoliensis"), while two manual morphologies are
present.  "Type I has a proximally positioned medial divergence of
metacarpal I and nearly straight slender manual unguals with anteriorly
positioned flexor tubercles. Type II has more distally positioned
medial divergence of metacarpal I than Type I and ventrally curved
robust manual unguals."  Type I matches "mongoliensis", while Type
II matches at least some unguals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Beishanlong</span>
so may be <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>. 
Tsogtbaatar (2019) described this bonebed, finding at least five
individuals and two taxa.<br>
Chinzorig et al. (2018) used two Bayanshiree ornithomimosaur hands
besides "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>"
"mongoliensis" IGM 100/14- IGM 100/132 and 100/202.  While
measurements of 100/132 are provided, the third Bayanshiree
ornithomimid is incorrectly labeled IGM 100/125 (an <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
specimen) in the supplementary info and no measurements are
listed.  IGM 100/132 has more strongly curved unguals based on the
published graphs, so may be more likely to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> while 100/202 would
then be "mongoliensis".  It's likely one of these specimen numbers
is the Shine Us Khuduk specimen.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>"
"mongoliensis" are the two named ornithomomosaurs from this formation,
and based on available information part of the Bayshin Tsav bonebed and
IGM 100/132 may be <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>,
while another part of the Bayshin Tsav bonebed, IGM 100/202 and/or the

<b>Material</b>- (IGM 100/987) (adult) partial braincase, proatlantal

<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was found in 1993 mixed with the <i>Byronosaurus</i>
paratype. It differs from <i>Struthiomimus</i> and <i>Gallimimus</i>
in having shallow basal tubera; <i>Struthiomimus</i> and <i>Garudimimus</i>
in having a tubercle between the basal tubera; <i>Struthiomimus</i>, <i>Sinornithomimus</i>
and <i>Garudimimus</i> (but not <i>Gallimimus</i>) in the absence of
a posterior supraoccipital ridge; <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Garudimimus</i>
in having a narrow quadrate; and <i>Gallimimus</i>, <i>Sinornithomimus</i>
and <i>Garudimimus</i> (but not <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>) in having a
deep posterior quadrate fossa. This was referred to <i>Gallimimus
bullatus</i> by Kobayashi (2004) without comment, but is more likely to
be the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Aepyornithomimus</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This material differs from <i>Garudimimus,

100/1245 though, and its closed sutures suggest it is an adult. Thus
100/1245 may represent a distinct larger species of ornithomimosaur.<br>

(2000a) mention a "ornithomimid pelvic part (pubis-ilium)" found on
September 16 1993 from Gurilin Tsav, as well as "ornithomimid bones:
ribs, distal end
of tibia, digits, and scapula fragments." found on September 24-29 1993
at the Northern Sayr.<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000b) report "isolated bones of ... ornithomimid"
discovered on July 21-28 at Altan Uul IV.<br>
Watabe and
Tsogtbaatar (2004) stated "an ornithomimid partial skeleton" was found
on August 10-11 2000, later described as "partially articulated
postcranial elements of ornithomimid".  The pes is photographed as
"a
pes of an ornithomimid dinosaur discovered in Yagaan Khovil", though
note that the artificial articulation switched phalanx III-3 and
IV-3+IV/4.  The third metatarsal is arctometatarsalian. 
Tsogtbaatar (2004) indicates the specimen was prepared in 2001 and
consists of "femur, tibia, fibula, pes, cervical and dorsal
vertebrae."  Watabe and Tsogtbaatar also stated "a claw of an
ornithomimid" was discovered on July 21, and that "ornithomimid digits
and claws" were found.<br>
Discovered in 2005, Badamkhatan (2008) stated "a right proximal end of
a theropod femur was also collected, and it is tentatively identified
as an ornithomimid, possibly <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>."<br>
Watabe et al. (2010) wrote "isolated bones and partial skeletons of
ornithomimid (Theropoda) (probably of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>)"
were found in 2006, two specimens of which were labeled Ornithomimid
instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>-
060823 BgT TSGT and 060823 BgT TSGT found on June 23 and 24
respectively.  They also stated "isolated bones of ornithomimid"
were found that year in Altan Uul and Gurilin Tsav, and "isolated and
articulated bones of ... ornithomimid" at Tsaagan Khushuu, but did not
list collected material.  <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- IGM 100/121 was found
on June 16-27 1995 and identified as "An articulated skeleton of an

field number 95081 BGT Gallimimus as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>

Tsogtbaatar (2004) photographed the skeleton after partial preparation
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus sp.</span>
950818-BgT-Gall-I,II, while Matsumoto et al. (2010) listed it after
further preparation as <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
950818BgT, NAR, Galli.  Kobayashi (2004 and its resulting
publications) refers to it as <i>Gallimimus sp.</i>, with the text
including additional information.  Fujiyama et al. (2011) describe
the process of mounting a display based
on it, which
they call <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>. 
Suzuki and Watabe (2000b) report that "preparation of the skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> (ornithomimid) collected
from Bugin Tsav in 1995 was done" in July 1998.  Manual
measurements and illustration (as a Nemegt ornithomimosaur) are
provided by Chinzorig et al. (2018), while metatarsal measurements (as
Ornithomimidae indet.) are given by Tsogtbaatar et al. (2017). 
Manual
unguals II and III are very different from <span style="font-style: italic;">G. bullatus</span>, being slender
and less recurved, but manual ungual I is strongly curved and robust
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>, IGM
100/133 and 100/134.  The specimen is described in detail by
Tsogtbaatar (2019) as a new taxon.<br>

Discovered on August 17 2006, IGM 100/134 was initially identified by
Watabe et al. (2010) as  <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>. 
The prepared specimen was photographed by Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig
(2010) as "Ornithomimosauria (?<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>)." 
Manual
measurements and illustration (as a Nemegt ornithomimosaur) are
provided by Chinzorig et al. (2018).  <br>

The manual resemblences between these two specimens suggest they belong
to the same taxon, with manual unguals more slender, narrow and less
recurved than <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>, and
narrower unguals and shorter metacarpal I than <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>.<br>

Xu et al. 2012 split this into three new formations and revised their
ages.<br>
This taxon has an arctometatarsus and narrow metatarsus, but retains
pedal digit I. The ilium is similar in shape to basal oviraptorosaurs,
but is said to have a deep brevis fossa and strong supracetabular crest
as in ornithomimosaurs.<br>

<p><b>undescribed ornithomimosaur</b> (Zhao, 1983)<br>
<b>Late Cretaceous<br>
Zonggo Formation, Tibet, China<br>
Material-</b> (IVPP coll?)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1976 (An et al., 2021)
and first reported by Zhao (1983), who while discussing the evolution
of dinosaurs in China noted "ornithomimids (<i>Ornithomimus</i> Marsh)"
in the Late Cretaceous. It might be surmised Zhao was referring to an
undescribed Chinese specimen of <i>Ornithomimus</i>, which is
strengthened by the later mention of an <i>Ornithomimus</i> species
from the same deposits as other Late Cretaceous taxa Zhao mentions
("Megacervixosaurus"). As with other new Tibetan taxa listed by Zhao
(1983), it was probably supposed to be described by Zhao in the
published version of his doctoral dissertation "The Mesozoic vertebrate
remains of Xizang (Tibet), China", in the second Palaeontology of
Xizang volume. Yet this volume is only referenced by Zhao (1983; which
was submitted in September 1981) and seems never to have been printed,
though the previous volume was published by the IVPP in 1980 and the
third by the NIGP in 1981. Olshevsky (DML, 1999) notes the IVPP
rejected the paper as unpublishable. Zhang and Li (1997) list <i>Ornithomimus
sp.</i> from the Zonggu Formation of Zonggu, Markam County, Xizang.
Weishampel et al. (2004) list it as <i>Ornithomimus sp.</i> from the
Zonggo Formation of Xizang Zizhiqu and refer it to Ornithomimosauria.
Whether it is actually <i>Ornithomimus</i> is unknown, though this is
doubtful given its presence in Asia<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The type material was discovered in 1923 between April
22 and May ~25, and described briefly by Gilmore in 1933 as <i>Ornithomimus
asiaticus</i>. AMNH 30240 specimens were collected in April 30
1923.  When Russell (1972) split <i>Ornithomimus</i> into several
genera, he made <i>asiaticus</i> the type species of <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>.
Smith and Galton (1990) later described some of the material in detail,
while Watanabe et al. (2015) described vertebral pneumaticity in
detail. <br>
The remains of <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
are largely disassociated and were originally catalogd under a few
specimen numbers (AMNH 6558, 6565-6570, 6576). AMNH 6570 and 6576 were
later split into several new specimen numbers each, to ensure each
number represented one individual, but a large amount of material
remains catalogd under their original numbers. Smith and Galton
(1990) also listed AMNH 6558, 6566 and 6567 as being recatalogd under
new numbers, but these numbers correspond to additional specimens in
the AMNH collections (pers. obs.). Specifically, the ischia AMNH 6558
are mistakenly said to be recatalogd as 21798 (actually pubes). The
forelimb AMNH 6566 is mistakenly said to be recatalogd as 21796
(actually sacral vertebrae). The pectoral girdle and humerus AMNH 6567
are mistakenly said to be recatalogd as 21795 (actually nine distal
caudal vertebrae). The AMNH online catalog still has a listing for
6576 as "4 coossified sacral vertebrae etc.", though those sacrals are
actually recatalogd as 21790. This agrees with Smith and Galton's
statement the vertebrae of 6576 were later recatalogd and separated
as 21786-21794, though it should be noted some vertebral material
remains in 6576. However, most of the material under that number
consists of over seventy appendicular elements which are not mentioned
in the online catalog and have never been described. Smith and Galton
also mistakenly switch the specimen numbers of AMNH 6566 and 6567. AMNH
21797 is a partial astragalus, contra the AMNH online database which
lists it as neural spines. Smith and Galton list proximal caudal neural
spines of 6576 as being recatalogd as 21889, though that number is a
metacarpal II. There doesn't appear to be an actual specimen consisting
solely of neural spines, though those of 21791 are broken from their
centra. Smith and Galton miss two more anterior dorsal vertebrae in
21789, bringing the total to eight. The new specimen numbers AMNH 21884
and 21888 are switched, with the metacarpal stated to be 21888 and the
ungual 21884. AMNH 21792 consists of eight and a half articulated
distal caudals and AMNH 21794 consists of three articulated distal
caudals plus a separate more proximal distal caudal, suggesting Smith
and Galton's Table 2 switched these as it lists three articulated
vertebrae for 21792 and eight for 21794.  They also switched the
identifications of manual phalanges III-2 and III-3 and II-1 and II-2.
Currie and Eberth (1993) noted both Gilmore and Smith and Galton
misidentified pedal phalanx II-1 of the lectotype as IV-1, which seems
correct given its morphology. The AMNH online catalog doesn't have any
material listed for AMNH 6570, though an enormous amount of material is
catalogd under that number in the museum. While Makovicky (1995)
listed an axis, sacrum and pelvis under that number, no axis was
observed in the collection, only two sacral centra were present, and
the only pelvic elements under that number are an ilium and distal
pubis. Watanabe et al. (2015) state "Based on manual articulation of
disarticulated sacral vertebrae, we identify the two sacral vertebrae
(AMNH FARB 21790) sampled for this study as the second and third sacral
vertebrae", but these are the second and third caudals as identified by
Smith and Galton as confirmed by personal observation when sacrals 2-5
were on loan articulated to the ilium.  Similarly, two of the
proximal caudals Watanabe et al. call AMNH 21790 are actually the last
two vertebrae in AMNH 21802.  Gilmore (1933) noted two proximal
scapulae were present in the <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> material, but
only one was observed in the collections. Similarly, he lists six
humeri as present, but only four were located.<br>
Similarly problematic are the localities the specimens were discovered
at, as Smith and Galton (1990) claim "Specimen numbers AMNH 6558, 6565,
6569, and 6576 from Quarry 140; AMNH 6570 from Quarry 141", but as the
field numbers above show (taken from personal observation at the AMNH)
that this either isn't always true or wasn't recorded correctly (e.g.
6576 from 141, as well as 21786, 21890, 21792 and 21794 that were
originally parts of 6576; 6570 from 140, as well as 21797, 21799-21802,
21884 and 21885 that were originally parts of 6570).  AMNH 30240
was from the more northward Quarry 142.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other material</span>- The AMNH
catalog lists 6267 and 6268 as <i>Ornithomimus sp.</i>, but they are
probably <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
based on stratigraphy.  Given their lower specimen numbers, it is
likely these were recovered in the initial reconnaissance expedition to
Iren Dabasu in 1922 (April 25 to May 7) and represent the "Carnivorous
dinosaurs of at least two genera, the smaller one being of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span> type" reported by
Granger and Berkey (1922).  Indeed, those authors later state
"Remains of the small <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>-like
creature are particularly abundant and the last day at Iren Dabasu we
picked up probably fifty good foot bones and centra from two or three
knolls", which matches the listed material.  The locality of AMNH
6267 is listed as "Iren Dabasu Sta. 1 1/2 SW of auto trail", so was
plausibly from one of the western AMNH quarries (131-138), as opposed
to the type material that was from the Kaisen Quarry (AMNH locality
140) and Johnson Quarry (AMNH locality 141) which were discovered the
following year.  The AMNH online catalog also lists AMNH 21626
and 21627 as possibly referrable to <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>. AMNH
21597 is figured as therizinosaurid ungual on the AMNH online catalog,
but the low curvature and distally placed flexor tubercle are instead
almost identical to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
(e.g. AMNH 6570, 6576).  Currie and Eberth (1993) state "The
present whereabouts of a partial skull found by the Sino-Soviet
expedition is currently unknown", but their paper's details indicate it
was found in June 1959 from their localities K (= AMNH locality 141?),
L or P, and initially stored in either the IVPP or PIN. Chow and
Rozhdestvensky (1960) specified the timing of excavations to be June 14
to July 17 and state "materials collected include ... small ornithopods
(of <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span> type)",
with 'ornithopods' presumably a typo for 'theropods', and Currie and
Eberth state "more than a thousand bones" were identified as
ornithomimid in the filed from the Sino-Soviet expedition.  Currie
and Eberth also say that after the joint BMNH - Inner Mongolian Museum
expeditions of 1972-1977, "Some of the specimens (including
ornithimimid ... skeletons) were prepared for display in Hohhot", with
casts at the Erenhot Dinosaur Museum.  These were mostly from
localities on the west side of Iren Nor.  Dong (1992) noted that "<span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
is the most common species in the bone beds" where the CCDP excavated
in July 1988 (and later in 1990), which would have ended up in the IVPP
as no theropod body fossils from Iren Dabasu are at the TMP.  A
distal caudal described by Makovicky (1995) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> "has the morphology of a
typical
coelurosaurian distal caudal, but is otherwise undiagnostic. The
possibility that it may originate from an avimimid is suggested by its
small size. It should be noted, however, that it could just as
conceivably be from the tail of a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span> from the same
bonebed."  Indeed, the <span style="font-style: italic;">A.
nemegtensis</span> bonebed show <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
has short distal caudals like other caenagnathoids and unlike
ornithomimosaurs, so this specimen is here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>.  Godefroit
et al. (1998) reported "one single ornithomimid caudal vertebra" from
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Bactrosaurus</span>
bonebed they described from Locality SBDE 95E5, slightly to the west of
AMNH locality 140.  Yao et al. (2015) note "small unarticulated
bones and teeth, including
fossils of ... ornithomimids" from "a rare microvertebrate locality
within the Iren Dabasu Formation, about 16 km northeast of Erenhot
City."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">More than one taxon?</span> There is
non-ornithomimid material catalogd under <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>,
including a juvenile ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Bactrosaurus</span>
ungual (in AMNH 6576), a small ?troodontid pedal ungual I (in AMNH
6576) and part of an ?oviraptorid manual ungual I (in AMNH 6570). <br>
Currie and Eberth noted variability in preserved elements, suggesting
more than one species of ornithomimosaur are represented. They further
suggested this additional species may be <i>Garudimimus</i> based on
the possible presence of pedal digit I in <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>,
the incorrect view that <i>Garudimimus</i> may have been
arctometatarsalian, and supposedly similar metatarsal ratio. Kobayashi
(2004) determined <i>Garudimimus</i> really does lack an
arctometatarsus though, and showed the metatarsal ratios are not that
similar (Currie and Eberth's measurements were based on a photograph). <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
is actually distinct from <i>Garudimimus</i> in having lower dorsal
neural arches and spines, lower caudal neural spines, shorter proximal
caudal prezygapophyses, lower ilium, more widely flaring supracetabular
crest posteriorly, longer and deeper posterior pubic boot, less
anteriorly curved femur, less dorsoventrally flared femoral head,
smaller accessory trochanter, shallower distal and posterior femoral
intercondylar groove, less distinct ectocondylar tuber, smaller cnemial
crest, no posterior groove on the proximal tibia, only slightly concave
distal astragalar edge, less concavity anteriorly between astragalar
condyles, arctometatarsus, distally divergent metatarsal II, large
medial flange on distal metatarsal III condyle, narrower anterior edge
on distal metatarsal IV, and straight pedal ungual. Described variation
includes ulnar curvature, which is also known to vary in <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>,
and manual ungual curvature and slenderness, which may be explainable
to their belonging to different digits. Further variation and
distinction from <i>Garudimimus</i>
must rely on unpublished observations of the material, and is probably
moot considering more recent age estimates for Iren Dabasu beds being
Campanian vs. Cenomianian-Turonian for <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>.<br>
Yao et al. (2022) described pelvis and sacrum LH-02-01 discovered in
2002 from an undocumented locality near Iren Nor.  They added the
specimen to Choiniere's coelurosaur analysis to recover it as an
ornithomimosaur in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Nqwebasaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Pelecanimimus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Shenzhousaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Beishanlong</span> and
Deinocheiridae+Ornithomimidae.  Supposed differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
are- larger size (ilium 342 vs. 114 mm); "the shortest sacral centrum
is the second rather than the third [actually the third instead of the
fourth, assuming six sacrals as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>-
Makovicky, 1995]; the centrum of the first caudal is shorter than that
of the fifth [sixth] sacral"; first caudal with flat posterior
articular surface vs. concave; first caudal with flat ventral surface
vs. median groove; first caudal neural spine posteriorly sloped vs.
vertical; pubic shaft straight vs. strongly posteriorly curved;
transition between anterior pubic shaft and dorsal edge of pubic foot
rounded vs. angled; anterior pubic foot more pointed; obturator process
less prominent; ischial foot limited to anterior expansion vs. expanded
some posteriorly; ischiopubic ratio 82% vs. 92%.  However, it
seems the authors depended on the literature for their information on <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
(e.g. thinking the ischia are AMNH 21798 instead of 6558, and that the
first caudal would be amphicoelous and grooved because Smith and Galton
said in the proximal caudal paragraph "The centra are amphicoelous ...
and each has a shallow ventral groove"), and this led to misinformation
and incomplete statements.  Regarding size, there is an ilium ~380
mm long in AMNH 6570, larger than even LH-02-01.  The proximal
five caudals of AMNH 21790 all lack median grooves ventrally and the
posterior articular surface of the first centrum is still attached to a
broken off part of the second centrum so cannot be evaluated.  The
first caudal neural spine has been broken away since Smith and Galton's
drawing, and the shape of the other neural spines differ from the
drawing in greater to lesser degrees.  There is a distal pubis in
AMNH 6570 with an almost identical foot to LH-02-01, including the
rounded anterodorsal edge, more pointed anterior foot and shorter
posterior foot.  Finally, there is no indication pubes AMNH 21799
and ischia AMNH 6558 were associated, and indeed five right proximal
tibiae are known from site 140 that can differ in size ~10% from each
other.  Thus sacra AMNH 21790 and LH-02-01 may be distinct based
on central lengths, pubes AMNH 21799 and LH-02-01 / AMNH 6570 (in part)
seem to be distinct, as do ischia AMNH 6558 and LH-02-01. 
However, undescribed pubes AMNH 21798 are intermediate in having a
slight anterior bow, rounded anterodorsal transition, less pointed
anterior foot and intermediate posterior foot length.  This
suggests the sacral and ischial differences could easily be due to the
low sample size (N = 2) of each element and that considering all of
these specimens to be conspecific is the most realistic and functional
conclusion.  Since the lectotype is a partial pes not comparable
to LH-02-01 at all (and without any proposed diagnosis or comparison to
other Iren Dabasu ornithomimosaur pedal specimens), the other rational
option would be to limit <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus
asiaticus</span>
to AMNH 6565 and potentially other comparable specimens (e.g. AMNH
6568, 21616, 30240B/C and parts of 6570 and 6576) while leaving the
non-pedal specimens as Ornithomimosauria indet..  Alternatively,
LH-02-01 and e.g. AMNH 21790 or 6558 could be given names, but again
the vast majority of specimens would be incomparable and relegated to
Ornithomimosauria indet..  Given this data and pending the
description of some of the multitude of unpublished specimens, all Iren
Dabasu ornithomimosaurs are listed here under <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</span>. 
Adding LH-02-01 to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis results
in it being sister taxon to <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>,
with an enforced sister group of <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Beishanlong</span> or
Garudimimidae+Ornithomimidae only three steps longer.<br>
For completion's sake, <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
is like AMNH 21790 <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
in having the shortest sacral be the fourth, but like LH-02-01 in
having the first caudal shorter than the last sacral, while its pubis
has a slight posterior curve like AMNH 21798, angled anterodorsal
transition, less pointed anterior foot, and very short posterior foot,
indicating it doesn't fit into any of the Iren Dabasu morphotypes.<br>

(15.2-39.5 mm), 7 phalanges II-2, III-2/3 or IV-2/3/4 (20.8-35.3 mm)
and 6 pedal unguals (15.4-36.7 mm) (Sues and Averianov, 2016)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Nessov, 1995) medial femoral condyle more
projected distally than lateral condyle (also in in <i>Garudimimus</i>
and "Saltillomimus").<br>
(after Sues and Averianov, 2016) prominent centrodiapophyseal laminae
on proximal caudal vertebrae. <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Nessov (1995) distinguished <i>bissektensis</i>
from <i>Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</i> based on a couple other
characters. He stated the shaft was more curved, but a small <i>asiaticus</i>
specimen in AMNH 6570 is more curved in lateral view than <i>bissektensis</i>.
The narrow greater trochanter in proximal view is similar to other
ornithomimids (e.g. <i>Garudimimus</i>, <i>Sinornithomimus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i>),
while it is <i>Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</i>' broad trochanter
which is diagnostic. The anterior trochanter is less prominent because
it is incompletely preserved in <i>bissektensis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1995) first published ornithomimid material
from the Bissekty Formation, including the femur (CCMGE 726/12457) that
he made the holotype of <i>Archaeornithomimus bissektensis</i> and a
tentatively referred distal caudal (CCMGE 475/12457). He assigned <i>bissektensis</i>
to <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> based its small size (Sues and Averianov,
2016), but Alifanov and Averianov (2006) noted the holotype is
juvenile, and furthermore some <i>Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</i>
specimens are much larger (femur 402 mm compared to 143 mm in <i>bissektensis</i>).
Many of the elements Nessov referred to other dinosaurs have turned out
to be ornithomimid as well. These include two femora (including CCMGE
479/12457) tentatively referred to tyrannosaurids, and a manual ungual
(CCMGE 431/12457) and pedal unguals (CCMGE 609/12457 and 610/12457)
tentatively to <i>Alectrosaurus sp.</i> (Carr, 2005). Averianov (2007)
noted a tibia is known from the Bissekty Formation as well, which was
also originally assigned to <i>Alectrosaurus</i> by Nessov. It is more
similar to <i>Gallimimus</i> than the Bostobe ornithomimid because the
proximal end of the fibular crest is approximately level with the
distal end of the cnemial crest, and the fibular crest is higher at
mid-length than at either end. It differs from both taxa in lacking a
trough for the fibula with a posterior crest paralleling the fibular
crest. Several other remains assigned to <i>Alectrosaurus</i> by
Nessov are also ornithomimosaurian (femora including CCMGE 724/12457,
astragali including CCMGE 447/12457 and 448/12457, and metatarsals)
according to Averianov and Sues (2012) and Sues and Averianov.
Averianov (2006) mentioned a coracoid (probably ZIN PH 2203/16, figured
by Sues and Averianov) from the Bissekty Formation lacks the vertical
crest distal to the glenoid which is found in the Tokubai and
Khodzhakul ornithomimids. Averianov and Sues also mention several
partial astragali in the ZIN collection referrable to
Ornithomimosauria, one of which (ZIN PH 144/16) was described by Sues
and Averianov. Nessov referred incomplete sacrum CCMGE 474/12457 to cf.
<i>Gallimimus sp.</i> or Oviraptorosauria, but it was identified as
ornithomimid by Sues and Averianov. Nessov also identified CCMGE
449/12457 as a theropod pedal phalanx, which was listed as ornithomimid
by Sues and Averianov, and based on comparisons to <i>Gallimimus</i>
seems to be IV-3. A theropod distal caudal (CCMGE 476/12457) figured by
Nessov was assigned to Ornithomimidae by Sues and Averianov. Another
caudal (CCMGE 725/12457) was originally referred to cf. <i>Dryptosaurus</i>,
Segnosauria or cf. <i>Hypsibema</i>, but was also assigned to
Ornithomimidae by Sues and Averianov. The supposed proximal ulna CCMGE
602/12457 was assigned to ?Hadrosauridae by Nessov, but listed as
ornithomimid material by Sues and Averianov. Nessov assigned CCMGE
613/12457 to his <i>Gilmoreosaurus arkhangelskyi</i> as a surangular,
and Sues and Averianov assigned it to Ornithomimidae and reidentified
it as an ilial fragment (Averianov, pers. comm. 2015). Sues and
Averianov also assigned an element figured by Nessov (1997) as an <i>Azhdarcho</i>
bone fragment to Ornithomimidae, which is also an ilial fragment
(Averianov, pers. comm. 2015).<br>
Sues and Averianov described the Bissekty ornithomimid material in
detail, finding no evidence of more than one taxon, but believing the <i>bissektensis</i>
holotype to be indeterminate. Unfortunately the authors didn't discuss
Nessov's proposed diagnosis, nor did they state which taxa it cannot be
distinguished from. They did find two vertebral autapomorphies though
(the one not listed above is left out because it is also present in <i>Deinocheirus</i>,
<i>Garudimimus</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>- anterior dorsal anterior
and posterior infrazygapophyseal fossae with accessory
centrodiapophyseal laminae). The authors did note multiple species
could still be represented, which seems like as distinct possibility as
little cranial or pelvic material is present, and manual elements are
unassociated. When they scored all Bissekty material as one OTU in a
version of Choiniere's analysis, it emerged as an ornithomimid more
derived than <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> but outside the clade including
<i>Sinornithomimus</i> and other genera.  Adding this OTU to
Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis results in it being sister
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</span>. 
Similar to the Bissekty oviraptorosaur and dromaeosaurid material,
which all may or may not be referrable to <i>Kuszholia</i> and <i>Itemirus</i>
respectively, all ornithomimid material is provisionally referred to <i>Archaeornithomimus?
bissektensis</i> here.<br>

metatarsal II, but the illustrated complete metatarsal is labeled III.
It is here assumed to be a typo in the figure. <br>
This specimen's history is described in depth on the Dinosaur Kingdom
Nakasato website (Takei, online 1997). It was discovered in 1996 by
Takei as part of a collaborative research project between International
Internship Programs (Japan) and Mongolian Academy of Sciences, and
examined by Barsbold at the GIN. Though originally thought to be a <i>Harpymimus</i>,
it was identified as a new genus by Barsbold in October as part of a
press release. Barsbold met with the Nakasato website support team in
April 1997 to discuss the specimen and suggested ""Grusimimus tsuru" or
"Tsurumimus" seems to be suitable for this new ostrich-mimic." Both <i>Grus</i>
and tsuru mean crane, the latter in Japanese. Molina-Perez and
Larramendi (2019) used "Grusimimus tsuru" as a nomen nudum for this
specimen. Kobayashi and Barsbold (2002) presented a poster and abstract
on the specimen, which they found to be phylogenetically between <i>Harpymimus</i>
and <i>Garudimimus</i>. Kobayashi (2004) later described the specimen
in depth in his unpublished thesis as Ornithomimosauria indet. and
found it to occupy an unresolved trichotomy with <i>Harpymimus</i> and
more derived ornithomimosaurs based on a larger analysis. He did note
several differences from <i>Harpymimus</i> (see diagnosis), though he
stated these could be ontogenetic instead of taxonomic. Kobayashi and
Barsbold (2005) mention the taxon as the Huren-duh ornithomimosaur.
When and whether it will be formally described and named in a published
paper are unknown.  Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as a
garudimimid.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Makovicky et al., 2010) large size (also in <i>Deinocheirus</i>,
<i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i>); notched anterior
caudal neural spine; mid caudal centra with ventral keel; at least one
mid caudal vertebra with accessory neural spine; mid caudal vertebrae
with prominent ridges connecting pre- and postzygapophyses; scapula
with pronounced fossa at anterior end of supraglenoid buttress;
coracoid with prominent lateral ridge emanating from coracoid tuber
(also in <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>); curved manual ungual I, but
straighter unguals on digits II and III (also in <i>Harpymimus</i> and
<i>Archaeornithomimus</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Makovicky et al. (2010) noted additional
characters in their diagnosis with wider distributions. The shallow
coracoid with a deep notch between the glenoid and postglenoid
processes, the subarctometatarsal pes and the curved pedal unguals are
symplesiomorphic for ornithomimosaurs. The curved ischial shaft is
shared with ornithomimids.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Makovicky et al.'s paper was first released
electronically in April 22 2009 but not officially published until
January 22 2010. The name was first published in print in September
2009 as part of an SVP abstract (Makovicky et al., 2009), but this was
still a nomen nudum as abstracts are not allowed for official
publication (ICZN Article 9.10). <br>
IVPP V12756 was discovered in 1999 and mentioned by You (2002), then
described by Shapiro et al. (2003) as an unnamed basal ornithomimosaur.
Makovicky et al. (2010) described a partial skeleton discovered in 2006
as the new taxon <i>Beishanlong grandis</i>. They thought IVPP V12756
and a pair of pubes found near the holotype in 2007 might be referrable
as well, in addition to an undescribed specimen represented by hindlimb
elements. Makovicky et al. found <i>Beishanlong</i> is more derived
than <i>Shenzhousaurus</i>, but less than <i>Garudimimus</i> in their
analysis.  Lee et al. (2014) later found it to be closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>, which was also the
result in Hartman et al. (2019).<br>

compared to pubic length (&lt;80%); deep groove at proximal end of
lateral surface of pedal phalanges III-1 and III-2.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Garudimimus</i> was originally briefly described
by Barsbold (1981), with additional elements illustrated by Barsbold
(1983) and Barsbold and Osmólska (1990). Currie and Russell (1988)
illustrated the metatarsus as <i>Oviraptor sp.</i>, incorrectly giving
it an arctometatarsal condition. It was described in depth by Kobayashi
(2004), which was published as Kobayashi and Barsbold (2005). This
redescription showed the supposed orbital horn is actually a
disarticulated prefrontal. Holtz (1992; pers. comm. from Norell) first
suggested the metatarsus may actually be arctometatarsal and was
disarticulated in the holotype. This was also believed by Currie and
Eberth (1993), and Holtz (1994) stated the arctometatarsaly was
developed in similar degree to <i>Chirostenotes</i>. However,
Kobayashi verifies no disarticulation or disortion is present and the
metatarsus really is subarctometatarsal. Currie and Eberth used this
and the supposedly identical metatarsal length ratios to suggest <i>Garudimimus</i>
was present in the Iren Dabasu Formation and that the metatarsus and
perhaps other material currently referred to <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
belongs to it. Yet Kobayashi showed that in addition to actually
lacking arctometatarsaly, the metatarsal ratios are also quite
different.  Additional specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Garudimimus</span>
may be known among the many undescribed Bayanshiree ornithomimosaur
specimens that have been reported, including part of Chinzorig's (2017)
Bayshin Tsav bonebed and IGM 100/132 of Chinzorig et al. (2018).<br>

This is the traditionally recognized Ornithomimidae, generally thought
of as the arctometatarsal ornithomimosaurs lacking pedal digit I. 
All Late Cretaceous American ornithomimosaur specimens are
provisionally placed in this clade, as all valid taxa from that place
and time belong to it.  While Kobayashi (2004) set the current
consensus of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span> clade and an
American <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span> plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromiceiomimus</span> clade, the former is
based on two coracoid characters, both present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Beishanlong</span> as well and at least
one (anteriorly placed coracoid tuber) not actually present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>.  This site
instead follows Hartman et al.'s (2019) topology where <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> groups with <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromiceiomimus</span>,

on tibia.<br>
(suggested) cnemial crest anteroposteriorly deep, with anteroproximally
sloping proximal edge and angled anterior edge.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Leidy described the tibiae ANSP 9222 as the new
species <i>Coelosaurus antiquus</i>, provisionally assigning AMNH
2550-2553 to the species as a syntype. Cope (1868) made the AMNH
specimens the holotype of his new species <i>Laelaps macropus</i>,
which was synonymized with <i>C. antiquus</i> again by Matthew and
Brown (1922). However, this specimen seems to be a dryptosaurid
tyrannosauroid (see entry for <i>Dryptosaurus? macropus</i>). <br>
Baird and Horner (1979) realized the theropod genus <i>Coelosaurus</i>
was preoccupied by <i>Coelosaurus</i> (Owen, 1854), an indeterminate
centrum with a broken but fused neural arch and subcircular
amphicoelous ends. They thus placed the species in <i>Ornithomimus</i>
instead, though they did not compare it to other ornithomimids. Horner
(1979) referred all Maastrichtian New Jersey ornithomimids to <i>antiquus</i>
(though note AMNH 2549 is a crocodylian femur, contra his table), as
did Baird (1986) out of convenience. These are a caudal from New Jersey
(ANSP 9151), a caudal (MAPS A1226) and femur (YPM PU 22361) from the
Mount Laurel-Wenonah Formation, a femur from the Severn Formation (USNM
256614) and a tibial fragment from the Navesink Formation (YPM PU
21825). Only the latter is from the same formation as the lectotype,
and while comparable, is too fragmentary to refer with confidence.
Baird also stated a pedal phalanx III-1 (MMNS VP103) from the Eutaw
Formation of Mississippi was identical to <i>antiquus</i> (comparing
to a <i>macropus</i>
specimen), but this is probably tyrannosauroid instead. Russell (1972)
and Holtz (1992) considered the lectotype indeterminate, Russell within
Ornithomimidae and Holtz within Theropoda. Gallagher (1993) regarded
all Eastern North American ornithomimosaur specimens as juvenile
dryptosaurs including antiquus (listed as "= <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus antiquus</span>") and YPM PU
21825.  Sullivan (1997) sunk <i>Ornithomimus velox</i> and <i>O.
edmontonicus</i> into <i>antiquus</i> as <i>Ornithomimus antiquus</i>,
because the <i>edmontonicus</i> holotype and the <i>antiquus</i>
lectotype share a distinctive cnemial crest morphology, and because
Russell (1972) and most later authors found <i>O. edmontonicus</i> and
<i>O. velox</i> to be morphologically identical. Specifically, <i>antiquus</i>
has a cnemial crest which has a straight edge parallel to the shaft
proximally and then abruptly angles toward the shaft. Indeed, this is
absent in <i>Garudimimus</i>, <i>Sinornithomimus</i>, <i>Anserimimus</i>,
<i>Gallimimus bullatus</i> and <i>"G."</i> "mongoliensis", but present
in <i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i> (including the <i>edmontonicus</i>
holotype), <i>D. samueli</i>, <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i>, and <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>.
<i>Struthiomimus</i> is somewhat intermediate. As <i>O. velox</i> is
in fact distinct from <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> and doesn't preserve the
proximal tibia, this character cannot be used to synonymize it with <i>antiquus</i>
or even to place <i>antiquus</i> into <i>Ornithomimus</i>. <i>Ornithomimus?
sedens</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> differ in having a shallower and
less proximally angled cnemial crest, while that of <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
is even less angled proximally. <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> further
differs in having a large medial bulge placed just posterior to the
cnemial crest and in being more flared distally. There are no
characters placing <i>antiquus</i> closer to <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
than to <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i>, so while the tibia does differ
from other ornithomimids, it cannot be placed in a known genus or
species. Brusatte et al. (2012) agree, finding the taxon to be valid
and inside the <i>Gallimimus</i>+<i>Ornithomimus</i> clade.<br>

<b>Late Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Hell Creek Formation, Montana, US</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (LACM 47520; intended holotype of "Orcomimus") partial
skeleton including proximal caudal series, pelvis including pubis,
incomplete hindlimbs including metatarsal III, metatarsal IV (~438 mm)
and pedal unguals (Glut, 1982)<br>
<b>Late Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Hell Creek Formation, South Dakota, US<br>
Material</b>- ?(NSM coll.) distal caudal vertebra, coracoid, phalanges,
manual unguals (Triebold and Russell, 1995)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Triebold and Russell (1995) first used this name in
the poster session for their SVP abstract (Olshevsky, DML 1998a), and
Triebold (1997) later published it in a faunal list for the Sandy site,
along with <i>Struthiomimus</i> and <i>Ornithomimus</i>.
Olshevsky (DML, 1998) stated "Dale Russell tells me that Rob Long
coined the name when he and Dale were working on Hell Creek theropods
(the putative type specimen is at the Los Angeles County Museum). Both
have since been sidetracked by other projects and will probably not
return to Hell Creek theropods soon."  This allows us to connect
it to a specimen first mentioned by Glut (1982).  He said Russell
and Long "will describe some new Upper Cretaceous dinosaurs based upon
elements from the Hell Creek beds of Montana, including a new species
of large ornithomimid."  Russell (1984) listed this as an
undescribed genus, to be published by "Long and Russell in
prep.".  It was then mentioned by DeCourten and Russell (1985) as
an "ornithomimid from the Hell Creek Formation (under study
by R.A. Long and D.A. Russell)", who noted several aspects of its
anatomy. The proximal caudal centra have similar proportions to MNA
Pl.1762A, <i>O? sedens</i> and some <i>Gallimimus</i> vertebrae
(posterior width ~57% of length). The anteriorly convex pubic shaft is
similar to <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>, MNA Pl.1762A and <i>O? sedens</i>.
The anteroposteriorly flattened distal metatarsal III (ratio of depth
to width .82) is unlike <i>Archaeornithomimus</i> and <i>Ornithomimus</i>.
Finally the pedal unguals with gently curved ventral edges are
primitive for ornithomimosaurs, and unlike <i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>,
<i>Archaeornithomimus</i>, <i>Ornithomimus </i> and <i>O? sedens</i>. 
There is only one ornithomimid listed in the LACM online database from
the Hell Creek Formation of Montana represented by more than a couple
elements, LACM 47520, an articulated mount on exhibit as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>.  It was
discovered in 1972 and photos show it was large (metatarsal IV 30%
larger than <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>'
holotype) has an anteriorly convex pubic shaft, seeming to confirm its
identity as the intended type specimen of "Orcomimus".  McFeeters
(2015) said it was on display at the LACM "as a specimen of
Struthiomimus, but this identification is not definitive (Luis Chiappe,
pers. comm. 2014)" and listed four pubic characters "consistent with
more basal Asian ornithomimids outside of the normally recognized
"Laramidian clade."".  However, in regards to "Orcomimus"
McFeeters stated "Dale Russell (pers. comm. 2014) does not presently
consider the latter name to be adequately supported, and considers this
material, as well as the "undescribed genus" of Russell (1984), to
merely indicate the presence of multiple ornithomimids in the Hell
Creek Formation, not a specific new taxon that warrants a name." 
But of course LACM 47520 has to belong to some taxon, which is
seemingly different from named taxa whether or not Russell's original
concept of "Orcomimus" is still valid.  The Sandy site
was discovered in 1994, so that "Orcomimus" material would then be
referred (note Russell and Manabe 2002 indicate Sandy site remains are
curated at the National Science Museum, Tokyo, Japan).  Bartlett
(2004) states thirty-three ornithomimid elements were recovered from
the Sandy site.  "Manus claws and phalanges were the only
specimens
definitely ascribed to the group. The claws were referable to the
larger form <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>,
while other bones may pertain to this taxon
or to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>
proper."  Indeed Russell and Manabe's (2002)
figure 2 shows two ornithomimid manual unguals (third and sixth from
left in second row) that are more curved as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span> compared

from right on the top row and fourth from right in the third row are a
coracoid and distal caudal vertebra respectively that appear
ornithomimid, so more Sandy material than merely phalanges and unguals
exists.  While McFeeters says "Manabe (pers. comm. 2014) presently
considers all of the Sandy Site ornithomimid material indeterminate at
the generic level", the diagnostic nature of ornithomimid caudals,
coracoids and unguals makes this unlikely.<br>

more posteriorly than anteriorly; pubic boot has almost straight
ventral edge; femur robust and having more sigmoidal shape.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
This material was discovered in 1998, and described as a new genus and
species of ornithomimid in Aguillon Martinez' (2010) thesis. Names in
theses aren't usually listed on this site prior to official
publication, but Aguillon Martinez herself announced it at an event at
the Museo del Desierto on November 20, 2014 (Martinez, 2014) and it has
since been published in Ramirez-Velasco and Hernandez-Rivera (2015).
The latter state "This species is still not formally described, and
according to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature
the new name of the species is considered invalid", so it is still a
nomen nudum.  Note the manual ungual was found at the same
locality as the holotype, but cannot be compared to it. <br>

the little information currently known. Similar things could be said
about the tail illustrated by Rauhut (2003), which he referred to
Ornithomimosauria indet.. Russell (1972) listed several specimens as
indeterminate.<br>
While Longrich (2008) distinguished the caudals of his new taxon as

compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>,
but Funston (2020) later recognized "a calcaneum that is deeply incised
and an ascending process inset from the lateral surface of the
astragalocalcaneum both argue for a non-oviraptorosaur identity of TMP
1993.036.0631 and TMP 1995.074.0049. Instead, these elements are
identical to those described by McFeeters et al. (2017), and should
therefore be regarded as ornithomimids."  <br>

antiquus</i> (under which he also included <i>O. velox</i> and <i>O.

morphology is also present in <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>
and <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i> (see <i>"Coelosaurus"</i> entry).
While the proximal angle of the crest does resemble <i>"Coelosaurus"
antiquus</i> more than these other taxa, the bone is crushed to
exaggerate this, which also makes its anteroposterior depth uncertain.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Lambe (1902) referred some material to his new taxon <i>Struthiomimus
altus</i>, while Osborn (1916) questionably referred AMNH 5262 and 5264
to <i>Ornithomimus velox</i>. Russell (1972) listed the AMNH
specimens, CMN 12227 and the Regina Museum specimen as indeterminate.
He also listed ROM field number 1, 1923 as an indeterminate
ornithomimid, but this has been described as a <i>Chirostenotes</i>
specimen (ROM 43250). Carrano (1998) listed TMP 1981.010.0002 as
Tetanurae indet., which is identified as ornithomimid by Eberth et al.
(2013) and the TMP online catalog.  Confusingly, Carrano also
lists a smaller femur as "TMP 81.10.2?".  Longrich and Currie
(2009) listed TMP 2001.045.0085 as ?<i>Ornithomimus</i>, and several
subsequent specimens have been listed by Eberth and Currie (2010) and
Larson et al. (2010), with the latter illustrating 2001.045.0085 as
well. The material is probably <i>Struthiomimus</i> sp. nov. or <i>Dromiceiomimus
brevitertius</i> based on stratigraphy, but has not been described.<br>
Three individuals preserved together were reported by Cullen et al.
(2010, 2012), who noted no cranial or manual material was preserved and
little material anterior to the pelvis at all. PCA analysis of pedal
material could not identify them to genus level. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The BENC material was
discovered in the 1990s and described by Serrano-Branas et al. (2020)
as paratypes of their new supposed deinocheirid <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus
normalensis</span>.  However, only the distal metatarsal IV of
BENC
1/2-0091 and pedal unguals of 30/2-001 are shared with the proposed
holotype.  <span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">The paper
lists no proposed apomorphies or unique combination of characters for
distal metatarsal IV, and the specimens preserve largely
non-overlapping fragments of this element.  Pedal ungual
characters are</span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;"> listed
in the diagnosis- </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">"(9)
distinctively broad and ventrally curved pedal unguals that angled
downward with respect to the proximal articular surface and depending
on the digit, the proximodorsal process becomes slightly enlarge and
changes its position from nearly horizontal to mostly vertical,
adopting a lipshaped appearance; and (10) pedal unguals with a rounded,
large foramen on the medial side* and a deep ventral fossa that
surrounds a strongly developed, ridge-like flexor tubercle."  </span></span><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span class="goog-text-highlight" style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ventral curvature is plesiomorphic,
the unguals of BENC 30/2-001 are not broader than other
ornithomimosaurs', and ventral angling with the proximal end held
vertically is common in theropods and present in e.g. <i>Garudimimus </i>and
<i>Beishanlong</i>.  The proximodorsal process "changing its
position" is using a difference between 30/2-001's mostly horizontal
processes and the intended holotype's more vertical process as
character, which in itself presupposes they are the same taxon. 
The ventral fossa surrounding a ridge-like flexor tubercle is also
present in <i>Harpymimus</i>, <i>Garudimimus</i>, <i>Beishanlong </i>and
large Dinosaur Park unguals (NMC 1349, TMP 1967.019.0145) and is not
shown in the intended holotype but is claimed to be "partially
broken."  This leaves the medial foramen, which might be a valid
character in unguals III and IV (II is damaged in that area), but might
also be taphonomic, as there are many other small circular areas of
damage (e.g. center of proximal surface of ungual IV).  While the
two unguals in 30/2-001 are similar to each other, that of the intended
holotype is more strongly curved, has that smaller more dorsally angled
proximodorsal process, is wider in proximal view, and lacks the
expanded ventral half characteristic of ornithomimosaurs that is
present in the other specimen.  <br>
While <span style="font-style: italic;">Paraxenisaurus</span> itself
is here regarded as Averostra incertae
sedis due to the seemingly abelisaurid-like proximal metatarsal III,
the proposed paratypes largely match ornithomimids.  For instance,
the distal caudals of 1/2-0092 have neural spines unlike paravians, but
are more elongate than tyrannosauroids, therizinosaurs or
oviraptorosaurs and are amphicoelous unlike alvarezsaurids. 
Similarly, distal metacarpal I of 1/2-0054 is similar in shape to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>, but more triangular
than tyrannosaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>,
caenagnathids or <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
and is of course unlike the modified elements of abelisaurids or
alvarezsaurids.  The reduced ginglymoidy is also like
ornithomimids, but unlike carnosaurs, therizinosaurs and the other
taxa, except not nearly as reduced as in abelisaurids. 1/2-0091 is the
most controversial, though the absent femoral extensor groove is like
abelisaurs and most maniraptoriforms, but unlike carnosaurs,
tyrannosaurids or <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>. 
Contradicting this, supposed proximal metacarpal III is broader than
metacarpal II and round, the latter unlike tetanurines although
matching ceratosaurs.  Abelisaurs' metacarpals are far more stout
with reduced distal condyes though, suggesting this is probably not a
metacarpal III at all and more likely a proximal radius. 
Similarly, the supposed distal metatarsal IV has a transversely flatter
distal edge than typical of theropods and may instead be metatarsal
III.  While many Late Cretaceous taxa lack a ginglymoid metacarpal
III, those of abelisaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Megaraptor</span>,
tyrannosaurids and alvarezsaurids are all reduced in structure, while
those of caenagnathids and deinonychosaurs are reduced in width
compared to metacarpal II.  Given the ginglymoid structure in
therizinosauroids, ornithomimosaurs match best.<br>
Serrano-Branas et al. (2020) also refer several other Cerro del Pueblo
elements to Ornithomimidae.  While pedal ungual </span></span>BENC
1/2-0094 is ornithomimid and caudal centrum BENC 30/2-002 plausibly so
(with tyrannosaurid being the other obvious option), distal femur BENC
1/2-0093 is far more distally expanded compared to the shaft (2.62
times) than typical of Mesozoic theropods with a nearly closed
popliteal fossa and pointed ectocondylar tuber like alvarezsaurids, but
without the distally projected and pointed lateral condyle of the
latter.  Perhaps it is a bird instead?<br>

?(UW 27205) (Lillegraven and Eberle, 1999)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Claessans and Loewen, 2016) metacarpals I and
II apposed for relatively short distance, only first quarter of their
length; short and robust metatarsus (depth of mtIII diaphysis divided
length of mtIII 11%).<br>
(proposed) metacarpal I longer than metacarpal II (also in <i>Anserimimus</i>
and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>); relatively wide metatarsal IV; narrow
pedal unguals (also in <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The syntypes were discovered in 1889 and described the
next year by Marsh (1890).  Russell (1972) found the syntypes are
of the right size to belong to the same individual, contra Marsh. 
Claessens et al. (2011) have prepared the specimens from the matrix and
reexamined them, which led to its redescription by Claessens and Loewen
(2016). The latter identified the material as adult and described three
manual phalanges not previously published. <br>
<i>Ornithomimus</i> was originally separated from <i>Struthiomimus</i>
based on the supposed absence of metatarsal V (Osborn, 1916), though
Gilmore (1920) and most later authors agreed the <i>Ornithomimus</i>
holotype probably had metatarsal V in life and merely didn't preserve
it. All ornithomimids were referred to <i>Ornithomimus</i> by most
authors until Russell's (1972) revision separating <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>,
<i>Struthiomimus</i> and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, and some even
continued afterward (e.g. Paul, 1988).  Though very fragmentary,
the species has generally been placed with <i>edmontonicus</i> (here a
junior synonym of <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>) based on the long metacarpal
I. Yet this is also present in <i>Anserimimus</i>. Sternberg (1933)
distinguished it from <i>D. brevitertius</i> (his <i>O. edmontonicus</i>)
by smaller size, lower and broader astragalar ascending process, and
comparatively broader metatarsus. The metatarsus proportions were
commented on by Russell, who thought the proximal and distal metatarsal
pieces do not contact, but this has been recently disproven (Claessens
and Loewen, 2016). In fact, Russell stated the syntypes to be
indistinguishable from <i>D. brevitertius</i> (his <i>O. edmontonicus</i>),
though this is untrue. <i>O. velox</i> has a medial condyle on
metacarpal I which is placed dorsally to the lateral condyle, space
between metacarpals II and III, a third metacarpal which isn't placed
ventral to metacarpal II proximally, and straight pedal unguals. 
Hartman et al. (2019) were the first authors to analyze <span style="font-style: italic;">O. velox</span> as a separate OTU from <span style="font-style: italic;">O. edmontonensis</span> and recovered it
more basally positioned sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithomimus</span>,
with 3 steps needed to force <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>
monophyly.<br>
The additional materal referred by Carpenter and Young (2002) to <i>O.
velox</i> has not been described yet, nor have the specimens referred
to <i>O. cf. velox</i> by Lillegraven and Eberle (1999). Osborn (1916)
questionably referred several specimens from the Horseshoe Canyon
Formation of Alberta to <i>O. velox</i>, including AMNH 5201 (now <i>Dromiceiomimus
brevitertius</i>), 5255 (tyrannosaurid hindlimb), 5257 (<i>Struthiomimus
sp. nov.</i>), 5262 and 5264 (possible ornithomimids). He did the same
for fourteen specimens from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana,
including AMNH 975 (<i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i>), 5884 (listed as <i>Ornithomimus
sp.</i> on the AMNH online collections database), 5050 (<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
dentary), 5851 (<i>Thescelosaurus</i> humerus and femur), 1006, 5003,
5016, 5017, 5018, 5051 (all indeterminate ornithomimids- Russell,
1972), and 974, 5014, 5015 and 5019 (indeterminate theropod remains).
DeCourten and Russell (1985) described MNA Pl.1762A as <i>Ornithomimus
velox</i>, but it is kept separate below.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Barsbold announced this species in a press conference
on October 18 1996 at the Nakasato Dinosaur Center based on IGM 100/14.
It's uncertain whether the name made it to print then, so it is
credited here to Kobayashi and Barsbold (2006). Details about the
species were available starting in 1997 on the Nakasato Dinosaur
Center's website, making this an online-only name until recently.
Kobayashi (2004 and its resulting publications) refers to it as <i>Gallimimus
sp.</i>, with the text including additional information. 
Kobayashi and Barsbold (2006) noted the distinctiveness of IGM 100/14
compared to <i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>,
but did not officially name the taxon. They did illustrate the
metacarpus and manual unguals, and photos of the mounted skeleton,
skull and manus are available online at the Nakasato Dinosaur Center
website and elsewhere. The manus and metatarsus are illustrated by
Kobayashi (2004), while manual measurements are provided in Chinzorig
et al. (2018).  Hartman et al. (2019) found it groups with <span style="font-style: italic;">Tototlmimus</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>, taking 3 steps to make
the genus monophyletic.<br>
Several other Bayanshiree specimens are potentially referrable to this
taxon, including part of the Bayshin Tsav bonebed of Chinzorig et al.
(2017), IGM
100/202 (Chinzorig et al., 2017) and/or the Shine Us Khuduk skeleton
(Kobayashi et al., 2014).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- <i>Ornithomimus sedens</i>' holotype was discovered
in 1891 and described briefly by Marsh in 1892. It was later described
in detail and illustrated by Gilmore (1920). Neither Marsh nor Gilmore
noted any diagnostic characters, and assigned the species to <i>Ornithomimus</i>
because they assigned all known ornithomimids to that genus. Russell
(1972) could not refer it definitively to <i>Ornithomimus</i>, <i>Struthiomimus</i>
or <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, though he noted the proximal caudal
proportions were intermediate between the latter two. Hartman et al.
(2019) scored only the hoilotype and found <span style="font-style: italic;">sedens</span> to emerge sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Rativates</span> and Kaiparowitz specimen
MNA Pl.1762A, so neither in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>
nor <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>.<br>
Carrano (1998) used "<i>Struthiomimus</i> cf. <i>sedens</i>" for BHI
1266 in his thesis, but theses don't count for nomenclature in the
ICZN. Farlow (2001) is the first published reference I know of to use
the combination <i>Struthiomimus sedens</i>, though he did so in
quotation marks. These authors used the combination for a recently
discovered specimen BHI 1266, which was also featured in Rainforth
(2003), Senter and Robins (2005) and Bates et al. (2009) as <i>Struthiomimus
sedens</i>, but has yet to be described. It is very complete, as can be
seen on the BHI website. While it does share some characters with <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
these are either plesiomorphies (short metacarpal I) or characteristic
of a larger group including <i>Gallimimus</i> and other taxa (short
skull; manual ungual III longer than phalanx III-3), except for the
elongate manus, which is uniquely over 107% of humeral length in the
two taxa as opposed to other post-<i>Harpymimus</i> ornithomimosaurs.
Unfortunately, only the proximal pubes appear to be shared between it
and the <i>sedens</i> holotype (judging by the in situ photograph of
BHI 1266). Yet they are of similar size, share characters with the same
group of ornithomimids, and from the same formation. They are thus both
referred to the same taxon here.<br>
UCMP 154569 was found in 1994 and tentatively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Struthiomimus</span>
by Blake (2016), who diagnosed it using- "a ratio of 7% maximum
metatarsal III diaphysis anteroposterior width divided by length of
metatarsal III, lack of a square distal cross section of metatarsal III
where the ratio between anteroposterior and transverse diameters is
about 0.81, and proximal overlapping contact where metatarsal II meets
metatarsal IV."<br>
Russell (1972) reported a first manual ungual from the Frenchman
Formation of Saskatchewan that resembles that of <i>Struthiomimus</i>.
Based on stratigraphy, it may be <i>"Ornithomimus" sedens</i> instead.
Longrich (2008) has made the most explicit recent commentary on <i>
sedens</i>, referring it to <i>Struthiomimus</i>, and referring
several specimens to the species (AMNH 975, BHI 1266, TMP
1986.047.0004, UCMP 154569). He did state that further study was needed
to determine if the holotype and 'cotype' are diagnostic. According to
Gilmore (1920), there is no 'cotype' however.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after McFeeters et al., 2016) maxilla with contact
for jugal short and blunt; mid caudal neural spines mound-like and
anteroposteriorly reduced in transition point region; posterior contact
of ischial shafts convex and completely fused; distal end of third
metatarsal without concavity on flexor surface, and with straight
flexor edge in distal view.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1934 and initially
listed by Sternberg (1950) as <i>Struthiomimus</i>. Russell (1972)
included it in <i>S. altus</i>, and used the skull for his composite <i>Struthiomimus</i>
cranial reconstruction. McFeeters et al. (2013) noted characters of the
specimen, while McFeeters et al. (2015) removed it from <i>S. altus</i>.
This was formalized by McFeeters et al. (2016), who named the taxon <i>Rativates
evadens</i> and provided a complete description. They found the taxon
to emerge more derived than <i>Sinornithomimus</i> and <i>Gallimimus</i>
using Choiniere et al.'s <i>Nqwebasaurus</i> matrix.  Hartman et
al. found it to fall out sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ornithoimimus"
sedens</span> and Kaiparowitz specimen MNA Pl.1762A in their analysis.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Holtz, 1992) metatarsal IV backs metatarsal
III proximally. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- DeCourten and Russell (1985) described the fragmentary
ornithomimid specimen MNA Pl.1762A as <i>Ornithomimus velox</i> based
on the subequally broad and deep distal metatarsal III, straight pedal
unguals and elongate pedal ungual II.  Holtz (1992) stated that
metatarsal III posteriorly overlaps IV slightly in proximal view in MNA
Pl. 1762A, but not in the <i>velox</i> syntype, while Claessens et al.
(2011) note it lacks the metatarsal II/IV ratio of <i>O. velox</i>. 
Hartman et al. (2019) found it to emerge sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Rativates</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ornithomimus" sedens</span>, instead of
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus velox</span>.<br>
Neabore et al. (2007) refer UMNH VP 16385 to <i>Ornithomimus sp.</i>,
but Lavender et al. (2010) found it to be more similar to <i>O. velox</i>
than '<i>O. edmontonicus</i>' (<i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i>).
Claessens et al. (2011) noted UMNH VP 19467 is more similar to <i>O.
velox</i> than MNA Pl.1762A in having a metatarsal II longer than IV.
However, their resulting paper (Claessens and Loewen, 2016) stated the
elongation of the Kaiparowirz specimens' metatarasus was unlike <i>velox</i>
and that the former two are "virtually identical." Zanno et al. (2013)
note a number of undescribed Kaiparowitz remains and illustrate the
manus of UMNH VP 16385. They also illustrate the distal caudal UMNH VP
16260, noting it lacks the interzygapophyseal and ventral
prezygapophyseal grooves seen in <i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i>.
Further study is needed to show how many taxa are represented in the
Kaiparowitz, and exactly how they relate to <i>O. velox</i>.<br>

<p><b><i>Struthiomimus</i></b> Osborn, 1916<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Makovicky et al., 2004) manus 8% longer than
humerus (also found in <i>Ornithomimus? sedens</i>).<br>
(after Longrich, 2008) frontal with an orbital rim that is completely
convex in dorsal view; frontals abruptly expanding posteriorly, with
the anterolateral edge angled 40 degrees to the midline; strongly
flattened dorsal edge of distal caudal vertebrae; ventrolateral edges
of pedal unguals rounded (unknown in most taxa).<br>
(after McFeeters et al., 2015) more anteriorly projecting pubis with
pubic boot ahead of ilium; more sinuous profile of metatarsal III.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Osborn (1916) erected <i>Struthiomimus</i> for
<i>Ornithomimus altus</i> because it possessed metatarsal V, which he
incorrectly thought was absent from <i>Ornithomimus velox</i>. Later
authors often realized Osborn's error and synonymized the genera,
though Parks (1926, 1928, 1933) did name four additional species in <i>Struthiomimus</i>
because they possessed the metatarsal (<i>S. ingens, S. currelli, S.
brevetertius</i> and <i>S. samueli</i>). Russell (1972) revised
ornithomimid taxonomy and was the first author to use real
morphological differences to validate the separation of <i>Struthiomimus</i>
from <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus </i> (and his new genus <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>),
though several characters he cites are now seen as invalid due to the
recent synonymization of <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> with <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i>. Notably, <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> <i>samueli</i> also
has a humerus shorter than its scapula, antebrachium length overlaps <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>',
and preacetabular, tibial, metatarsal and pedal digit length are no
longer distinct. Furthermore, all the characters proposed by Russell to
be apomorphies of <i>Struthiomimus</i> are symplesiomorphies when
viewed in a cladistic context. The robust forelimb is plesiomorphic,
being seen in all ornithomimosaurs except <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, <i>Gallimimus
bullatus</i> and <i>Sinornithomimus</i>. The curved manual unguals are
also plesiomorphic, present in all ornithomimosaurs except <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>,
<i>Anserimimus</i> and <i>"Gallimimus"</i> "mongoliensis". <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
is the only ornithomimosaur known with a presacral column not longer
than its hindlimb, as opposed to <i>Deinocheirus</i>, <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
<i>Anserimimus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Sinornithomimus</i>. The
proximal caudal centra are also posteriorly wide (over half their
length) in <i>Deinocheirus</i>, <i>Garudimimus</i>, "Grusimimus", <i>Gallimimus</i>,
MNA Pl.1762A and <i>"O" sedens</i>. The transition point is also
posterior to the fourteenth caudal in <i>Deinocheirus</i>, <i>Harpymimus</i>,
<i>Anserimimus</i> and <i>Gallimimus</i>. Metacarpal I is shorter than
metacarpal II in all ornithomimosaurs except <i>Anserimimus</i>, <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
and <i>Ornithomimus</i>. The elongate manual ungual I (longer than
ungual II) may be primitive for ornithomimids, also being present in
"Grusimimus", <i>Sinornithomimus</i> and <i>Anserimimus</i>. The
elongate manual ungual III (longer than phalanx III-3) is also found in
<i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>, <i>"G."</i> "mongoliensis" and <i>"Ornithomimus"
sedens</i>. Makovicky et al. (2004) proposed an elongate manus (&gt;7%
longer than humerus) as an additional apomorphy of <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
and this seems to be true as it is otherwise present only in the
somewhat distantly related <i>"Ornithomimus" sedens</i>, <i>Harpymimus</i>
and <i>Pelecanimimus</i>. Kobayashi et al. (2006) and Longrich (2008)
both proposed a small skull (&lt;50% of femoral length) is unique to <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
but this is also found in <i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>, <i>"G."</i>
"mongoliensis" and <i>"Ornithomimus" sedens</i>. Longrich also
proposed many characters to distinguish <i>Struthiomimus</i> from <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
(<i>Ornithomimus</i> in his use) and his new large Dinosaur Park
ornithomimid, but most were not examined in a broader context. The
convex ventral maxillary edge is also seen in <i>Gallimimus bullatus</i>,
<i>Sinornithomimus</i> and probably <i>"Gallimimus"</i>
"mongoliensis", for instance. <i>Gallimimus bullatus</i> shares the
short postorbital portion of the frontal and dorsally flat distal
caudal centra (in posterior view).  Broad pedal unguals also seem
plesiomorphic, being present in <i>Anserimimus</i>, <i>Gallimimus
bullatus</i> and <i>Garudimimus</i>. Finally, the elongate
proximodorsal process on its pedal unguals is primitive, found in <i>Sinornithomimus</i>,
"Grusimimus", <i>Garudimimus</i> and <i>Harpymimus</i> as well.<br>

- less slender metacarpus.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1901 and described in
1902 by Lambe as a new species of <i>Ornithomimus</i>. In addition to
the associated holotype material, Lambe described other remains "With
these, as probably belonging to the same species..." This includes
several juvenile <i>Daspletosaurus</i> premaxillary teeth. A supposed
posterior dorsal vertebra (plate XIV figure 1) is actually a proximal
caudal, though it could belong to another taxon instead. Of the
illustrated distal caudal vertebrae, those of plate XIV figure 2-5 and
plate XV figure 3-5 do seem to be <i>Struthiomimus</i>, while that in
plate XV figure 1-2 may be <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> instead based on its
slender proportions. The supposed manual ungual in plate XV figure
10-11 is not ornithomimid and may be a <i>Troodon</i> pedal ungual II
instead. Found with this and apparently similar unguals and manual
phalanges were an astragalus, calcaneum, pedal phalanges and two
elements identified by Lambe as distal ends of metacarpal I and
metatarsal I. A metatarsal I would exclude ornithomimids from
consideration, but a calcaneum would exclude troodontids. It's probable
some material was incorrectly associated or misidentified. Regardless,
there's no reason to refer it to <i>Struthiomimus</i>. The pedal
ungual in plate XV figure 8-9 may be either <i>Struthiomimus</i> or <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>.
A supposed posterior dorsal vertebrae questionably referred to a "small
individual" (plate XV figure 6-8) seems to actually be a deinonychosaur
proximal caudal vertebra. He referred further Dinosaur Park material to
<i>altus</i> as well, though this may be <i>Dromiceiomimus samueli</i>
or Longrich's (2008) new ornithomimid. One specimen is from the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation, so may be <i>S. sp. nov.</i> or <i>D.
brevitertius </i> instead. Osborn (1916) described two new specimens,
separating <i>altus</i> from <i>Ornithomimus</i> as his new genus <i>Struthiomimus</i>.
Many authors kept <i>altus</i> as a species of <i>Ornithomimus</i>
until Russell's (1972) revision of ornithomimid taxonomy, where he
noted several new specimens and distinguished it from <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
(including his <i>Ornithomimus</i> <i>edmontonicus</i>)
using several postcranial ratios. Nicholls and Russell (1981, 1985)
described a new specimen, the former publication concentrating on the
gastralia and sternal processes and the latter on the pectoral girdle
and forelimb. McFeeters et al. (2017) figured the calcaneum. 
Makovicky and Norell (1998) described the braincase of AMNH 5355 in
detail. Currie and Russell (2005) listed a specimen (TMP 1994.126.0001)
was Ornithomimidae indet., which was later partly illustrated as <i>Struthiomimus
altus</i> by Serrano-Branas et al. (2016). Longrich (2008) noted <i>S.
altus</i> is only known in the Dinosaur Park Formation, with the
Horseshoe Canyon specimens belonging to a new unnamed species of the
genus. McFeeters et al. (2015) restudied <i>Struthiomimus</i> and
found the holotype may have diagnostic pedal phalangeal characters, but
is not as solidly conspecific with more complete specimens as usually
supposed. ROM 1790 was proposed to be a separate taxon based on several
characters and was later made the holotype of <i>Rativates</i>
(McFeeters et al., 2016), while CMN 8902 was also separated as closer
to <i>Qiupalong</i>
as later described in detail by McFeeters et al. (2017). 
McFeeters et al. (2018) figure the pedal unguals of the holotype.

by Osborn (1916). The new skeleton TMP 1990.026.0001 was first
published by Sereno (2001), who illustrated the skull and mandibles in
his paper on alvarezsaurids. Its morphology has been commented on
subsequently by Claessens (2004), Kobayashi (2004 and published
versions), Ali et al. (2008), Longrich (2008), Cuff and Rayfield (2015)
and Tsuihiji (2017). Longrich noted the Horseshoe Canyon specimens of <i>Struthiomimus</i>
belong to a distinct species, but neither specimen has been described,
nor has the species been fully diagnosed.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Specimens in the hypodigm were first discovered in
August 1963 and mentioned by Kielan-Jaworowska and Kowalski (1965)<span style="font-weight: bold;">.  </span>The
holotype and ZPAL MgD-I/1 were discovered in June 1964- "an incomplete
skeleton of a small (about 2.5 m long) ornithomimid dinosaur,
consisting of a flattened, but well preserved skull, incomplete pelvic
girdle, complete hind limbs and tail, found by Skarzynski, and an
almost complete, though poorly preserved skeleton of a large specimen
(5 m long) of ornithomimid dinosaur, found by Kielan-Jaworowska"
(Kielan-Jaworowska and Dovchin, 1968).  ZPAL MgD-I/1 was noted by
Gradzinsky (1970) as "Tsagan Khushu, No. 1".  <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallmimus</span> was not named and
described until 1972 however. While the braincase and postcrania were
described in detail, some braincase features were reidentified by
Currie and Zhao (1993), the mandible of ZPAL MgD-I/1 was described
fully by Hurum (2001), and vertebral pneumaticity of ZPAL MgD-I/94 was
described by Watanabe et al. (2015).  <i>"Gallimimus"</i>
"mongoliensis" (IGM 100/14) is here placed closer to <i>Tototlmimus</i>
than to <i>Gallimimus</i>. Paul (1988) noted the beak shape was
restored incorrectly by Osmólska et al. (1972).  Note that most of
the specimens referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
have not been referred based on characters distinguishing it from <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>
and the at least two additional unnamed Nemegt ornithomimosaurs (IGM
100/121 and 100/133 plus 100/134), so should be reevaluated once these
other taxa are described in detail.<br>
Osmólska et al. (1972) stated "Furthermore, some material of this
species is known to be stored in the Palaeontological Museum, Academy
of Sciences of the USSR, Moscow, but was not referred to in this paper."<br>
Barsbold (1983) first lists IGM 100/12 as a referred skull and
postcranial skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus
bullatus</span>. 
Makovicky and Norell (1998) list several braincase characters. 
Caudal and appendicular measurements and several character states were
listed in Kobayashi's (2004) thesis.  It was also considered a <span style="font-style: italic;">G. bullatus</span> specimen by Kobayashi
and Barsbold (2006), who mentioned a few other forelimb characters.<br>
Kurzanov and Bannikov (1983) note "a skeleton of the ornithomimid <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> sp." from Shar Tsav,
which was then considered to be part of the Baruungoyot, but has since
been placed in the Nemegt.<br>
The ZPAL collections website beginning in 1996 lists ZPAL MgD-I/2 as
being <span style="font-style: italic;">G. bullatus</span> "from
Nemegt and Barun Goyot formations", but it is not mentioned in the
literature.<br>
Currie (1998) lists hindlimb measurements of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
specimen 100/52, while Zanno (2010) states it has ventrolateral ridges
along its cervical centra and Tsogtbaatar et al. 92017) lists
metatarsal measurements.<br>
Rensburger and Watabe (2000) illustrate histology of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
specimen HMNS 940813, which would seem to correspond to a
Japan-Mongolia Joint Paleontological Expedition field number from
Khermeen Tsav (presumably the Upper White Beds that correlate to the
Nemegt Formation).<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000a) mention skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> found at the Central
Sayr of the Nemegt locality on September 27 1993, and a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
femur" found on September 18 at Tsagan Khushu.  Matsumoto et al.
(2000) note two articulated hindlimbs from the Nemegt material were
prepared in 1996 and given the number HMNS 95-11-44.  These are
photographed, and compared to paratype ZPAL MgD-I/94, the toes are
longer, the proximal metatarsus and distal metatarsal III width are
intermediate between it and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span>,
and the shorter metatarsal II/IV ratio is more like <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>.  The tibiotarsal
condyles are proximodistally deeper, but tibiotarsal curvature
differences may be taphonomic.<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000b) collected "skeleton of ornithomimid (<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>?)" 940817 KmT-I OTG from
the Upper White Beds of Khermeen Tsav on August 17 1994, listed as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
ischium,ilium,pubis, caudal vert.".  It was prepared in 1996 where
the caudals were reidentified as sacrals and another ilium was noticed,
and was given the numbers HMNS 94-10-17, 94-10-18 and 94-10-19, still
identified as "Ornithomimid (possibly genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>)" (Matsumoto et al.,
2000).  Watabe and Suzuki also mention a "long tibia of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>?" found on August 28
from Gurilin Tsav, and list 940824 BgT ENKH as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> caudal vertebrae" found
at Bugin Tsav on August 24.  This latter specimen is probably the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> skeleton (pelvic to
caudal parts)" mentioned in the text.<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000c) report a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
nearly complete skeleton" from Altan Uul II found on July 21-28 1997,
though a field number was not listed.  Chinzorig et al. (2018)
illustrated the manus of IGM 100/142 from Altan Uul II.  The
morphology of the manus closely matches the <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> type, suggesting correct
referral.  Watabe and Suzuki also mention "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> isolated bones and fore
limb" or "isolated bones of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
(hind limb, pes and manus)" from Altan Uul III, which correspond to "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> metacarpals and leg
bones" specimen 970727 AU-III WTB 13:00 and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
leg bones" specimen 970727 AU-III SND both found on July 27. 
970727 AU-III WTB 13:00 is probably the specimen photographed as
"articulated manus of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>,
Altan Ula III (western Gobi region, Nemegt Basin)."  Note this is
not IGM 100/142, as the latter's left metacarpals are not broken, but
the strongly curved unguals support this being <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> as well.  Watabe
and Suzuki also state "partial bones of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>" from Altan Uul II were
collected.<br>
Suzuki and Watabe (2000) report "forelimb of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> was also discovered" on
July 30 1998 at Bugin Tsav, and "isolated bones of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>" found on August 2 at
Khaichin Uul.<br>
Norell et al. (2001) photograph IGM 100/1133, a skull and mandibles
with preserved keratinous beak.  This is also near certainly the
"partially crushed but remarkably complete skull of Gallimimus bullatus
from the Late Cretaceous Tsaagan Khushu locaility" Norell and Bever
(2007) CT scan to investigate braincase anatomy, with this illustrated
in Bever and Balanoff (2017).<br>
Matsumoto et al. (2010) listed 980809GT GU as <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
"pelvic part and left hindlimb" from Gurilin Tsav.  Note while it
was said to be collected on August 9 2004, that would be a field number
040809Gt and the expedition was at Bayshin Tsav on that date.  The
hindlimb is photographed as "articulated hindlimb of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> (2004-11-100)."<br>
Watabe et al. (2010) report "isolated bones and partial skeletons of
ornithomimid (Theropoda) (probably of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>)"
from Bugin Tsav discovered in 2006, of which 060817 BgT BD and 060823
BgT TUI were collected and referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>.  <br>
Lee et al. (2011, 2018) reported a bonebed discovered in August 2009
which was already largely destroyed by poachers, but which included an
articulated pes (IGM 100F/17), possibly ornithomimid footprints and
fragments left by the poachers.  They refer it to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span> based on the
unconvincing argument "all anatomical features of MPC-D100F/17 match
the foot of <span style="font-style: italic;">Galllimimus</span>" and "<span style="font-style: italic;">Anserimimus</span> is not a well-known
taxon and knowledge of its foot skeleton is incomplete."  <br>
Witmer (2012 online) has a cast of a skull with mandibles in his lab,
which is a privately owned specimen from the Nemegt Formation on sale
at Gaston Design (online 2019).<br>
Gannon (online 2014) reported on a legal case (U.S. Attorney's Office
Southern District of New York, online 2014) where smuggled dinosaurs
were being returned to the CMMD in Mongolia, including "a rock slab
containing two <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
skeletons" and "two additional <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>
skeletons."  Gannon's (online 2014) news story about it includes
photos of the two articulated individuals, which are juvenile and also
include the knee of a third individual.  The lower individual
includes gastroliths, a first for <span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus</span>. 
These are labeled Ornithomimidae at the CMMD, with the plaque
indicating it was from the Nemegt Formation and the map point
positioned at Shar Tsav as far as Nemegt localities are
concerned.  Todd (online 2017 1, 2) shows photos of the two
others, a skull and an articulated partial postcranial skeleton. 
The latter is labeled Ornithomimosaurus at the CMMD, with the plaque
indicating it was from the Nemegt Formation of Gurvantes som, making
several loaclities possible (Altan Uul, Bugin Tsav, Gurilin Tsav,
Khaichin Ula, Khermeen Tsav, Nemegt, Tsaagan Khushuu).<br>
Tsogtbaatar et al. (2017) list metatarsal measurements of "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gallimimus bullatus</span> UALVP cast from
Warsaw", which the UA website indicates must be UALVP 49395 from the
Late Cretaceous of Mongolia.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Barsbold (1988a,b) only briefly described some of the
material - the pectoral girdle, manus and metatarsus. However, Hwang et
al. (2004) and especially Kobayashi (2004 and resulting publications)
have both coded it for their data matrices, and the latter describes
numerous features as well. Kobayashi and Barsbold (2006) illustrated
the humerus and manus and described some further aspects of the taxon.
The holotype is mounted and online photographs reveal it to be nearly
complete. Bronowicz (2005) describes and illustrates additional
fragmentary specimens in his thesis. These were later published in 2011
as aff. <i>Anserimimus</i>, as they differ from the holotype in manual
phalanx III-3 is longer than II-2, the manual unguals are less
dorsoventrally compressed and have less developed side alae. While this
may be correct, the holotype has yet to be described in detail,
phalangeal proportions are known to vary in other ornithomimid species,
and variation in ungual flattening or ala size have yet to be examined
in other taxa. As they are from the same formation, they are
provisionally placed in the same taxon here.<br>

<p><i><b>Dromiceiomimus</b></i> Russell, 1972 <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Russell, 1972) length of presacral
vertebral column less than combined lengths of femur, tibia-astragalus
and metatarsal III; posterior width of proximal 15 caudal centra less
than half of central length (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
transition point between proximal and distal segments of tail occurs
before caudal 14.<br>
(after Makovicky et al., 2004) bifurcated dorsal process of the
quadratojugal (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>); deep embayment along
the posterior border of the quadratojugal for the paraquadratic foramen
(unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>). <br>
(after Kobayashi et al., 2006) accessory process of the anterior
process of the postorbital (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>); ridge and
groove articulation between prezygapophyses and postzygapophyses of the
distal caudal vertebrae (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>). <br>
(after Longrich, 2008) relatively straight ventral edge of the maxilla
(unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>); an orbital rim on the frontal that is
relatively straight in dorsal view (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
dorsally convex distal caudal centra (in posterior view) (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
distal caudal neural spines not in trough on neural arch (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
slender distal caudal neural arch placed anteriorly (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
slender distal caudal prezygapophyses (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
pedal unguals narrow in ventral view (also in <i>Ornithomimus</i>);
ventral surface of pedal unguals weakly concave (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>);
one or both ventrolateral edges of pedal unguals sharp (unknown in <i>Anserimimus</i>).<br>
(proposed) differs from <i>Anserimimus</i> in - slender humerus
(proximal width &lt;20% of length) (also in <i>Sinornithomimus</i> and
<i>Gallimimus</i>); pubic boot &gt;40% of pubic length (also in <i>Struthiomimus</i>
and <i>Qiupalong</i>); pubic boot ventrally convex (also in <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
<i>Qiupalong</i>, <i>"Ornithomimus" seden</i>s and <i>"Gallimimus"</i>
"mongoliensis").<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Russell (1972) was the first to justify generic
separation of <i>Struthiomimus</i> from <i>Ornithomimus</i> on valid
morphological grounds, also moving two former species of <i>Struthiomimus</i>
(<i>S. brevetertius</i> and <i>S. samueli</i>) to a new genus - <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>.
<i>Dromiceiomimus</i> supposedly differed from <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus </i>in - humerus shorter than scapula; ulna ~70% femoral
length; preacetabular process, tibia, metatarsus and pedal digit III
longer compared to femur. Makovicky et al. (2004) stated there is no
statistical support for <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> using Russell's ratios
and synonymized <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> with <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i>, but did not go into details. The scapula and humerus
are only both known in three specimens (ROM 851 from the Horseshoe
Canyon and ROM 840 and TMP 1995.110.0001 from the Dinosaur Park), of
which the first has a scapula shorter than its humerus, and the latter
two have scapulae longer than their humeri. The first was referred to <i>edmontonicus</i>
by Russell and the second to <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>. This could just as
easily be attributed to <i>D. brevitertius</i> and <i>D. samueli</i>
as defined below, but is based on a very small sample size. No <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
(sensu Russell) specimen preserves the ulna and femur, and no specimen
is preserved with such an elongate ulna, the 71% ratio cited by Russell
resulting from assuming the estimated ulnohumeral ratio of ROM 840 is
present in AMNH 5201. But ROM 840 has a crushed radius and ulna which
makes measurements tentative and if we assume an ulnohumeral ratio more
like CMN 8632 and ROM 851 (which are from the same formation as AMNH
5201), we get a more reasonable 55-57%. Those specimens with preserved
ulnae and femora (ROM 851 from the Horseshoe Canyon and CMN 12441 and
TMP 1995.110.0001 from the Dinosaur Park) have lower and similar ratios
(47%, 50% and 51% respectively). AMNH 5201's ratio is still larger
because it has a longer humerus (75% of femoral length compared to 63%
in ROM 12441 and 65% in ROM 851). This may be diagnostic, but the
sample sizes are again small. Measured from the tip to the anterior
pubic peduncle edge, the preacetabular process of ROM 852 (22%)
actually seems shorter than that of ROM 851 (28%), the former being
referred to <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> by Russell and the latter to <i>edmontonicus</i>.
<i>Dromiceiomimus</i> specimen CMN 12228 has a ratio of 35%, and TMP
1995.110.0001's is 29%. So this does not support Russell's grouping. As
for the hindlimb proportions, only two specimens referred to <i>edmontonicus</i>
by Russell preserve tibiofemoral ratios (ROM 851 109% and CMN 12441
110%), which have smaller ratios than the six <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
specimens (119-136%). Only one specimen referred to <i>edmontonicus</i>
by Russell preserves the metatarsofemoral ratio (ROM 851 73%), which is
lower than five <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> specimens (74-85%). However, not
only is this very slightly lower than the lowest <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
ratio (in ROM 797), it also seems to be an allometric trend, as the
data points line up with larger specimens having comparatively longer
metatarsi. Further evidence against these ratios having taxonomic value
comes from newly discovered TMP 1995.110.0001, which has a tibia in the
<i>edmontonicus</i> range, but a metatarsus in the <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
range. Finally, only one specimen referred to <i>edmontonicus</i>
preserves pedal digit III (ROM 851 38% excluding the ungual), which is
indeed lower than the two <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> specimens (ROM 797 40%
and ROM 852 43%), but again not by much, and again it follows an
allometric trend. TMP 1995.110.0001 doesn't preserve pedal digit III,
unfortunately. In conclusion, scapulohumeral ratios are ambiguous, AMNH
5201 has a 10-12% longer humerus than two other specimens,
preacetabular lengths don't follow Russell's divisions, ROM 851 and CMN
12441 have tibiae 9-10% shorter than the shortest <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>,
and metatarsal and pedal lengths are allometric. One might argue that
despite the small sample sizes, the differences in humerus and tibia
length are expressed consistantly, but the specimen with the elongate
humerus plots between <i>edmontonicus</i> and other <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
in tibiofemoral ratio, so doesn't necessarily group with <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>.
Notably Russell also diagnosed <i>Ornithomimus</i> with several manual
characters and <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> with two caudal characters, but
the manus of <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> and tail of <i>Ornithomimus</i>
were poorly known at the time and new specimens like TMP 1995.110.0001
show both sets of characters (&lt;15 caudal vertebrae with transverse
processes; metacarpal I longer than II). This would all support
Makovicky et al.'s synonymization except that both he and Russell used <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i> as a stand in for <i>Ornithomimus</i>, but <i>O.
velox</i> is the type species of the genus. Russell only placed <i>edmontonicus</i>
in <i>Ornithomimus</i> because of its long metacarpal I, and Makovicky
et al. did not list any additional justification. Yet <i>O. velox</i>
does not clade with <i>brevitertius</i> (= <i>edmontonicus</i>) or <i>samueli</i>
in the only published matrix to test this (Hartman et al., 2019). For
instance, <i>O. velox</i> lacks appressed metacarpals II and III and
seems to have a medial distal condyle on metacarpal I positioned higher
than its lateral condyle, both less similar to <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
than <i>Anserimimus</i> is.<br>
Additional characters used by Russell to separate <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
and/or <i>edmontonicus</i> from <i>Struthiomimus</i> have a broader
distribution when examined in a cladistic context. The short manus
(&lt;107% of humeral length) is primitive for ornithomimids, also being
found in <i>Sinornithomimus</i>, <i>Anserimimus</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i>
and <i>"G."</i> "mongoliensis". The elongate metacarpal I is shared
with <i>Anserimimus</i>. The short manual unguals (III shorter than
phalanx III-3) are plesiomorphic, also found in <i>Sinornithomimus</i>,
"Grusimimus", <i>Harpymimus</i>, <i>Shenzhousaurus</i> and <i>Pelecanimimus</i>.
The subequally sized manual unguals I and II are also seen in many
other ornithomimosaurs (<i>Deinocheirus</i>, <i>Shenzhousaurus</i>, <i>Harpymimus</i>,
<i>Gallimimus</i>, <i>"G."</i> "mongoliensis" and <i>"Ornithomimus"
sedens</i>).<br>
Similarly, some characters used by Longrich (2008) to distinguish <i>edmontonicus</i>
and <i>samueli</i> from <i>Struthiomimus</i> are problematic. The
comparatively tall distal caudal centra (&gt;60% of width) are
plesiomorphic, being present in <i>Gallimimus</i> and <i>Sinornithomimus</i>
as well. The poorly developed posterodorsal process on pedal unguals is
also found in <i>Gallimimus</i>, <i>Ornithomimus velox</i>, <i>"O"
sedens</i> and <i>Archaeornithomimus</i>. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- humerus longer than scapula.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- AMNH 5201 was originally questionably referred to <i>Ornithomimus
velox</i> by Osborn (1916), though the humeri were illustrated as <i>Struthiomimus</i>
in his figure. The <i>brevitertius</i> holotype was discovered in 1924
and described by Parks in 1926 as a species of <i>Struthiomimus</i>
due to its preserved fifth metatarsal. Parks spelled his new species <i>brevetertius</i>
throughout the article, though Russell (1930) was the first of many
authors to spell it <i>brevitertius</i> instead. However, Sternberg
(1933) emended it to <i>brevitertius</i> because it is "evidently a
typographical error." As there is no proof of this in Parks' original
paper, and indeed he continues to use <i>brevetertius</i> in future
papers (e.g. Parks, 1933). This would make Sternberg's emendation
unjustified (ICZN Article 33.3.3), except that the spelling <i>brevitertius</i>
has become prevailing (10 vs. 2 citations on the Paleobiology Database;
16 vs. 5 on Google Scholar and 672 vs. 123 in Google) and is attributed
to the original author and date, which makes it a justified emendation
(ICZN Article 33.2.3.1). The holotype is unique among ornithomimids
(and seemingly abnormal among its species) in lacking the proximal
portion of metatarsal III, as in <i>Avimimus</i> and parvicursorines.
The holotype of <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</i> was discovered in
1916 and described by Sternberg in 1933. Its femur is here estimated as
~443 mm long based on a linear regression of <i>Ornithomimus</i>
metatarsofemoral ratios, and is also highly congruent with the linear
regression of digitofemoral and tibiofemoral ratios. Sternberg
distinguished it from the <i>O. brevitertius</i> holotype due to the
longer and narrower pubic boot, slightly different hindlimb proportions
(shorter tibiofemoral ratio, longer metatarsus and pes compared to
tibia), longer metatarsal II compared to IV (97% vs. 93%), and
proximally complete metatarsal III. Intermediates are now known for the
hindlimb and metatarsal ratios, while pubic boot shape seems to vary
quite a lot within <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>.  McFeeters et al.
(2017) figure the calcaneum.  The holotypes of <i>currellii</i>
and <i>ingens</i> were discovered in 1931 and described by Parks in
1933, again as <i>Struthiomimus</i> due to the preserved metatarsal V.
The <i>currellii</i> specimen is very complete though also quite
crushed, and was only distinguished from <i>brevitertius</i> due to
the divergent metatarsal II and slight proportional differences.
Watanabe et al. (2015) described its vertebral pneumaticity. The
holotype of <i>ingens</i> is far less complete and largely
distinguished from <i>currellii</i> by its larger size, comparatively
longer sacral five and shorter sacrals one and six, more robust and
comparatively longer hindlimb, straighter femur, more laterally twisted
metatarsal III, and slightly different hindlimb proportions. Sternberg
(1934) first synonymized <i>currellii</i> with <i>edmontonicus</i>.
Russell (1972) noted several new specimens and referred most specimens
(AMNH 5201, CMN 12068-12070, CMN 12228, ROM 797 and ROM 852) to his new
genus <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, sinking <i>ingens</i> into <i>brevitertius</i>.
The supposed differences are discussed above under the <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
comments. McFeeters et al. (2018) figure pedal unguals of CMN 8632,
12068 and 12069.  Discovered in 1967, Nicholls and Russell (1981)
included UA 16182 as <i>Ornithomimus</i>
in their table of proportions, but did not describe it. Britt (1993)
examined its sacrum, and it was described in detail by Macdonald and
Currie (2019).  Zelenitsky et al. (2012) described two new young
specimens (TMP 2009.110.0001 and 2008.070.0001) which preserve feather
impressions. Funston and Currie (2018) illustrate the distal
tibiotarsus of TMP 1983.127.0001, which they refer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus edmontonicus</span> and which
derives from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (TMP online catalog).<br>
Makovicky et al. (2004), Kobayashi et al. (2006) and Longrich (2008)
have synonymized <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> with <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i>, which seems correct (again, see <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
comments). These authors have all used <i>Ornithomimus edmontonicus</i>
for this species, but <i>brevitertius</i> was named seven years
earlier, and given the species' somewhat distant relationship to <i>Ornithomimus
velox</i>, <i>Dromiceiomimus brevitertius</i> should be the
combination which is used. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- differs from <i>D. brevitertius</i> in - humerus
shorter than scapula.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Lambe (1902) referred several isolated elements to his
new species <i>Ornithomimus altus</i>, but the distal caudal vertebra
in plate XV figure 1-2 may be <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> instead based on
its slender proportions. It would be <i>D. samueli</i> based on
stratigraphy. The holotype of <i>samueli</i> was discovered in 1926
and described by Parks (1928) as a new species of <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
since it preserved metatarsal V. Parks (1933) noted only minor
differences from the <i>currellii</i> holotype, including longer
dorsal premaxillary process, a posteroventral premaxillary process,
shorter anterodorsal nasal process, shorter posterior nasal process,
more robust ventral postorbital process, longer neck compared to skull
length (3.06 times skull length vs. 2.26 times), more robust cervical
ribs, and larger ulnohumeral ratio. It is not comparable to either the <i>brevitertius</i>
or <i>ingens</i> holotypes. Of the differences between <i>samueli</i>
and <i>currellii</i>, TMP 1995.110.0001 is like <i>samueli</i> in
having a posteroventral premaxillary process (also in <i>Struthiomimus</i>,
so perhaps hidden due to crushing in <i>currellii</i>), an
anterodorsal nasal process intermediate in length, a neck intermediate
in length (~2.7 times), and the rest of the characters are uncertain
from available illustrations. CMN 12441 has a short ulnohumeral ratio
like that of <i>currellii</i>. Russell (1972) described CMN 12441 as a
new specimen of <i>Ornithomimus</i> <i>edmontonicus</i>, and placed <i>samueli</i>
in his new genus <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> as <i>D. samueli</i> along
with the specimens he assigned to <i>D. brevitertius</i>. Unstated
pectoral and forelimb differences supposedly distinguished <i>samueli</i>
from <i>edmontonicus</i>, while unstated cranial similarities led
Russell to group it with <i>brevitertius</i> (based on CMN 12228). He
distinguished it from <i>brevitertius</i> due to the seemingly shorter
humerus, though his humeral estimate for <i>brevitertius</i> was made
by applying the humerofemoral ratio of AMNH 5021 to the
vertebral-hindlimb proportions of CMN 12228. This may be correct in the
sense that both the <i>samueli</i> holotype and probably TMP
1995.110.0001 have humeri shorter than their scapulae, while <i>currellii</i>
(here referred to <i>brevitertius</i>) has a humerus longer than its
scapula. But the seemingly unique forelimb proportions seen in other
individuals (long humerofemoral ratio in AMNH 5201; long ulnohumeral
ratio in ROM 840) make the <i>currellii</i> holotype's long humerus
questionably valid. He also noted the skull is more heavily constructed
than CMN 12228, though this may be due to ontogeny instead, as <i>samueli</i>'s
holotype is larger. He noted "no taxonomically significant
morphological differences" between CMN 12441 and his Horseshoe Canyon <i>edmontonicus</i>
specimens (CMN 8632 and ROM 851). Makovicky (1995) describes the
vertebrae of TMP 1993.062.0001 in depth (as cf. <i>Ornithomimus</i>).
TMP 1995.110.0001 is a nearly complete specimen found in 1995 and
mentioned several publications (e.g. Xu et al., 1999 supplementary
info), but not yet described except for its cranial pneumaticity
(Tahara and Larsson, 2011). Norell et al. (2001) illustrate the beak,
while Makovicky et al. (2004) illustrates the skull (as <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i>), and Cuff and Rayfield (2015) retrodeformed the skull
to study adductor musculature. Kobayashi (2004) illustrates the skull
and metacarpus and provides further morphological information on the
specimen. Based on the similarity of femoral and metatarsal
measurements to those listed in Kobayashi, the TMP <i>Ornithomimus</i>
specimen measured by Sereno et al. (1996) is TMP 1995.110.0001.
Zelenitsky et al. (2012) have recently interpreted black marks on the
radius and ulna which trend posterodistally to distally, and sometimes
are U- or hook-shaped as if they had hollow centers, as remains of
feather shafts. These may be remains of stage 1 quills instead, as they
are too basal to show remains of vanes. van der Reest et al. (2015,
2016) reported a new specimen (UALVP 52531) preserving an anterior
femoral skin web and body outline around the leg, as well as feathers
only on the proximal femur and dorsal tail, showing the distal hindlimb
and ventral tail were bare. The feathers are branched but lack
barbules, and distinct retrices although dorsal tail feathers are
longer than others. TMP 1981.022.0025 was included in Makovicky (1995)
as an undetermined ornithomimid. It may be <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> based
on the iliopubic ratio (found in Kobayashi, 2004), which would agree
with Makovicky's statement that it is probably congeneric with TMP
1993.062.0001. As it is from the Dinosaur Park Formation, it is here
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">D. samueli</span>. 
Britt (1993) examined the sacrum as well.  Zelenitsky et al.
(2012) note humerus TMP 2007.020.0004 has
posterodorsal features similar to quill knobs.  It is from
Dinosaur
Provincial Park (TMP online catalog).  Funston and Currie (2018)
illustrate a tibia (TMP 1994.012.1010) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>
sp., and the TMP online catalog indicates it is from the Dinosaur
Park Formation.  McFeeters et al. (2017) finds it to have a
notched lateral margin of the lateral condyle, a supposed autapomorphy
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Qiupalong</span>, but states
"most diagnostic ornithomimid skeletons from this formation have the
state of this character as either unpreserved, ambiguous due to the
quality of preservation or restoration, or inaccessible due to
articulation with the other elements of the hind limb" so that the
character's diagnostic value is uncertain.<br>
Makovicky et al. (2004), Kobayashi et al. (2006) and Longrich (2008)
have synonymized <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> with <i>edmontonicus</i>,
which seems correct (see <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> comments). While
Makovicky et al. and Kobayashi et al. sunk <i>samueli</i> into <i>edmontonicus</i>
(= <i>brevitertius</i>), Longrich questionably referred the <i>samueli</i>
holotype to "<i>Ornithomimus sp.</i>", an apparently valid though
undiagnosed species of <i>Ornithomimus</i>
from the Dinosaur Park Formation. He also referred TMP 1995.110.0001
and several isolated remains to this species. This is tentatively
accepted here, though the material will need to be studied to determine
if it should be synonymized with <i>D. brevitertius</i>. It should be
noted too that the Dinosaur Park <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> species must be
called <i>D. samueli</i>, and not <i>D. sp.</i>, as you cannot simply
drop a species name.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Bonaparte (1991) used the monotypic order
Alvarezsauria for his new genus <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>, but this has
been ignored by most subsequent authors. Livezey and Zusi (2007)
proposed Alvarezsauroidea for <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>, <i>Patagonykus</i>
and <i>Mononykus</i>,
but their classification is filled with many such redundant ranks. The
first authors to define Alvarezsauroidea were Hu et al. (2009) who used
a stem-based definition excluding both birds and ornithomimosaurs, but
not therizinosaurs.
Choiniere et al. (2010) later made another definition for the
superfamily, this time only excluding birds, so is troublesome if
alvarezsaurs are arctometatarsalians or sister to therizinosaurs.
Agnolin et al. (2012) tried to
reinstate Alvarezsauria using Choiniere et al.'s definition for
Alvarezsauroidea. While Alvarezsauria may be preferrable in that it has
the same suffix as most other large maniraptoriform clades and was
named over a decade earlier, Hu et al.'s definition is both earlier and
safer.  Hartman et al. (2019) recovered therizinosaurs as the
sister taxon to alvarezsaurs, as found in several other recent
analyses, so added <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
as an external specifier and changed <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>'
specifier to its type species.<br>

prominent proximal caudal infrapostzygapophyseal fossa; short and

Carotid processes aren't demonstrated to be present in the sixth

appears to be present on the only preserved postzygapophysis of
cervical four (figure 3b).  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 1987,
this was described as a new taxon by Averianov and Lopatin
(2021).  An element was described as a distal pubis, but is too
small to be this bone, and differs from theropod pubes in the
posteromedial flange and anteroposteriorly deep apron. 
Considering its size and shape, this is more likely to be a proximal
dorsal rib.  Averianov and Lopatin add the taxon to Choiniere's
coelurosaur matrix and recover it as an alvarezsauroid closer to
parvicursorines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertonykus</span>. 
When added to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis, it emerges as
an alvarezsauroid basal to Alvarezsauridae.<br>

<p><b>unnamed clade</b> (<i>Patagonykus puertai</i> + <i>Mononykus
olecranus</i>)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This group
corresponds to the standard Alvarezsauridae, but is more inclusive
after the analyses of Xu et al. (2018) and Hartman et al. (2019) where
patagonykines fall outside the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alvarezsaurus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>
clade.  All Late Cretaceous alvarezsauroid specimens are
provisionally placed here as all analyzed taxa from that time belong to
it.<br>
<b>Interrelationships</b>- The traditional topology was established by
Chiappe et al. (1996) and Novas (1996), where <span style="font-style: italic;">Alvarezsaurus</span> is sister
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagonykus</span> plus
parvicursorines.  This is also true in the
detailed alvarezsauroid analysis of Longrich and Currie (2009) and its
derivatives, as well as the theropod analysis of Choiniere et al.
(2010).  <br>
Alifanov and Barsbold's (2009) placed <i>Patagonykus</i> closer to <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>
than to parvicursorines, in the family Alvarezsauridae (with
parvicursorines being Parvicursoridae). Their reasons are flawed, as <i>Patagonykus</i>
has a supracetabular crest (which is primitive in any case), a large
pubic peduncle is primitive, the pubic foot and smaller manual ungual I
than phalanx I-1 are primitive and unknown in <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>,
while the large proximolateral process on manual phalanx I-1 is an
apomorphy of <i>Patagonykus</i> unknown in <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>. 
Note Choiniere et al. (2010) incorrectly shows this as their result in
Figure 3A, but actually recovered Patagonykus closer to parvicursorines
(Fig. S1b).  <br>
Agnolin et al. (2012) added several alvarezsauroids to Choiniere's
analysis and recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Alvarezsaurus</span>
closer to parvicursorines than to their newly established
patagonykines.  This is also true in Xu et al.'s (2018) more
recent version of that matrix with their new Early Cretaceous
alvarezsauroids added, and in Hartman et al.'s (2019) revision of the
TwiG matrix including all taxa.<br>
Hartman et al.'s matrix can recover a basal <span style="font-style: italic;">Alvarezsaurus</span>
in 3 steps and a basal Parvicursorinae in 4 steps, while Xu et al.'s
recover these in 5 and 7 steps respectively, and the most recent
version of Longrich and Currie's (Lu et al., 2018) recovers a basal <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagonykus</span>
and a basal Parvicursorinae in 3 steps each.  Thus none of the
options are strongly supported, but I use Hartman et al.'s topology
here.<br>

first proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagonykus puertai</span>
as a new taxon in an abstract, but this is invalid because it is not
"issued for the purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific
record" (ICZN Article 8.1.1, as defined in Recommendation 8G), and is
not "accompanied by a description or definition that states in words
characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon"
(13.1.1).  Although Novas (1997) originally argued PVPH 38 was too
small to belong
to the holotype, Longrich and Currie (2009) noted the neural canal is
similar in size and suggested it belongs to the same individual. 
Meso et al. (2018) identified cranial remains in the holotype material
and briefly described them.<br>
The referred specimen MCF-PVPH 102 "was not collected by professionals,
[so] no precise stratigraphic information is available; nonetheless,
only the Late Cretaceous Neuquen Group outcrops in this area" (Chiappe
and Coria, 2003).<br>

supposedly similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Loncosaurus</span>
but outside Euiguanodontia in their manually created cladogram. 
Agnolin et al. (2012) reported it "differs from ornithopods in lacking
a pendant fourth trochanter and a basitrochanteric fossa," but "is
reminiscent of the femur of <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagonykus</span>
in having a relatively well-developed and ridge-like fourth trochanter
and associated muscle scar" and "further resembles <span style="font-style: italic;">Bonapatenykus</span>in
having a very large and rugous proximal bulge for the m.
iliofemoralis externus." MGPIFD-GR 166 was one of numerous
fragmentary specimens described by Salgado et al. (2009) as
Alvarezsauridae gen. et sp. indet., consisting of "cuatro arcos
neurales cervicales posteriores incompletos, una vértebra caudal
prácticamente completa (sólo le falta el proceso transverso izquierdo),
sector proximal de pubis derecho, fragmentos de costillas e
indeterminados." MGPIFD-GR 194 is not included in Salgado et
al.'s materials list, but page 75 and figure 6 say it's a left pubis
fragment, and then later on page 75 it's listed as a pedal
ungual. It's unclear if this the same pubis fragment listed as
part of MGPIFD-GR 166, or if are there left and right fragments, and if
MGPIFD-GR 194 is a pubic fragment, a pedal ungual, or both. A
possibility followed here is that MGPIFD-GR 194 is a typo in Meso et
al.'s abstract when they actually meant the scapula MGPIFD-GR 184,
which Agnolin et al. said appeared to belong to the same individual as
MGPIFD-GR 166 and was "referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Bonapartenykus
ultimus</span>
on the basis of a very wide and deep notch on the caudal margin of the
scapular blade, and the coracoid in which the ventral portion is
strongly deflected medially and decorated with delicate but profuse
grooves."  Notably, Agnolin et al. list an incomplete coracoid as
being in 184 (or 166?) when one was never mentioned by Salgado et
al..  Agnolin et al. also suggested the pubic fragment "may belong
to the distal end of the bone. In fact, as occurs in the distal pubis
of the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Bonapartenykus</span>,
in MGPIFD-GR 166 the preserved portion of the pubis shows a
well-developed internal ridge that represents the reduced pubic apron
characteristic of the new genus."  Ultimately, exactly which
specimen Meso et al. meant with MGPIFD-GR 194 is not so important as
Meso (pers. comm., 3-2-2022) indicates "all the materials described by
Saledo et al. (2009) are now parts of MPCN-PV 738" and that additional
undescribed elements exist as well.  This will be detailed in his
PhD thesis later in 2022.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Alvarezsauridae defined</span>-
Sereno (online, 2005) revised his earlier (1999) definition for
Alvarezsauridae by adding non-ornithomimosaur external specifiers, a
very good choice considering alvarezsaurids may be basal maniraptorans,
sister to therizinosaurians, paravians or avialans. It appears to cover
all the published topologies, though the inclusion of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
seems superfluous, as it's never been placed more closely to
alvarezsaurids than at least one of the other external specifiers. Once
again though, Sereno didn't use an eponymous taxon - <i>Alvarezsaurus
calvoi</i> in this case. His rationale is that <i>Shuvuuia</i> is more
completely known and "clearly related", but if the relationship is so
clear, why not just use <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>? He stated "Well-known
(and/or more complete), nested specifiers are critical because they are
least likely to shift significantly in phylogenetic position", but if <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>
shifts outside Sereno's defined Alvarezsauridae (such as in Lu et al.,
2002), we'd have to redefine the family anyway. Choiniere et al. (2010)
were the first authors to define it using <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>
as an internal specifier, but used a node-based definition that
excludes some basal taxa.  In some recent analyses, this
definition excludes patagonykines as well.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ornithischian alvarezsaurids?</span>
Alifanov and Barsbold (2009) question the placement of alvarezsaurids
within Theropoda, but their reasoning is not cladistic, based largely
on autapomorphies (dorsal jugal process absent; dorsal quadratojugal
process absent; postorbital contacts quadrate; ventral flexure of
endocranium absent; posteroventral dentary process absent; fused
sternal plates; highly flattened metacarpal I; pubic symphysis absent),
characters absent in basal members (fused metacarpals; proximally
placed pubic tubercle; metatarsal III does not reach tarsus),
characters present in related theropods (enlarged prefrontal; dentary
teeth in common groove; procoelous caudal centra; obturator fenestra
absent in pubis), and characters unknown in alvarezsaurids (gastralia
absent; pentadactyl manus). Other theropods are known to have lost
dorsal jugal and quadratojugal processes, to have fused their sterna,
and lost their pubic symphyses as well, of course. The remaining
autapomorphies are unique among archosaurs as far as I know. The
authors state "it is interesting that many of the characters listed are
recorded in ornithischians", but while <i>Lesothosaurus</i> has
enlarged prefrontals (primitive for archosaurs), a flattened metacarpal
I and a proximally placed pubic tuber, the other characters listed and
present in alvarezsaurids are absent. The synapomorphies shared by
Theropoda and its subgroups are far more numerous, and any suggestion
for placing alvarezsaurids outside that clade can be ignored. <br>

proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Achillesaurus</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Averianov and
Sues (2022) list many characters typical of parvicursorines-
posterior dorsal vertebrae opisthocoelous; distal caudal vertebrae
procoelous; ulna with hypertrophied olecranon process; manual ungual I
with flexor sulcus; pubis with preacetabular tubercle (and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bonapartenykus</span>); arctometatarsalian
pes; metatarsal II with posterolateral flange.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The specimens were
discovered between 1977 and 1994, and between 1997 and 2006. 
While initially only identified as Alvarezsauridae indet., Averianov
and Sues
(2017) propose it "is possibly one of the most basal parvicursorines
[apparently using Xu et al.'s stem-based definition] based on its
relatively unmodified metacarpal III, which occupies about one third of
the width of the carpometacarpus, the less asymmetrical proximal
articular surface of manual phalanx II-1 and the absence of a dorsal
process, the presence of short ventral ridges on that phalanx, and the
laterally open ventral foramina on the ungual of manual digit
II."  Averianov and Sues (2022) describe this as a new taxon of
alvarezsaurid, based on additional postcranila elements and designating
the humerus as the holotype.  Note the article was first published
online on March 10 2022, despite the issue being listed as 2021. 
As with other Bissekty taxa, remains are
isolated so may represent more than one taxon.  In this case, each
referred ulna differs in that "The round facet for the aponeurosis
tubercle of the radius is clearly present in the mature specimen ZIN PH
2020/16 but is absent in the juvenile ZIN PH 2021/16", and manual
ungual I examples differ in that "In two specimens (ZIN PH 2445/16 and
2446/16), the collateral grooves are enclosed by notches whereas they
pass through ventral foramina on the third specimen (ZIN PH
2618/16)." 
While these could be individual variation, they could also indicate
different taxa.  Assuming one taxon, Averianov and Sues used
Choiniere's coelurosaur analysis to recover the Bissekty OTU in a large
polytomy with other parvicursorines, even when implied weighting was
used.<br>

Definition- (<i>Mononykus olecranus</i> + <i>Shuvuuia deserti</i>)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Sereno (online, 2005) claims his is the first
definition suggested for Mononykinae, but Chiappe et al. (1998) defined
it earlier as "the common ancestor of <i>Mononykus</i>, <i>Shuvuuia</i>,
and <i>Parvicursor</i>, plus all their descendants." Most 1990s
authors used Mononykinae for this clade, but according to ICZN rules it
should be called Parvicursorinae. All family level (-idae, -inae, etc.)
variations on a name are implicitly created by and credited to the
authors who erect one family level name for a taxon. Thus Karhu and
Rautian implicitly erected Parvicursorinae in 1996 when they named
Parvicursoridae, which gives it priority over Mononykinae that was
named in 1998. Hutchinson and Chiappe (1998) were the first to publish
the term Parvicursorinae, though they explicitly state they use
Mononykinae instead because Parvicursoridae was conceived by Karhu and
Rautian as excluding <i>Mononykus</i>, lacks a phylogenetic
definition, and was redundant in their paper with <i>Parvicursor</i>.
However, the ICZN doesn't consider these reasons valid. Another option
would be to use Sereno's definition for Mononykinae, which would then
exclude <i>Parvicursor</i> if Longrich and Currie's (2009) topology is
correct.<br>

indeed probably dromaeosaurid, and roughly similar to <i>Velociraptor</i>.
The phalanx is said to be broader than <i>Velociraptor</i>'s III-3 and
the illustrated ungual is clearly an alvarezsaurid manual ungual I
however. This makes Bohlin's material the first published alvarezsaurid

Material</b>- (IVPP V20341; Xiaoshalong) (adult) four anterior cervical
vertebrae (one incomplete, one partial, two fragmentary; 6.9 mm
excluding condyle), partial cervical centrum, partial cervical rib?,
incomplete proximal caudal vertebra (7.5 mm), two partial proximal
caudal vertebrae (7.3 mm), partial caudal centrum, ?scapular fragment,
distal pedal phalanx II-1, proximal phalanx II-2, fragmentary phalanx
II/III-?, incomplete phalanx III-2, fragmentary phalanx III-3,
incomplete phalanx IV-?, fragmentary phalanx ?IV-?<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Pittman et al., 2015) procoelous cervical
centra? (based on the convexity of two central rims, and a partial
centrum which might be oriented backward); large proximal caudal neural
canals. <br>
Differs from <i>Linhenykus</i> in- cervical diapophyseal ridges extend
to posteroventral rim of centrum instead of posterodorsal one; cervical
epipophyses absent; cervical centra with rounded ventral surface;
cervical centra not mediolaterally compressed (positional?); cervicals
lack carotid processes (positional?); cervical pleurocoels absent (also
in <i>Ceratonykus</i> and <i>Mononykus</i>); caudal transverse
processes originate from anterodorsal corner of centra instead of
posterior end of prezygapophyses; transverse processes deflect more
ventrally away from dorsal edge of posterior articular surface; chevron
articular facets absent; anterior portions of caudal centra have
lateral foramen.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Pittman et al. (2015; preprint 2014) describe this new
specimen as a parvicursorine that 'lacks' autapomorphies of other taxa
and differs from the contemporaneous <i>Linhenykus</i> in several
ways, though the latter differences are often considered to be
potentially caused by positional variation among known vertebrae.
However, some of these differences (cervical epipophyses absent;
cervical pleurocoels absent) are only known to vary with position in
the opposite direction, as IVPP V20341's cervicals are anterior and <i>Linhenykus</i>'
middle. Also, IVPP V20341 doesn't lack autapomorphies of e.g. <i>Xixianykus</i>,
<i>Parvicursor</i>, <i>Albinykus</i>, <i>Shuvuuia</i> and <i>Ceratonykus</i>,
it's too fragmentary to evaluate their autapomorphies' presence.<br>

short prezygapophyses, rod-like ischium and pubis, ilium elongate and
lacking cuppedicus fossa, reduced distal fibula, arctometatarsalian
foot, and fused metatarsals."  In fact, the rod-like pubis and
ischium, distally reduced fibula and arctometatarsus further indicate
this is a parvicursorine, while the fused metatarsals suggest
similarity with <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixianykus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Nemegtonykus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Albinykus</span> or

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Several characters previously thought to be

probably join the two as sister taxa.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1987, described briefly
by Perle et al. (1993a), then in more detail by Perle et al. (1994).
Perle et al. (1993a) originally named the genus <i>Mononychus</i>, but
this name is preoccupied by a curculionid beetle (Schuppel in Germar,
1824) so that Perle et al. (1993b) proposed the replacement <i>Mononykus</i>.<br>
Perle et al. (1993a) referred the Tugriken Shire specimen IGM 100/99 to
<i>Mononykus</i>, though they later (1994) expressed doubts about this
assignment. Chiappe et al. (1996) later referred Ukhaa Tolgod specimens
IGM 100/975, 100/977 and 100/1001 to <i>Mononykus</i> as well. These
and IGM 100/99 were all assigned to the new genus <i>Shuvuuia</i> by
Chiappe et al. (1998), while IGM 100/99 was reassigned to <i>Parvicursor</i>
sp. by Longrich and Currie (2009) (it is gien its own entry
here).  AMNH 6524 was stated to be a <i>Mononykus</i> specimen
found in 1922 in Bayn Dzak by Norell et al. (1993), but it is more

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Karhu and Rautian, 1996) strongly anteriorly
bowed femur (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span>).<br>
(after Chiappe et al., 2002) pedal digit IV less than 50% the length of
metatarsal IV (47%). <br>
(after Averianov and Lopatin, 2022a) differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span> by- lack of
longitudinal crest on dorsal surface of postacetabular process; lack of
fourth trochanter on femur.<br>
Differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Nemegtonykus</span> by-
lack of fourth trochanter on femur; entocondylar tuber of femur present.<br>
(after Averianov and Lopatin, 2022b; for <span style="font-style: italic;">Ondogurvel alifanovi</span>) metatarsals
II and IV fused over two thirds of their length.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Karhu and
Rautian (1996) listed a ventral crest "developed only on first sacral
vertebra", but this is based on the last sacral centrum (Averianov and
Lopatin, 2022a).  A sigmoid femur in side view is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span>, IGM 100/99, <span style="font-style: italic;">Linhenykus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixianykus</span>.  Metatarsal III
being "about one fourth" (24-26% of total metatarsus length is also
true in IGM 100/99 (27%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span>
(24%).  <br>
Contra Chiappe et al. (2002), the last dorsal vertebra is not
necessarily opisthocoelous, as the element described as the last dorsal
could have had a more anterior position.  They also state pedal
digit
IV being shorter than digit II is diagnostic, but it is actually 24%
longer than digit II.  <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was
discovered in 1992 and described in 1996 by Karhu and Rautian. Chiappe
et al. (2002) correctly noted that while the original description
claimed complete pelvic fusion, "the pubis and ischium of the only
known specimen are not connected to the iliac portion of the
acetabulum."  Alifanov (2012) suggested the opisthocoelous
supposed
last dorsal vertebra could be placed more anteriorly (thus allowing an
unpreserved biconvex last dorsal vertebra), and that the supposed first
sacral was actually the last.  Averianov and Lopatin (2022a)
redescribed the holotype and found that the supposed last three dorsal
vertebrae were actaully two non-sequential posterior dorsals (but not
including the last, which should be biconvex) plus "the centrum of a
sacral vertebra, incorrectly glued to a neural arch."  The centrum
"is
considered here that of an anterior sacral vertebra. This centrum is
incorrectly glued to the neural arch, which likely belongs to a sacral
vertebra."  The supposed first three sacral centra of the original
description were reidentified as the last sacral and two fused mid to
posterior sacrals.  Note the article was published on January 18
2022, despite the issue being dated 2021.<br>
Mirantsev reported an undescribed specimen at the PIN as well (DML
2004).<br>
PIN 5838/1 was found in 1999 and described by Averianov and Lopatin
(2022b) as a new taxon of parvicursorine <span style="font-style: italic;">Ondogurvel alifanovi</span>.  They
reported it differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>
"by the dorsally arcuate supraacetabular crest of the ilium, by the
tibia less curved labially in transverse plane, by less expanded
proximal part of the fibula, and by a relatively shorter pedal phalanx
II-1."  While these differences are real, the femur was said to be
"almost identical with the femur in <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>"
and the two emerge as sister taxa if entered into Hartman et al.'s
maniraptoromorph matrix.  As they are from the same formation and <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span> is a juvenile with a
tibia 62% of the size of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ondogurvel</span>,
it is hypothesized here that the taxa are synonymous and the shorter
pedal phalanx and fused metatarsus are ontogenetic differences while
the others could be individual variation (tibial curvature is known to
vary in <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>, for
instance).  Averianov and Lopatin added <span style="font-style: italic;">Ondogurvel</span> to a TWiG analysis and
used implied weighting to recover it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Albinykus</span>, but in their earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>
redescription noted this was done because equal weighting led to large
polytomies in Parvicursorinae.  Thus it does not strongly argue
against synonymy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>.<br>

Note Kubo et al. first say the specimen's cervical series is only
"missing ... [the] eighth or ninth cervical vertebra", but later state
"The missing cervical elements are the atlas, the eighth and tenth
cervical vertebra", which is correct.  Similarly, the materials
list
claims the holotype is "missing ... posterior dorsal vertebrae", but
the paper proposes nine dorsals were originally present and all are
accounted for.  In addition, while not mentioned in the materials
list, the holotype lacks a few distal caudal vertebrae proximal to the
pygostyle, all cervical ribs, most dorsal ribs, almost all chevrons,
right distal tarsals and both metatarsals V.  An element preserved
adjacent to right manual phalanx II-2 is labeled "Ulnare (?)" in Figure
11C, but no proximal carpals are mentioned in the text.  They
claim "the complete closure of the neurocentral suture in the cervical,
dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, fusion of sacral vertebrae, and
co-ossification between proximal tarsals and tibia suggest that the
individual was at least a late ontogenetic stage or close to maturity."<br>

?(IGM coll.) more than two specimens (Norell, 1997)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Chiappe et al., 1998) pubis subcircular in
section; femoral and tibiotarsal shefts bowed lateromedially; sharp
ridge on medial margin of distal tibiotarsus. <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Three characters used by Chiappe et al. (1998)
to diagnose <i>Shuvuuia</i> (articulation between the quadrate and
postorbital; elongated basipterygoid processes; hypertrophied
prefrontal) are now known in <i>Ceratonykus</i> too.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Chiappe et al. (1996) referred IGM 100/975, 100/977
and 100/1001 to <i>Mononykus</i>, briefly describing some aspects of
them. Norell (1997) stated over ten alvarezsaurid specimens have been
found in Ukhaa Tolgod. At least one is probably IGM 100/1126, which was
identified as <i>Shuvuuia</i> on the AMNH website but is actually an
undescribed troodontid, while another may be <i>Kol</i>. Chiappe et
al. (1998) named <i>Shuvuuia</i> and described the skull
preliminarily, with more detailed description of the holotype and
paratypes appearing in Chiappe et al. (2002). Schweitzer et al. (1999)
described feather fragments from IGM 100/977, while Dufeau (2002, 2003)
described the skulls of IGM 100/977 and 100/1001. <br>
IGM 100/99 (Chiappe et al., 1998, 2002) and MPD 100/120 (Suzuki et al.,
2001, 2002) were referred to <i>Shuvuuia</i>. However, Longrich and
Currie (2009) noted they differ from <i>Shuvuuia</i> and separated
them as the Tugriken Shireh taxon in their analysis.<br>
Mirantsev (DML 2004) reported two additional PIN specimens from the
Baruungoyot Formation "one with nearly complete posterior part of
skull, another with complete manus", which seems to be a reference to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span> holotype
found the year prior.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Found in 1992, IGM 100/99 was originally a paratype of
<i>Mononykus</i> (Perle et al., 1993), though Perle et al. (1994) first
expressed doubt about this assignment. Chiappe et al. (1998) made it a
paratype of <i>Shuvuuia</i>, describing it in more detail and
illustrating the sacrum, pelvis and fibula in Chiappe et al. (2002).<br>

Discovered in July 26 1998, MPD 100/120 was originally given the field
number 980726 TS-n Bird? SND and cited as <span style="font-style: italic;">"Shuvuuia</span> whole skeleton" by Suzuki
and Watabe (2000).  It was alater described as a <i>Shuvuuia</i>
specimen by Suzuki et al. (2001, 2002) who used it to show
parvicursorines had over thirty-five caudal vertebrae.<br>

Longrich and Currie (2009) noted both IGM 100/99 and MPD 100/120 differ
from <i>Shuvuuia</i>
in having a ventrally keeled first sacral centrum and/or metatarsal IV
longer than metatarsal II. Their small size, originally believed to be
caused by ontogeny, is probably an adult feature as various sutures are
fused. They separated them as the Tugriken Shireh alvarezsaur,
recovering them closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span> in their tree
and calling the taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor sp.</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype material was received by the YPM in 1887 and sent to the
USNM by 1908 (Gilmore, 1920).  It was said by Marsh (1892) to be
"various portions of the second, third, and fourth metatarsals", in
which "the distinctive feature is seen in the third which has the upper
part of the shaft so attenuated that it may not reach to the
tarsus."  If true, this would be the first report of a theropodan
hyperarctometatarsus, currently recognized in derived alvarezsaurids
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>.  Marsh
completes the only known description by stating "the second and fourth
metatarsals are very long and slender. This unique animal was about the
size of the common fowl."  According to Gilmore, the type material
could not be located in the USNM collections and is considered
lost.  Note while Marsh wrote <span style="font-style: italic;">O.
minutus</span> was "from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratops</span>
beds of Wyoming" and "in the same horizon" as <span style="font-style: italic;">"O." sedens</span>
(the Lance Formation of Wyoming), Lull (pers. comm. to Gilmore, 1908)
wrote it was in diamond number lot 1871, which Gilmore found via USNM
records was collected in Cretaceous beds of Colorado.  He listed
the locality as "Denver Basin, Colorado" and the horizon as "Denver
(?), Upper Cretaceous."<br>
Gilmore did report and describe one specimen at the USNM labeled by
Marsh as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus minutus</span>
Metatarsal (new) (Bird or <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>),
P. Qu. August 1-16, 1889-D. 2050."  This is USNM 2909, consisting
of a distal metatarsal II and two distal phalangeal fragments. 
Russell (1972) considered <i>"Ornithomimus" minutus</i> an
indeterminate dromaeosaurid or pterosaur, apparently based on Gilmore's
specimen as that work is cited.  Contrary to many websites
however, he did not create the new cobmination <i>Dromaeosaurus minutus</i>.
This was instead first published by Olshevsky (1991), who later (2000)
used the combination <i>Troodon minutus</i> instead.  The
specimen is definitely from the Lance Formation of Wyoming and is
actually an enantiornithine (Chiappe and Walker, 2002).<br>
Holtz (1994) is the first author to publish on YPM 1049, a distal third
metatarsal from the Lance Formation of Wyoming.  Comparing its
hyperarctometatarsaly favorably to <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>,
it was stated to be the type specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus minutus</span>. 
Longrich and Currie (2009) include YPM 1049 as an OTU in their
alvarezsauroid analysis, finding it groups with <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertonykus</span>.  It is currently
photographed in the YPM online database, catalogd as a "cotype" (=
syntype) of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus minutus</span>. 
If Marsh was correct about the locality, this could be a syntype (or
only known specimen, as Marsh was known to exaggerate completeness of
his taxa) of <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ornithomimus" minutus</span>. 
Yet if Lull was correct about the type being from Colorado, this is not
part of that material as is from Wyoming and has diamond number 2042. It may be referrable to <em>Trierarchuncus</em>, as that taxon is now known from tyhe Lace Formation.<br>
A final specimen labeled <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus
minutus</span>
is USNM 8263, collected by Hatcher in 1890 from the Lance Formation of
Wyoming (USNM database).  Although labeled a metatarsal, it
instead seems to be  metacarpal I of an ornithomimosaur.  As <span style="font-style: italic;">"O." minutus</span> is an alvarezsaurid,
it cannot be properly referred.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Fowler et al., 2020) on the distal end of the radius there is a
wide notch formed between
the proximal extension of the aponeurosis tubercle and ulnar suture;
ventral sulcus of manual ungual I extends proximally to reach the
distal extent of the ventral foramina but does not extend between them;
deep lateral embayment of the ventral foramina such that they are
displaced strongly medially, where the width of the embayment is
&gt;10% of the total width of the ungual at that point; extensive
rugosity developed as spur-like projections over proximal end; weakly
rugose flexor tubercle; flexor tubercle formed into two small mounds;
slight (more than <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertonykus</span>,
but less than <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>)
lateral pinching of the proximal articular end, forming a very weak
butterfly shape.<br>
(after Hutchinson and Chiappe, 1998) ischium substantially reduced in
width compared to pubis.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>-
UCMP 154584 was discovered in July 1980 (although the UCMP online
catalog says 1983) and catalogd as "?Aves/Theropoda" until it was
identified by Hutchinson as an alvarezsaurid in 1996.  Hutchinson
and Chiappe (1998) described it as Mononykinae incertae sedis.  An
almost complete metatarsal III (UWGM coll?) was discovered in Summer
2000 and presented as an abstract and poster at SVP 2001 by Buckley and
Ott.  They referred it to Alvarezsauridae, noting the straight
lateral and medial margins and ventral keel distinguished it from <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>. 
Salgado et al. (2009) favorably compared some of their new Allen
Formation alvarezsaurid caudals to a new specimen, stating "in the
middle of the vertebral centrum, those [ventral] ridges closely
approach to almost contact, leaving a groove between them, as seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span>
and in an unpublished specimen from the Hell Creek Formation of the
United States (LACM 153311)" (translated).  The LACM online
collections fully illustrate the specimen as Alvarezsauridae, revealing
it to be an incomplete proximal element found in 2007.  Notably
the LACM online collections also includes two Hell Creek alvarezsaurid
unguals (LACM 45796 and 45862) found in 1968 and 1969 respectively that
have not been published on yet.  Anduza et al. (2013) first
reported "a metatarsal III (Museum of the Rockies specimen MOR 2920)"
found in 2000 in an SVP abstract, described by Fowler et al. (2020) as
a parvicursorine.  Note this is not the same specimen presented by
Buckley and Ott, being less complete and from the opposite side of the
body.  Andeza et al. also mentioned "two unassociated manual
unguals from digit I (MOR 3098, 6622)" found in 2010 and 2006
respectively, which differed in size and a number of anatomical
characters.  At the time they stated "morphological differences
between MOR 6622 and 3098 most likely represent either variation
(allometric or ontogenetic) within the same taxon, or taxonomic
distinction."  Finally, Fowler et al. described these unguals,
manual ungual I BDM 001 and radius BDM 002, both found in 2015. 
They made MOR 6622 the holotype of a new taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Trierarchuncus
prairiensis</span>, referring BDM 001 based on shared characters, and
tentatively the other specimens and UCMP 154584 based on
stratigraphy.  This is extended to the Hell Creek specimens not
mentioned by Fowler et al. here.  By 2019, Fowler et al. had
settled on ungual differences being ontogenetic, as the largest and
smallest unguals were found very close by stratigraphically and "the
differences observed between the specimens described here are
consistent with what would be expected during ontogeny, i.e. the
smallest specimen has the least developed features (most of which might
also be considered as more basal states)."  <br>
Discovered in 1889 and identified as alvarezsaurid by Longrich in 2006, manual ungual YPM 56916 was referred to <em>Trierarchuncus</em> by Brownstein (2024) based on several diagnostic characters. Pedal unguals YPM 57236 (identified as alvarezsaurid by Longrich in 2007) and 57402 (found in April 1890; contra Brownstein who wrote 1889) were also preliminarily referred to <em>Trierarchuncus</em> by Brownstein.&nbsp; Longrich had identified YPM 57402 as an enantiornithine, but Brownstein's listed characters clearly place it in Alvarezsauridae and differ from e.g. <em>Mirarce</em> - &quot;paired lateral embayments on either side of the proximal end; slight curvature; absence of a flexor tubercle; a developed proximal lip and deepened nutrient grooves on either side of the ungual that suddenly direct ventrally at the proximal end.&quot;<br>
Fowler et al. added a <span style="font-style: italic;">Trierarchuncus</span>
composite (including BDM 002, MOR 2920 and UCMP 154584) to Choiniere's
coelurosaur analysis and recovered it in a polytomy with taxa closer to
Parvicursorinae than <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertonykus</span>. 
Freimuth and Wilson (2021) described two new manual unguals I, MOR
10889 found in 2005 and DDM 1682.32.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was originally referred to the <i>Elopteryx</i>
holotype individual (Andrews, 1913), then considered a pelecaniform.
Lambrecht (1929) referred NHMUK A1528 to <i>Elopteryx</i> as well.
Harrison and Walker (1975) later separated the material and named <i>Heptasteornis</i>
as a new taxon of strigiform based on two distal tibiotarsi. Later
authors agreed <i>Heptasteornis</i> was a non-avian theropod,
beginning with Brodkorb (1978).  Glut (1982) notes Brett-Surman
proposed it was non-avian
at the 1978 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, "an opinion
supported by Dr. Storrs Olson and Dr. R. T. Bakker."  Martin
(1983) suggested it was ornithomimid. Paul (1988) and Osmólska and
Barsbold (1990) suggested it was troodontid, Paul going so far as to
synonymize it with <i>Troodon</i>. Le Loeuff et al. (1992) suggested
it was synonymous with <i>Elopteryx</i>, which they placed in the
Dromaeosauridae. Csiki and Grigorescu (1998) suggested it was
synonymous with <i>Bradycneme</i>, which they believed to be a
non-maniraptoran tetanurine. Martin (1997) was the first to suggest a
relationship with <i>Mononykus</i>, which was confirmed in a paper by
Naish and Dyke (2004). This is based primarily on the notched medial
margin of the astragalar ascending process. They placed it in
Mononykinae (=Parvicursorinae) based on the lack of fibular-tarsal
contact (which also contradicts an ornithomimid or dromaeosaurid
identity). Longrich and Currie (2009) later stated <i>Heptasteornis</i>
"could conceivably come from an oviraptorosaur", but without any
reason. The only oviraptorosaur that lacks fibular-calcaneal contact is
<i>Avimimus</i>, which doesn't have the notched ascending process of <i>Heptasteornis</i>
and alvarezsaurids. Thus assigning <i>Heptasteornis</i> to
Oviraptorosauria is unparsimonious given current information. Hartman
et al. (2019) were the first to test this in an analysis, recovering it
as an alvarezsaurid closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Linhenykus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Xixianykus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Albinykus</span>.  Only a single step
moves it to Troodontidae, and 3 steps move it to Dromaeosauridae.<br>
Kessler et al. (2005) described a distal femur which they referred to <i>Elopteryx</i>
based on surface texture. The femur shares many characters with
alvarezsaurids (lateral condyle projected distal to the medial one;
prominent ectepicondyle), <i>Mononykus</i>+<i>Shuvuuia</i>
(infrapopliteal bridge) and <i>Mononykus</i> (triangular shape of the
popliteal fossa, bordered by proximally converging supracondylar
ridges). The last character is unknown in <i>Shuvuuia</i>, but the
infrapoplitteal bridge is absent in <i>Parvicursor</i>. Thus I refer
this distal femur to <i>Heptasteornis</i>, as <i>Elopteryx</i> is
unlike alvarezsaurids in some features.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Agnolin et al. (2012) added several alvarezsaurids to
Choiniere's coelurosaur analysis and recovered a trichotomy of <i>Albinykus</i>,
<i>Ceratonykus</i> and <i>Xixianykus</i>, sister to Parvicursorinae.
They named this clade Ceratonykini and gave it a node-based definition.
A pairing of <span style="font-style: italic;">Albinykus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixianykus</span> has since been found by
Xu et al. (2018) and Hartman et al. (2019), but Xu et al. place <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span> closer to
parvicursorines, while Hartman et al. found it more basal than either,
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Qiupanykus</span>which
neither of the other studies used.  An updated version of Hartman
et al.'s analysis recovers a Ceratonykini within Parvicursorinae, but
also including <span style="font-style: italic;">Linhenykus</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Nemegtonykus</span>.  Agnolin et

? (uncollected?) elements (Watabe, Suzuki, Tsogtbaatar, Tsubamoto and
Saneyoshi, 2010)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Alifanov and Barsbold, 2009b) shorter
supratemporal fenestrae than <i>Shuvuuia</i> (~27% of frontal length
compared to 33%); more elongate frontals than <i>Shuvuuia</i> (~30% of
length vs. 50%); prefrontals contact on median; basipterygoid processes
two-thirds as high as quadrates; fossa anterior to external mandibular
fenestra on dentary; external mandibular fenestra anteriorly rounded;
transversely narrow proximal caudal centra; femora strongly curved in
lateral view; elongate tibiotarsus (almost twice as long as femora);
cnemial crest reduced distally; elongate metatarsus (~1.33 times
femoral length).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Alifanov and Barsbold (2009b) also listed many
other characters in their diagnosis which are problematic. <i>Shuvuuia</i>
also has a long snout, while the anteriorly tapering frontals are
probably plesiomorphic. <i>Mononykus</i> and IGM 100/977 have a notch
between the deltopectoral crest and humeral head. The elongate,
distally narrow and symmetrical manual phalanx I-1 is probably
plesiomorphic, being shared with <i>Patagonykus</i>. The supposed
dorsal anteromedial crest on the postacetabular fragment is probably
the brevis fossa, as in other alvarezsaurids. The fourth trochanter is
plesiomorphic, being present in other alvarezsaurids except for <i>Parvicursor
remotus</i>. The ascending process is said to be equally broad and tall
as <i>Mononykus</i>'. The third metatarsal is comparable in length to <i>Parvicursor</i>'s
(~28% of side metatarsals). All arctometatarsal alvarezsaurids have
dorsally and ventrally grooved articulations between metatarsals II and
IV proximally. The proximal notch between metatarsals II and IV is seen
in <i>Mononykus</i> as well. The second metatarsal is also shorter
than the fourth in <i>Parvicursor</i>. The ratio between pedal
phalanges II-1 and IV-1 is merely estimated based on IV-2 length, and
is the same as in <i>Mononykus</i> in any case. While most of the
diagnostic features are unknown in <i>Mononykus</i> (except the three
femoral and tibiotarsal characters), the broader vertebral centra, more
obtuse sternal keel angle, seemingly narrower metacarpal I, different
phalanx I-1 morphology, less compressed tibiotarsal shaft and more
elongate pedal phalanges also help distinguish the taxon.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 2003, Alifanov and Barsbold (2009a,b)
placed this taxon sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>
in Parvicursorinae, though without using a quantitative analysis. 
Averianov and Lopatin (2022) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span> sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>
using a TWiG matrix, but only when analyzed with implied
weighting.  They stated "differences between these taxa are
minimal and concern characters that might be liable to ontogenetic
and/or individual variation. Consequently, it is possible that these
taxa could be synonyms."  Both are from the Baruungoyot Formation
as well, and one of their stated differences is the ilial ridge which
would be nullified if it is actually a brevis ridge as proposed
here.  However, they fall out four nodes apart in an improved
version of Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis (with updated <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span> scores, etc.) and
require three steps to unite, so this is not followed here.<br>
Discovered on September 11 1993, 930921 KmT was reported as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span> complete skeleton without
skull", but this is more likely to be <i>Ceratonykus </i>based on
provenence. It is photographed in situ as "skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>-like small-sized theropod
from the Red Bed horizon in Khermeen Tsav."<br>
Watabe et al. (2010) report "isolated bones a small theropod (probably
alvarezsaurid)" from the Red Beds of Khermeen Tsav found in 2006, which
would again match the provenece of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratonykus</span>. 
Both of these specimens could also be <span style="font-style: italic;">Parvicursor</span>
as well, which is known from other localities in the same formation.<br>
Alifanov and Barsbold identify an irregular element (or complex of
elements?) as a right carpometacarpus, with two conical processes
identified as fused unguals. Yet the fragment doesn't resemble a
metacarpus, and if it were, the spikes would project ventrally unlike
digits (as they are perpendicular to the flattest axis of the complex).
They would be more easily homologized with the ventrally dipping
lateral metacarpals of <i>Mononykus</i>, or the proximoventral
processes on <i>Patagonykus</i>' phalanx I-1.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 2011) longitudinal ventral furrow
along the entire length of each cervical centrum; cervical diapophyseal
ridges extend to the posterodorsal rim of the centrum; extremely weak,
ridge-like middle cervical epipophyses; large middorsal pleurocoels;
proximalmost caudal centra amphiplatyan; proximalmost caudal neural
spines located completely posterior to the neural pedicles;
transversely compressed metacarpal II without distal articular surface.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Linhenykus</i>
was discovered in 2008, preliminarily described in 2011, then described
in depth in 2013. Note the manuscript of Xu et al. (2013) was available
online on December 13 2011 and differs in the title and other details
from the final version.  The referred specimen was discovered in
June 2009 and described by Hone et al. (2013).<br>
Adding this to Longrich and Currie's
alvarezsauroid matrix, Xu et al. (2011, 2013) found <i>Linhenykus</i>
to be phylogenetically between <i>Patagonykus</i> and <i>Albertonykus</i>+<i>Xixianykus</i>+Parvicursorinae. 
Xu et al. (2018) and Hartman et al. (2019) instead recovered it closer
to parvicursorines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertonykus</span>,
closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixianykus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Albinykus</span> in the latter's trees.<br>
