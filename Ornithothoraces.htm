<b>Comments</b>- The type material was discovered in 1997 and first
announced by Bell et al. (2008) as "a new taxon of primitive
ornithuromorph bird." Bell et al. (2010) later described and named the
material <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollanda luceria</span>,
though their Table 1 lists it as <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollandornis
birdus</span>, clearly a typo.  The authors recovered it as a
basal ornithuromorph, either intermediate between <i>Patagopteryx</i>
and songlingornithids or sister to Ornithurae. However, when included
in a larger analysis with a greater variety of taxa, <i>Hollanda</i>
emerges as a non-ornithuromorph ornithothoracine. Characters more
primitive than ornithuromorphs include a lack of distal metatarsal
fusion and proximal tarsometatarsal foramina absent, while characters
shared with some enantiornithines include the posteriorly projected
laterodistal femoral margin, and metatarsal IV reduced in width.<br>

when those characters (identified from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mengciusornis</span> analysis this was

can equally easily fall out as an enantiornithine or a neognath, and
with a single extra step can be sister to all other euornithines with a
plantarily displaced third metatarsal.  Because of this it is
placed as Ornithothoraces incertae sedis here.<br>

<i><b>L. bretincola</b></i> Chiappe, 1993<br>
<b>Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Lecho Formation, Salta, Argentina</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (PVL-4021) (~575 mm) tibiotarsus (156 mm), incomplete
tarsometatarsus <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Chiappe, 1993) tibiotarsus transversely wider
than deep in proximal view; distal tibiotarsal condyles strongly
projected anteriorly; slender tarsometatarsus (also in <i>Hollanda</i>
and <i>Neuquenornis</i>); m. tibialis cranialis tubercle on metatarsal
II circular; proximoplantar surface of metatarsal II forming prominent,
thick edge (also in <i>Hollanda</i>); hypotarsus present and mostly
developed on metatarsal II.<br>
(proposed) plantar surface of tarsometatarsus excavated (also in <i>Confuciusornis</i>
and <i>Hollanda</i>); m. tibialis cranialis tubercle on metatarsal II
proximally placed (distance from proximal edge of tubercle to proximal
edge of tarsometatarsus &lt;60% transverse width of proximal
tarsometatarsus).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Lectavis</i> was originally identified as an
enantiornithine (Walker, 1981; Chiappe, 1991) and was labeled Type-B by
Chiappe (1992) before being named and described in 1993. It was
illustrated in more detail by Chiappe and Walker (2002). Chiappe (1992)
included <i>Lectavis</i> in a small phylogenetic analysis where it
emerged as a non-avisaurid enantiornithine. Yet the three characters
which placed it in Enantiornithes are now known in more basal taxa as
well- plantar surface of tarsometatarsus excavated (<i>Confuciusornis</i>,
<i>Patagopteryx</i>); m. tibialis cranialis tubercle on metatarsal II (<i>Confuciusornis</i>,
<i>Longicrusavis</i> and many other euornithines); metatarsal IV
reduced in width (<i>Zhongjianornis</i>). Kurochkin (1996) included <i>Lectavis</i>
in his Alexornithiformes incertae sedis based on its enlarged medial
tibiotarsal condyle, m. tibialis cranialis tubercle on metatarsal II,
and tarsometatarsal trochlea which differ in size. Yet Kurochkin's
taxonomic scheme is flawed, as his euornithiforms <i>Boluochia</i>, <i>Sinornis</i>
and <i>Concornis</i> have enlarged medial condyles as well, none of
his euornithiforms are known to lack the metatarsal II tubercle, and
his euornithiforms <i>Iberomesornis</i>, <i>Boluochia</i>, <i>Sinornis</i>
and <i>Concornis</i> have enlarged metatarsal II trochlea. In 
Hartman et al.'s (2019) maniraptoromorph analysis, it falls out sister
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollanda</span> within
Enantiornithes, which it is likely from since all other bird remains at
El Brete belong to that clade. Walker et al. (2007) incorrectly
(mistakenly) assigned the holotype to <i>Avisaurus</i>, while Walker
and Dyke (2009) indicate size and associations indicate it is probably
a junior synonym of <i>Enantiornis</i>.<br>

= <i>Ichthyornis maltshevskyi</i> Nessov, 1986<br>
<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan<br>
Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 3434) (~330 mm) anterior synsacrum (~39 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Kurochkin (1996) removed <i>maltshevskyi</i> from <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and placed it in a new genus, which seems correct as <i>Lenesornis</i>
differs in having broader anterior sacral centra which are ventrally
grooved, a lower anterior articular surface, and a fourth sacral
transverse process which is not short and dorsally directed. The latter
character excludes it from Carinatae sensu Cracraft. Kurochkin noted <i>Lenesornis</i>
is very similar to <i>Gobipteryx</i>, only differing in being less
concave ventrally and having a broader anterior articular surface
(height 73% of width instead of ~82%). <i>Gargantuavis</i> shares
broad and low centra with a ventral groove and transverse processes
which are similar where known, but differs in that it is very decurved
anteriorly, lacks pleurocoels, has a smaller neural canal, and has a
ventral keel on the first several vertebrae. <i>Noguerornis</i>
differs in having amphiplatyan centra, while <i>Iberomesornis</i> has
broader anterior sacral centra with a ventral median prominence. <i>Hebeiornis</i>'
sacrum is poorly preserved, but shares the ventral groove with <i>Gobipteryx</i>,
<i>Pengornis</i>, <i>Enantiornis</i> and <i>Lenesornis</i>. The sacra
of <i>Zhyraornis</i> and the Lecho enantiornithine PVL-4041-4 differ
in having narrower anterior sacral centra without ventral grooves. <i>Patagopteryx</i>
is similar in having a ventral sulcus, broad anterior surface and
slight ventral concavity, though the centra appear broader compared to
their length. <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i> also have
broadly similar sacra in relative centrum width and at least <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>
seems to have a ventral sulcus, though further details in either genus
are unknown. Hesperornithines and neornithines differ in having a
heterocoelous anterior articulation, while hesperornithines also differ
in being non-pneumatic. Both <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Guildavis</i> have
narrower centra without a ventral sulcus. <i>Confuciusornis</i> lacks
a ventral sulcus anteriorly, though confuciusornithids do share a
relatively broad sacrum with concave anterior articulation with <i>Lenesornis</i>.
The third sacral rib is larger than in <i>Sapeornis</i> or <i>Shenzhouraptor</i>,
though sacra of those taxa are only available in dorsal view, limiting
comparisons. Non-avialans have less extensively fused sacra, especially
at such small sizes. An exception is <i>Avimimus</i>, which is similar
in having a lateral fossa in the first centrum and a ventral sulcus
starting on the second centrum.<br>
In conclusion, <i>Lenesornis</i> is most similar to some
enantiornithines and basal euornithine, but is not an ornithurine, and
is probably closer to <i>Passer</i> than to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.
However, comparisons with non-ornithothoracine birds are limited and
the possibility <i>Lenesornis</i> is a very small and highly fused
non-bird maniraptoriform like <i>Avimimus</i> cannot be excluded.
Though it is distinguishable from other well described theropod sacra
(contra O'Connor, 2009), most are too poorly preserved or described.<br>

<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous <br>
Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan<br>
Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 4601) (~150 mm) mid synsacrum (~18 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- sacral pleurocoels present in midsacral vertebrae;
sacral pleurocoels directed strongly ventrally; sacral pleurocoels very
dorsoventrally compressed; extremely deep median ventral sulcus on mid
sacrum (also in <i>Gobipteryx</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1992) included two additional characters in
his diagnosis, but dorsoventrally compressed sacral centra are common
in birds as are large neural canals.<br>
Mourer-Chauvire (1989) first announced the discovery of this specimen
in 1989 as "part of the strange flat sacrum of a small new bird." This
taxon is based only on the mid portion of a synsacrum, containing two
complete and two partial vertebrae. It was small, as the complete
vertebrae are 2.9 and 2.5 mm long each. The vertebrae are
dorsoventrally compressed (~64% as tall as wide) and elongate (1.18-1.4
times longer than maximum height). The preserved sequence is only very
slightly concave ventrally, and each centrum has a straight ventral
margin. The ventral surface features a narrow median sulcus, giving the
appearance to paired ridges. There is a low and deep pleurocoel in each
complete centrum which opens lateroventrally due to the especially
broad dorsal area. The neural canal is very wide, at least as broad as
the centra. <br>
Both Nessov (1992) and Kurochkin (2000) have assigned it to Aves <i>incertae
sedis</i> without comment. Indeed, the fused sacral vertebrae are too
small to derive from adult non-avialan theropods. Even tiny <i>Caenagnathasia</i>
and <i>Ceratonykus</i> would have had sacra three times larger, while <i>Microraptor</i>
and <i>Jinfengopteryx</i> were twice as large. The large neural canal,
dorsoventral compression and ventral groove are common in
maniraptoriforms, including many basal birds. Unfortunately, most
Mesozoic birds have poorly preserved sacra, and are often undescribed
or only visible in dorsal view. Those of <i>Confuciusornis</i> are
similar in having lateral fossae and a ventral groove, but the fossae
are limited anteriorly while the groove is limited posteriorly. <i>Zhyraornis</i>'
sacrum is more concave ventrally, has narrower centra and lacks a
groove. It does have pleurocoels anteriorly, but these differ in being
laterally directed. The Lecho Formation enantiornithine PVL-4041-4 and <i>Guildavis</i>
are also more slender ventrally with no groove, and if they have
pleurocoels, they are not directed lateroventrally. <i>Apatornis</i>'
sacrum is narrower, especially anteriorly, and lacks pleurocoels. <i>Gansus</i>'
sacrum is narrower and not grooved ventrally though it does seem to
have somewhat ventrally angled central fossae on the anterior centra. <i>Ichthyornis</i>'
sacrum has anterior centra which are too narrow, without a ventral
groove, and only the first sacral has a slight central fossa, which is
directed laterally. The posterior centra are broader with a slight
ventral groove, but lack pleurocoels. <i>Apsaravis</i> has a broad
sacrum, but lacks a ventral groove and pleurocoels. <i>Gargantuavis</i>
has a broad sacrum with a ventral keel on the posterior half, but lacks
pleurocoels. <i>Gobipteryx</i>'s and <i>Patagopteryx</i>'s sacra are
similarly low and broad ventrally with a median groove, but they don't
seem to have pleurocoels. <i>Lenesornis</i>' sacrum is similar in
being broad and only slightly concave ventrally with a ventral sulcus,
but the pleurocoels are limited anteriorly and laterally directed. The
ventral grooves of <i>Gargantuavis, Lenesornis</i> and <i>Patagopteryx</i>
seem far more shallow than that of <i>Platanavis</i>, while <i>Gobipteryx</i>'s
is comparably deep. Thus the closest similarity is with various
ornithothoracines, though its relationships cannot be determined
further given the fragmentary material and lack of many comparable
taxa. It may end up being synonymous with one of the Bissekty's
numerous enantiornithines, such as the comparably sized <i>Explorornis
nessovi</i> or <i>Incolornis silvae</i>. <br>

down feathers on the head are more beautifully decorated. <span style="font-style: italic;">Smallornis liaoningica</span> is a very
small arboreal bird."  <br>
The available image quality means that it can't be determined whether
this is an enantiornithine or euornithine, although the coracoid
structure shows it is ornithothoracine.  None of the listed
characters are diagnostic past Pennaraptora, but I expect enough is
preserved to make it valid compared to named Jehol taxa.  Until we
have a better scan of its skeleton, I'd say leave it as
Ornithurothoraces
incertae sedis.  It is a nomen nudum as there is no "explicit
fixation of a holotype, or syntypes" (ICZN Article 16.4.1).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Harrison and Walker (1973) initially described <i>Wyleyia</i>

Glut (1982) notes Brett-Surman proposed this was a non-avian dinosaur
at the 1978 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, "an opinion
supported by Dr. Storrs Olson and Dr. R. T. Bakker."  Harrison
(1991) referred it to Enantiornithes, while Kurochkin (1995) referred
it to Palaeognathae. Naish (2002) believed <i>Wyleyia</i> was a
non-enantiornithine bird, and later (2011) classified it as Maniraptora
indet.. Inclusion of <i>Wyleyia</i> in a TWG based matrix suggests it
is most likely an ornithothoracine. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- TsNIGRI 52/11915 is far more elongate than any
non-bird theropod, so may belong to a euornithine or specialized
enantiornithine.<br>
Zelenkov and Averianov (2011) determined ZIN PH 9/109 was different
than <i>Kuszholia</i>, <i>Zhyraornis</i>, <i>Platanavis</i>, and
unnamed posterior synsacrum ZIN PO 4826. They referred it to
Ornithothoraces.<br>
Nessov (1992a) illustrated distal humerus ZIN PO 3434c he questionably
referred to Alexornithiformes. The humerus does resemble
enantiornithines in having a strongly distally projected ventral
condyle, but this is seen in <i>Apsaravis</i> as well, leaving the
specimen referred to Ornithothoraces incertae sedis.<br>
ZIN PO 3434f was listed as Aves indet. by Nessov (1992a), but could
conceivably derive from a small non-avian coelurosaur as well.<br>
Nessov (1992a) noted a possibly ichthyornithiform mandible discovered
in 1989, which seems to be the partial dentary ZIN PO 4608 ascribed by
him later (1992b) to Ichthyornithiformes. The preserved portion differs
from <i>Ichthyornis</i> in being more slender and upcurved. It is not
troodontid because it lacks a lateral groove, and differs from that
family, Dromaeosauridae and Alvarezsauridae in having distinct alveoli.
It is here placed in Ornithothoraces incertae sedis (but is not part of
Aves), as no more basal toothed avialans are known to exist by the
Turonian.<br>
Nessov (1992a) noted teeth of small birds discovered in 1989, one of
which (ZIN PO 4610) was later illustrated by him (1992b) as possibly
being ichthyornithiform. Yet the tooth differs from <i>Ichthyornis</i>
is being straight, more slender, and having a basally expanded crown,
and being uncompressed labiolingually. Those features are more closely
approached by Dinosaur Park Formation teeth like RTMP 96.62.51, but it
is more compressed as well. Perhaps it is an anterior tooth. If it is
indeed a bird and not a mammal or crocodilian, it seems distinct from
other well described examples.<br>
Nessov (1992a) noted "part of a humerus of a medium-sized bird with
strange morphology (possibly a new group of Aves" discovered in 1989.
This is probably the distal humerus ZIN PO 4613 later (1992b) figured
by him as possibly enantiornithine. Indeed, the humerus resembles
enantiornithines in having a strongly distally projected ventral
condyle and transversely oriented dorsal condyle. Yet these are present
in <i>Apsaravis</i> as well, leaving the specimen referred to
Ornithothoraces incertae sedis.<br>
Nessov (1992a) noted a posterior bird mandible discovered in 1989,
which seems to be the one later figured by him as ZIN PO 4621 (Nessov,
1992b). It seems to be ornithothoracine based on the concave dorsal
surangular edge, but further comparison is necessary to determine its
precise relationships.<br>
ZIN PO 4821 was referred to Enantiornithes by Nessov and Panteleev
(1993), then later specifically to Alexornithiformes by Panteleyev
(1998). While the deep dorsal fossa is found in enantiornithines, it is
also present in <i>Apsaravis</i>, limiting identication of this
element to Ornithothoraces incertae sedis. <br>
Mourer-Chauvire (1989) noted an ichthyornithiform sacrum, and Nessov
(1992) mentioned a posterior synsacrum discovered in 1989, "possibly
with affinities to ichthyornithiformes." Besides the size, said to be
similar to a recent coromorant, no further details are known. It may
indeed by an ichthyornithine, but could also be a more basal
euornithine, an enantiornithine, or even a non-bird theropod.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- laterally compressed proximal coracoid (also in many
Neognathae; absent in <i>Catenoleimus</i>, <i>Explorornis nessovi</i>
and <i>Elsornis</i>); m. tibialis cranialis tubercle on
tarsometatarsus confined to metatarsal II (also in <i>Velociraptor</i>
and <i>Longicrusavis</i>; absent in <i>Vorona</i>, <i>Rapaxavis</i>
and <i>Yungavolucris</i>); metatarsal II trochlea transversely
expanded (also in <i>Falcarius</i>, some paravians and <i>Zhongjianornis</i>;
absent in <i>Alethoalaornis</i>, Longipterygidae and
Liaoningornithidae); metatarsal IV reduced in width (also in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
and <i>Zhongjianornis</i>; absent in <i>Iberomesornis</i>, <i>Shanweiniao</i>
and Liaoningornithidae).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Wang et al. (2014) erected Pengornithidae to include <i>Pengornis</i>,
<i>Eopengornis</i> and IVPP V18632, as the most basal enantiornithines,
even moreso than <i>Protopteryx</i>. Yet their analysis was limited by
irrationally only including Jehol enantiornithines. Of their listed
characters for Pengornithidae, at least some are obviously primitive
(numerous small teeth in upper and lower jaws; no posteromedial sternal
processes; posteromedian process broad; fibula almost reaches proximal
tarsals), and Cau (online, 2014) found that when the non-Jehol
enantiornithines were re-included Pengornithidae was no longer such an
exclusive clade.<br>
Voronidae was named by Zelenkov in a Russian book chapter by Zelenkov
and Kurochkin (2015) as a family in his parvclass Vorones, also
including <span style="font-style: italic;">Mystiornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hollanda</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>,

1998<br>
<i><b>A. bonaparti</b></i> Panteleyev, 1998<br>
<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous <br>
Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan</b> <br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (TsNIGRI 56/11915) (~280 mm) coracoid shaft (~32 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Panteleyev, 1998) significant medial expansion
of distal coracoid; deep dorsal coracoid fossa (also in <i>Neuquenornis</i>
and <i>Enantiornis</i>); longitudinal groove along ventromedial edge
of shaft.<br>
(proposed) laterodistal edge angles medially.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Originally identified as Aves by Nessov and Borkin
(1983) and Nesov (1984), then as Enantiornithes by Nessov and Panteleev
(1993). Elzanowski (1995) believed the specimen was nearly identical to
<i>Gobipipus</i> (which he referred to juvenile <i>Gobipteryx</i>) and
referred it to Gobipterygidae and perhaps <i>Gobipteryx</i> itself.
However, it differs from <i>Gobipipus</i> in having the lateral edge
angle distomedially, a longer shaft between the dorsal fossa and head,
the supracoracoid foramen placed completely proximal to the dorsal
fossa, and a rounded proximal edge of the dorsal fossa. In addition to
these characters, it differs from adult <i>Gobipteryx</i> in having a
wider shaft, deeper dorsal fossa, more distomedial expansion and a
ventromedial groove. Kurochkin (1996) referred the coracoid to
Enantiornithidae indet., based on the deep and proximally extensive
dorsal fossa and convex lateral margin. The former is also found in his
alexornithid <i>Neuquenornis</i> however, while the latter is found in
his concornithids <i>Concornis</i> and <i>Cathayornis</i>. Panteleyev
(1998) described the specimen as the holotype of his new genus <i>Abavornis</i>,
which he placed in the Alexornithidae and Alexornithiformes without
comment. O'Connor (2009) declared all Bissekty enantiornithines based
on coracoids to be nomina dubia, though without detailed comparison.<br>

Nessov and Panteleev, 1993<br>
= <i>Explorornis walkeri</i> (Nessov and Panteleev, 1993) Panteleyev,
1998<br>
<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous <br>
Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan</b> <br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 4825) (~300 mm) proximal coracoid (~35 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) acrocoracoid process dorsoventrally deep
(&gt;50% as deep at level of junction between scapular facet and
acrocoracoid as the coracoid head is long); coracoid lateral convexity
begins on shaft proximal to dorsal fossa. <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Nessov and Panteleev (1993) distinguished <i>walkeri</i>
from <i>Enantiornis leali</i> based on several characters. The
coracoid process is not narrower however. The acrocoracoid process is
not actually shorter than in <i>Enantiornis</i>, but appears so due to
its depth. The proximal shaft is transversely wider, but this is
plesiomorphic. The elongate supracoracoid foramen seems to be the
medial exit, which is also elongate in <i>Enantiornis</i>.<br>
Kurochkin (2000) listed two features in his diagnosis to separate <i>walkeri</i>
from <i>leali</i>. The coracoid process is even more stout in <i>Explorornis</i>,
and equally so in <i>Incolornis</i>, <i>Neuquenornis</i> and <i>Catenoleimus</i>.
The proximal shaft is more gracile dorsoventrally, but this is also
true of <i>Gurilynia</i>, <i>Gobipteryx</i> and <i>Explorornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1991 and named <i>"Enantiornis"
walkeri</i> by Nessov and Panteleev (1993). While the quotation marks
suggest they did not believe the species to actually be <i>Enantiornis</i>,
they did place it within the Enantiornithiformes. Kurochkin (1996)
removed the quotation marks, as he believed it was referrable to <i>Enantiornis</i>
based on the obtuse acrocoracoid tip, stout coracoid process and
proximally (dorsoventrally?) thick shaft. However, the acrocoracoid tip
is no more obtuse than <i>Explorornis</i>, <i>Incolornis martini</i>
and <i>Alexornis</i>, the coracoid process is less stout in <i>Enantiornis</i>
than in <i>Explorornis</i>, <i>Incolornis</i>, <i>Catenoleimus</i>, <i>Otogornis</i>
or <i>Neuquenornis</i>, and the shaft isn't thick as in <i>Enantiornis</i>
and is much thinner than in <i>Incolornis</i>. Kurochkin (2000) later
kept the species in <i>Enantiornis</i> and added a couple coracoid
features to his diagnosis of the genus- short coracoid shaft; stout
acrocoracoid process. The former is plesiomorphic, while the latter is
also present in <i>Otogornis</i> and <i>Incolornis</i>. Panteleyev
(1998) transferred <i>walkeri</i> to his new genus <i>Explorornis</i>
(within Alexornithidae and Alexornithiformes) without justification,
though it does share that genus' primitive dorsoventrally compressed
coracoid shaft and shallow dorsal fossa. Yet it lacks the apomorphic
dorsolateral ridge of <i>Explorornis</i>. <i>walkeri</i> does not
seem to be definitively referrable to either genus. O'Connor (2009)
declared all Bissekty enantiornithines based on coracoids to be nomina
dubia, though without detailed comparison. <br>

proximally; tarsometatarsus plantarly excavated; metatarsal II trochlea
wide and angled so that lateral condyle extends farther than medial
condyle; medial condyle of metatarsal II trochlea strongly projected

well developed; tubercle on proximal dorsal surface of metatarsal III,
with another just distal to it on metatarsal II; plantar surface of

metatarsal IV with small, non-perforating, plantar foramina; metatarsal
IV trochlea non-ginglymous; metatarsal V present.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2007. Despite stating "<i>Evgenavis</i>
differs from <i>Confuciusornis</i> only in size and proportions, being
larger and more slender and waisted than the latter", O'Connor et al.
recovered it as an enantiornithine in their analysis (based on
O'Connor's matrix). They ended up merely placing it in Aves incertae
sedis. The fact that the four taxa this paper added to O'Connor's
matrix ended up in a clade together when implied weights were used
could suggest systematic coding errors/differences compared to
O'Connor's original taxa. As Cau (online, 2014) recovered <i>Evgenavis</i>
as an enantiornithine as well, it is tentatively placed in that clade
here.<br>

<p><i><b>Incolornis</b></i> Panteleyev, 1998<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) very deep coracoid shaft (&gt;40% of
proximodistal head length); proximodorsal bump located on shaft just
distal to scapular facet.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Panteleyev (1998) listed three diagnostic
characters for <i>Incolornis</i>. Of these, the ventral longitudinal
ridge on the coracoid shaft is also present in <i>Iberomesornis</i>, <i>Enantiornis</i>
and <i>Gobipteryx</i>. The narrow coracoid tubercle is found in a wide
range of taxa (e.g. <i>Catenoleimus</i>, <i>Elsornis</i>, <i>Gurilynia</i>,
<i>Enantiornis</i>, <i>Eocathayornis</i>, <i>Cathayornis</i>).
Finally, the supracoracoid foramen has its proximal exit on the middle
of the medial side of the shaft in <i>Enantiornis</i>, <i>Otogornis</i>
and <i>Neuquenornis</i> as well. O'Connor (2009) declared all Bissekty
enantiornithines based on coracoids to be nomina dubia, though without
detailed comparison.<br>

(proposed) proximodorsal coracoid bump placed further proximally than
in <i>I. silvae</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (1996) listed the narrow coracoid
tubercle as a diagnostic feature, but as noted in the genus diagnosis,
this is widespread in enantiornithines. He also listed the stout shaft,
which is covered in the genus diagnosis above.<br>
Panteleyev (1998) also distinguishes <i>I. martini</i> from <i>I.
silvae</i> based on the supposedly less transversely flattened coracoid
shaft, but this seems untrue as <i>I. martini</i> has a width/depth
ratio of 69% while <i>I. silvae</i>'s is 74%. His final character is
the larger groove between the glenoid and acrocoracoid in <i>I. martini</i>,
but this could be due to erosion in <i>I. silvae</i>'s holotype.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was discovered in 1989 and originally figured as
a scapula of Enantiornithidae indet. by Nessov (1992). It was later
described as "<i>Enantiornis" martini </i> by Nessov and Panteleev
(1993), which may indicate they did not feel it belonged in that genus.
Kurochkin (1996) believed it was <i>Enantiornis</i> based on the
obtuse acrocoracoid tip and stout coracoid process. However, the
acrocoracoid tip is no more obtuse than <i>Explorornis</i>, <i>walkeri,
</i> and <i>Alexornis</i>, and the coracoid process is less stout in <i>Enantiornis</i>
than in <i>Explorornis</i>, <i>Catenoleimus</i>, <i>Otogornis</i> or
<i>Neuquenornis</i>. Kurochkin (2000) later kept the species in <i>Enantiornis</i>
and added a couple coracoid features to his diagnosis of the genus-
short coracoid shaft; stout acrocoracoid process. The former is
plesiomorphic, while the latter is also present in <i>Otogornis</i>
and <i>walkeri</i>. Panteleev (1998) referred this species to his new
genus <i>Incolornis</i>, based on <i>I. silvae</i>, which seems
correct despite his listed diagnosis for the genus being problematic.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Zhang (2007) provided
this brief description (translated) - "The primitive bird whose
individual is smaller than the petite <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoxiornis</span>,
belongs to the Enantiornithes group. The head is short and round, the
skull is relatively developed, and the jaw has teeth. The outer body is
feathered, and the forelimbs have become wings. There are 3 curved
finger claws, which are relatively developed, the sternal keel is
prominent, the caudal vertebra have fused, and the tail is short. ...
This fossil is the smallest bird fossil discovered in the Late
Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of western Liaoning, China,
and it remains to be studied."  <br>
The generic assignment is odd because <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinzhouornis</span>
is a confuciusornithid, but this is stated to be an
enantiornithine.  That identification seems to be correct, given
the short fused premaxillae preserved left of the main skull, coracoid
and humeral shape, tiny diamond-shaped sternum, and manus with short
digit I and reduced ungual and seemingly long metacarpal III projecting
past II.  In addition to the sternal anatomy, the poorly ossified
ends of elements and stated small size strongly suggests a young
age.  The description seems inaccurate in that the round head is
probably due to beak elements overlapping the posterior cranium, the
manual unguals are not well developed or necessarily three in number,
and the sternum shows no sign of a keel.  The other details are
congruent with a juvenile enantiornithine, and this specimen is likely
indeterminate as are most other juvenile enantiornithines ( e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoxiornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dalingheornis</span>,
GMV-2158 and 2159).  It is a nomen nudum as there is no "explicit
fixation of a holotype, or syntypes" (ICZN Article 16.4.1).<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Stidham (1998) initially refers to &quot;one species of <em>Alexornis</em>&quot; (which is not YPM 57823 that was discovered 11 years later), but Stidham and Hutchison (2001) later say &quot;Additional currently indeterminate Hell Creek enantiornithine material (Stidham, 1998) may represent additional avisaurid material.&quot;<br>
Coracoid YPM 57823 was discovered on July 2 2009 and is identified in the YPM online catalog as Enantiornithinae.&nbsp; It differs from Hell Creek ?<em>Avisaurus</em> sp. YPM
57235 in having a neck with a subcircular section and a bulbous scapular facet with a slight notch in its medial surface.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- LH 11386 bird 3 is one of the two most fragmentary of
four juvenile birds found associated in a theropod or pterosaur pellet.
It was only identified as a bird by Sanz et al. (2001), and is the
specimen on the right which is colored black in their illustration. The
medial tibiotarsal condyle being wider than the lateral one is only
seen in <i>Patagopteryx</i> among euornithines. Also, the proximal end
of metatarsal III is in the same plane as metatarsals II and IV, which
is only seen in <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i>
among euornithines. Metatarsal IV being so narrow compared to II and
III is uniquely enantiornithine. Where exactly it fits among
Enantiornithes must await further description or better illustration.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These were described by Buffetaut (1998) as
enantiornithines and stated to resemble <i>Enantiornis</i> most
closely. Walker et al. (2007) noted they could be referrable to the
similarly sized <i>Martinavis</i> from the same strata, and described
more precise similarities between ACAP-M 192 and <i>Enantiornis</i>,
and ACAP-M 193 and unnamed Lecho Formation femora. Whether these
similarities (reduced acrocoracoid; robust coracoid head; supracoracoid
foramen does not open into dorsal fossa; well developed trochanteric
crest; deeply excavated proximolateral surface of femur) are
synapomorphic requires further study.<br>

<b>unnamed probable enantiornithine</b> (Nessov, 1988)<br>
<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
</b><b>Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (ZIN PO 3473) axis (13.5 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1988, 1992a) originally assigned this axis to
Aves, then later (1992b) stated it was similar to Gaviidae. Kurochkin
(1996) assigned it to Alexornithidae within Enantiornithines. This was
based on several characters- general elongation; poorly developed
prezgyapophyseal facets; lateral extensions of the prezgyapophyseal
facets; broad neural arch; dorsally flat posterior neural arch that is
projected posteriorly; low neural spine; shallow lateral central fossa.
These were compared favorably to <i>Gobipteryx</i> (his <i>Nanantius
valifanovi</i>) which he included in Alexornithidae, but it should be
noted how few enantiornithine axes are known and described. The axis of
<i>Hebeiornis</i> shares the poorly developed prezygapopgyses, lateral
prezgyapophyseal extensions and broad neural arch, though it is less
elongate and seemingly has a less posteriorly extensive neural arch.
That of LP-4450-IEI has the broad neural arch and low neural spine, but
is less elongate. Those of GMV-2158, <i>Eocathayornis</i> and <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
are much shorter, but cannot be compared otherwise. Additionally, many
of the characters have a broader distribution. Both <i>Confuciusornis</i>
and <i>Patagopteryx</i> have axes with low neural spnes and shallow
lateral fossae, for instance. It is tentatively retained here as an
enantiornithine closer to <i>Gobipteryx</i> than the other taxa
mentioned above based on elongation, but it should be compared to a
wider range of coelurosaurs as well.<br>

humeri, femora, tibiae and fibula were reidentified as the femora,
humeri, ulnae and radius respectively, and cervical vertebrae were
reidentified as dorsals. The supposed predentary may be the median area
of a furcula, the supposed qudrate may be correctly identified, and the
occiput may be that or a cervical neural arch. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Hou (1997) includes a photograph of an articulated
pelvis (IVPP coll.) which was illustrated as <i>Cathayornis yandica</i>
by Zhou (1999) and Zhou and Hou (2002) without comment. It has a highly
convex dorsal postacetabular margin and large amount of taper, unlike <i>Cathayornis</i>,
so is probably wrongly referred.<br>
Zhang et al. (2014) described a specimen they state is most similar to <i>Pengornis</i>
(large size; hooked acromion; large interclavicular angle;
forelimb/hindlimb ratio minus phalanges 1.32), but differs in-
posteromedial sternal processes; more robust ulna; longer hallux.<br>

(CAGS coll.) two specimens (Lamanna et al., 2009)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note Ji et al. (2011) later described the Xiagou <i>Qiliania</i>
as an enantiornithine, though it is placed more conservatively as
Pygostylia incertae sedis here. Given that it is based on two
specimens, this leaves six undescribed enantiornithines noted by
Lamanna et al. (2009) (out of their 11 total). The three numbered
specimens listed by O'Connor (2009) probably encompass the two
posterior skeletons (one including retrices, another including feathers
and pedal claw sheaths) mentioned by Lamanna et al. (2009). Indeed,
CAGS-IG-07-CM-001 can be inferred to be the specimen including retrices
by its mention and illustration in O'Connor et al. (2012), and its
measurements are listed in O'Connor et al. (2015). The other specimen
is confirmed to be CAGS-IG-05-CM-004 by O'Connor et al. (2015), who
described it as <i>Feitianius</i>. CAGS-IG-05-CM-030 being described
as <i>Dunhuangia</i> (Wang et al., 2015) further lowers the number of
unpublished specimens.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimaia</span>
was described based on IVPP 25371 with the paratype CAGS-IG-04-CM-007
orioginally being described without a name by Lammana et al. (2006).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Originally described in Japanese by Unwin and Matsuoka
(2000), who also figured the bone. Matsuoka et al. (2002) referred to
this as a bird based on its lack of torsion and Enantiornithes based on
the lack of an anteriorly bulbous head. However, the former is actually
present in most enantiornithines (with some exceptions like <i>Elsornis</i>,
<i>Neuquenornis</i> and <i>Enantiornis</i>) and the latter character
is symplesiomorphic for theropods. Unwin and Matsuoka's figure shows a
capital groove and concave proximal border to the humeral head though,
which agree with enantiornithine anatomy.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Li and Gao (2007) reported several enantiornithine
specimens are known from the Sinuijiu Series, two of which are
illustrated and commented on by Gao et al. (2009). The latter referred
the hindlimb specimen to Enantiornithes based on- unfused metatarsus;
metatarsal II much shorter than III or IV; metatarsals III and IV equal
in length. Yet these are primitive characters, and as the fourth
metatarsal isn't very reduced in width, this may be another kind of
bird such as a confuciusornithid. The large pedal ungual I indicates
this is probably an ornithine though. The second photographed specimen
isn't identified past being a bird, but while the long pygostyle
suggests it is enantiornithine or confuciusornithid, the large manual
ungual is more similar to the latter clade.<br>

DIP-V-15100 and 15101 were found in 2015 and consist of juvenile wings
(Xing et al., 2016).  "Preserved feather colour in DIP-V-15100
appears dark brown in the alula, and is slightly paler in the primaries
and secondaries ... Dorsal contour feathers are generally dark in
colour, but those basal to the alula may have been pale or white ...
Ventrally, the surface of the wing has a strong contrast between white
or pale contour feathers and down adjacent to the dark brown contour
feathers along the anterior margin of the wing."  "DIP-V-15101
shares a pale or white spot among the feathers just basal to its
well-developed alula ... better-defined bands of pale feathers extend
across the dorsal surface of DIP-V-15101, posteriorly and distally from
the apex of the alula, and along the trailing edge of the wing." 
On "the ventral wing surface ... the base of the alular digit is
clearly surrounded by white under marginal coverts (Fig. 3c), and this
plumage continues posteriorly, as a mixture of pale or white
plumulaceous feathers."  <br>
Xing et al. (2017) describe enantiornithine hatchling HPG-15-1
discovered by January 2017.  "Unfeathered regions ... include most
of the postauricular, auricular (anterior to the external ear opening),
malar, and submalar areas", while "the ventral surface of the manus
lacks plumage, and the exposed skin has a mottled grey, tan, and black
surface."  "The individual feathers in each [cervical] tract are
dark brown in color", "feathers from the lateral pectoral tract are ...
elongate, pale or
white contours", "plumage within the femoral and crural tracts ... are
nearly transparent, suggesting that they were pale or white" and
"interspersed among the neoptile [hindlimb] plumage are isolated
bristle-like filaments (IBFs) of a medium brown color." 
Considering wing and tail color, "each of the complete primaries is
preserved with visible color patterning that consists of a walnut brown
color interrupted by a pale feather apex and two pale transverse bands
in the distal half of the feather", "the central core and apical margin
of each secondary feather is preserved with a pale brown color, while
the lateral margins of each vane are preserved with amuch darker walnut
brown color", and "the lateral margins [of the tail] bear a row of
unpigmented (pale or white) feathers."<br>
Xing et al. (2018) describe poorly preserved specimen
DIP-V-15102.  "The barbule apices among the head feathers are
preserved with a diffuse, dark brown pigmentation, while the barbule
bases and barb rami appear to have been pale or unpigmented."  On
feathers which "presumably stem from the shoulder or breast regions"
pigmentation "is uniform across all feather regions, appearing pale
brown and diffuse."  In primary remiges "barbules, rami, and
rachises are all diffuse, pale brown in colour", while secondaries "may
have more of a reddish-brown apparent coloration."<br>
Xing et al. (2019a) describe enantiornithine pes and wing fragment
DIP-V-15105.  On the foot "contour feathers are preserved with a
dark brown overall colouration", while filaments between scutellae
"were either white or pale in life."  The pedal proportions are
different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Elektorornis</span>
or HPG-15-1, while there are ten primaries unlike DIP-V-15100 or 15101
which each have nine.  <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Schweitzer et al. (2001, 2002) referred this specimen to
Enantiornithes. The strut-like coracoid indicates these are avialan
eggs, while the large proximodorsal ischial process is similar to
non-euornithine avialans. The laterally excavated furcula is only
known in enantiornithines. The dorsally projected deltopectoral crest
is unlike Aves as well as most more basal euornithines (except
ambiortids, <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>). The slender radius
(compared to ulnar width) does not indicate bird affinities though, as
it is also found in many more basal maniraptorans. The specimens could
belong to the enantiornithine <i>Neuquenornis</i> from the same
locality. While the prismatic structure of the eggshell was noted as
being like neognaths, <i>Gobipipus</i> and troodontids are now known
to have a similar construction. The third structural layer is otherwise
unique to euornithines where definitely associated with skeletal
material however.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- A large amount of mostly disarticulated
enantiornithine specimens have been found in the Lecho Formation. Most
have been described and illustrated by Walker and Dyke (2009), though
some have only appeared as specimen numbers in Chiappe (1996). Seven
humeral morphologies are known from the site (<i>Enantiornis leali, E?
sp. nov., Martinavis? vincei, M? saltariensis, M? minor, M? whetstonei </i>and<i>
Elbretornis</i>), and three tarsometatarsal morphologies (<i>Lectavis</i>,
<i>Yungavolucris</i> and <i>Soroavisaurus</i>). These specimens
probably belong to those taxa, though determining their exact
allocation is difficult. Several specimens (PVL-4030-4032, 4034,
4036-4038, 4044, 4049, 4056, 4060 and 4273) were referred to <i>Martinavis
sp.</i> by Walker and Dyke, though none of the Lecho species are here
thought to belong to that genus. Still, these specimens are too small
to be <i>Enantiornis</i> or <i>Elbretornis</i>, and several (e.g.
PVL-4030, 4036, 4060) are so small they probably belong to <i>minor</i>
or <i>whetstonei</i>. <br>
PVL-4049 was originally illustrated by Walker (1981) then referred to <i>Enantiornis</i>
by Chiappe and Walker (2002). Walker and Dyke (2009) placed it in <i>Martinavis</i>
instead, as it is much smaller than <i>Enantiornis</i>.<br>
PVL-4036 was photographed by Chiappe (1996), PVL-4037 was illustrated
by Walker (1981) and Chiappe and Walker (2002), and PVL-4038 was first
noted by Chiappe and Calvo (1994) and photographed in Chiappe (1996; as
PVL-4048). Walker et al. (2007) stated PVL-4037 is consistant in size
with both <i>Enantiornis</i> and <i>Martinavis? vincei</i> from the
same locality, and Walker and Dyke (2009) referred all three specimens
to <i>Martinavis sp.</i>.<br>
The proximal end of PVL-4060 was illustrated schematically by Chiappe
and Calvo (1994), and based on its small size thought to belong to <i>Martinavis?
minor</i> or <i>M? whetstonei</i> by Walker and Dyke (2009).<br>
PVL-4273 was illustrated by Chinsamy et al. (1995) and its histology
was examined. <br>
Chiappe and Walker (2002) referred PVL-4030 to <i>Soroavisaurus</i>
and illustrated it. Walker and Dyke (2009) reassigned the tibiotarsus
to <i>Martinavis sp.</i>, though they mislabeled it PVL-4031 in their
materials list. <br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP V21711) (&lt;1 year old subadult) partial

caudal vertebrae, pygostyle (5.58 mm), scapulae, coracoids (12.37 mm),

(19.75 mm), tibiotarsus (23.08 mm), fibula, tarsometatarsus (19.71 mm),
nine pedal phalanges (?), four pedal unguals (?), body feathers, remiges<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Wang et al.,
2017) 14 dentary teeth; abbreviated, plough-shaped pygostyle with a
pygostyle/tarsometatarsus length ratio of about 0.28; coracoid
mediolaterally narrow with the<br>
sternal margin measuring only one quarter of the proximodistal length;
sternum bearing a V-shaped posterior margin and subequal posteromedial
and posterolateral processes; postacetabular process of ilium short and
strongly ventrally directed; proximodorsal process of  ischium
distally placed; pubis without distal expansion.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Wang et al.
(2017) listed manus shorter than humerus as diagnostic, but the hands
appear to be faked (see below).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This specimen was
discovered before August 2016.  Note the labels for the pubic and
ischial peduncles in supp. fig. 1b are reversed.  The pedal
phalanges appear to be partially fake, with e.g. the right pes
illustrated by the authors (supp. fig. 2) as having at least 16
non-ungual phalanges and five unguals when it should have ten and four
respectively.  In this pes, the supposedly articulated toes and
pedal ungual I don't seem to consist of real bone, while five phalanges
and three unguals are real but may have been displaced or even added
from another fossil.  In the less clearly photographed left pes,
14 non-ungual phalanges are illustrated of which four seem to be
genuine.  This calls into question the veracity of other portions
of the holotype, such as the hands which each appear poorly defined
with differing metacarpal II lengths and a more robust first digit than
expected in an ornithothoracine.  Most of the left hindlimb may
similarly be artificial or at least heavily reconstructed.  The
identity of the large masses by the supposed proximal left femur is
uncertain, but may indeed be at least partially synsacral pieces as
labeled in figure 1b.<br>

nasal absent; numerous, small, occlusally tapered and slightly recurved
teeth in upper and lower jaws; fibula ends in rounded expansion;
elongate hallux with metatarsal I and phalanx I-1 each almost half
length of metatarsal II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The name "Eopengornis" was first published by Zheng et
al. (2014), which was online on September 8th and in print on September
23rd. While a few basic details were given along with photos, the paper
was clearly meant to be published after Wang et al.'s (2014) official
description which appeared on October 17th. The absence of a species
name (ICZN Article 13.3), listed holotype (Article 16.4) and explicit
statement about it being a new genus (Article 16.1) means this early
occurance of the genus name is a nomen nudum.<br>
The holotype was purchased from a collector. Xu et al. (2023) list the
holotype's appendicular lengths as- humerus (35.6 mm), ulna (39.8 mm),
femur (24.1 mm), tibia (31.7 mm).<br>
Wang et al. (2014) found this was sister to <i>Pengornis</i> in a
version of O'Connor's bird analysis that excluded all non-Jehol
enantiornithines. <br>

<p><b><i><a name="Explorornisnessovi"></a>Explorornis</i></b>
Panteleyev, 1998<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Panteleyev, 1998) coracoid shaft primitively
not narrower than deep (also in <i>Elsornis</i>, <i>walkeri</i> and <i>Catenoleimus</i>).<br>
(proposed) crest along the dorsolateral edge of the shaft (also in <i>Eocathayornis</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Panteleyev (1998) also listed the broad distal
expansion in his diagnosis, but this is primitive for
ornithothoracines. The low coracoid tubercle is not different from <i>Incolornis</i>,
<i>Otogornis</i> or <i>Neuquenornis</i>. The gradually rising edge of
the dorsal coracoid fossa is also present in <i>walkeri, Incolornis,
Elsornis</i>, <i>Shanweiniao</i>, <i>Cathayornis</i> and <i>Eocathayornis</i>.
The coracoid glenoid facet is generally rather flat in
enantiornithines, and is eroded in <i>Explorornis</i> <i>nessovi</i>,
so Panteleev's characterization of a convex glenoid in the taxon seems
questionable. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Panteleyev also referred another species to this
genus- <i>E. walkeri</i>. While <i>walkeri</i> shares the
plesiomorphic dorsoventrally flattened coracoid shaft and shallow
dorsal fossa of <i>nessovi</i>, there are no shared derived characters
yet identified that could unite the species. O'Connor (2009) declared
all Bissekty enantiornithines based on coracoids to be nomina dubia,
though without detailed comparison.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) compared to <i>E</i>. sp. nov., lateral
and medial edges around dorsal coracoid fossa thin; coracoid shaft
thinner; lateral edge of coracoid completely concave.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was collected in 1991 and originally identified
as Enantiornithes by Nessov and Panteleev (1993) and Nessov (1997).
Panteleyev (1998) and it and referred it to Alexornithidae within
Alexornithiformes without comment. Nessov (1996) referred the then
unnamed specimen to Alexornithidae based on the narrow shaft, shallow
dorsal coracoid fossa and "slightly projected lateral margin". Yet
Nessov's classification is flawed, as for instance his enantiornithid <i>Enantiornis</i>
has a narrower shaft and less projected lateral margin than <i>Explorornis</i>,
while his concornithids such as <i>Iberomesornis</i> and <i>Cathayornis</i>
are comparable in these regards, and the latter also has a shallow
dorsal fossa. The coracoid fossa does indicate this is an
enantiornithine, as <i>Apsaravis</i> differs in having a concave
scapular facet. Within Enantiornithes, the concave lateral edge and
shallow dorsal fossa may mean this is a relatively basal taxon.<br>

(shaft broader than deep) is plesiomorphic and the slightly convex

referred it to Alexornithiformes fam. indet. without justification. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhou et al., 2008) premaxillae unfused; hooked
scapular acromion; globose humeral head that projects further
proximally than the deltopectoral crest.<br>
(after Hu et al., 2014) 9-13 dentary teeth that are small, stout, and
unrecurved.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Hu et al. (2014) described the new specimen IVPP
V18632 which they considered a subadult individual of a new species of <i>Pengornis</i>.
The differences they viewed as non-ontogenetic (nasal process of
maxilla more delicate; dorsal process of maxilla pointed rather than
rodlike [not comparable states]; furcula more slender with
interclavicular angle of 75 degrees rather than 65 [ontogenetic?];
humeral head flat rather than globose [not apparent]; deltopectoral
crest weaker and narrower [ontogenetic?]; pubis straight [in anterior
view in IVPP V18687?]) seem to be minor and comparable to those I
consider individual variation in other paravian species, so I refer
IVPP V18632 to <i>P. houi</i>. Note too that the interclavicular angle
and humeral head convexity is intermediate in IVPP V18687.<br>
O'Connor et al. (2015a) described a skeleton lacking the skull and neck
(STM 29-15) as Pengornithidae indet., with unspecified differences "in
pedal morphology and inferred adult body size" suggesting it was not
conspecific with IVPP V18632. As STM 29-15 is from the Jiufotang
Formation (O'Connor pers. comm., 2015), it is here tentatively assigned
to the only pengornithid from that formation that I recognize, <i>Pengornis</i>
itself. <br>
O'Connor et al. (2018) describe a hindlimb with medullary bone as
Pengornithidae indet., but given this is from the Jiufotang Formation
it is here tentaively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Parapengornis</span>-
Hu et al. (2015a) described a new genus of pengornithid, <i>Parapengornis
eurycaudatus</i>
based on basically complete specimen IVPP V18687. Xu et al. (2023) gave
different appendicular measurements- humerus (51.82 mm), ulna (55.65
mm), metacarpus (27.12 mm), femur (39.2 mm), tibia (40.42 mm),
metatarsus (18.9 mm).  Note the supposed quadratojugal is almost
certainly a postorbital, while the supposed palatines are likely
postdentary mandibular elements. They suggested several diagnostic
characters and referred IVPP V18632 to the taxon. Of their diagnostic
characters, the teeth of all birds are basally constricted, and those
of <i>Parapengornis</i> are not more numerous than <i>Pengornis</i>
(9 vs.13 in the dentary). The width of the pygostyle, lateral expansion
of the distal processes and and concavity of the posterior margin
cannot be evaluated in the laterally preserved element of <i>Pengornis</i>.
The furculae of all enantiornithines are Y-shaped, and that of <i>Parapengornis</i>
is not noticably more slender or straighter than <i>Pengornis</i>. Hu
et al. stated "pedal phalanx I-1 is longer than metatarsal I and
approximately half the length of metatarsal III", but I-1 seems to be
unpreserved in <i>Pengornis</i>. The more slender and recurved teeth
could be ontogenetic (as in the Eichstatt <i>Archaeopteryx</i> vs. the
London specimen), as could the less elongated anterior cervical
vertebrae (as in many living birds). Contra the text, the maxillary
fenestra doesn't seem to be larger or more anteriorly positioned than
in <i>Pengornis</i>, nor does the femoral head seem less developed.
The quadrate was said to differ from <i>Pengornis</i> in being
straight posteriorly, but the shape difference is due to it being in
anterior instead of lateral view. The lower deltopectoral crest is
potentially ontogenetic as in IVPP V18632. Stated proportional
differences (coracoid length/width ratio 192% vs. 202%; ulnohumeral
ratio 105% vs. 108%) are easily explainable by individual variation.
This leaves the following as potentially supporting <i>Parapengornis</i>'
validity- shorter posterodorsal lacrimal process; pygostyle shorter
than half the length of metatarsal III (41% vs. &gt;73%); metatarsal I
&gt;40% of metatarsal II length. IVPP V18632 cannot be shown to have
more recurved and slender teeth, as the apices are flat (taphonomic),
its elongated anterior cervicals (contra Hu et al.) and short
metatarsal I are like <i>Pengornis</i>. It does resemble <i>Parapengornis</i>'
type in having a short posterodorsal lacrimal process and pygostyle
shorter than half metatarsal III's length (47%). Given the intermediate
characters of IVPP V18632, it's viewed as most probable the three
specimens are conspecific.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Chiappeavis</span>-
O'Connor et al. (2016) described another new genus of pengornithid, <i>Chiappeavis
magnapremaxillo</i>,
based on almost complete specimen STM 29-11. Note the electronic
version was published on December 31, 2015 and did not mention ZooBank,
and the paper version was not published until January 11, 2016. 
Thus ICZN Article 8.5.3 (a work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred") made "Chiappeavis
magnapremaxillo" O'Connor et al. 2015 a nomen nudum until 2016. 
Xu et al. (2023) provide appendicular measurements. Several characters
were listed as supposedly diagnostic here as well.
The premaxilla was said to have a larger body and convex ventral
margin, but the convex element has far too long of a ventral margin to
be a premaxilla, so is more likely an incomplete maxilla with the base
of the ascending process. The actual right premaxilla is then just the
small anterodorsal portion right below the partially preserved left
premaxilla, and has no visible ventral margin. The posterodorsal
premaxillary process was claimed to be longer than other pengornithids,
almost reaching the frontals. Yet this bone is highly abraded just
posterior to figure 2A's 'l pm' label, so that this posterior portion
could easily belong to the right nasal instead. This is bolstered by
the fact it's the same width as the left nasal and that the right nasal
is otherwise missing. The synsacrum has eight vertebrae (as in IVPP
V18632), while the authors claim <i>Pengornis</i>' holotype has seven.
Yet the description of the latter says only that seven are visible, but
that the anterior end is covered, and indeed there could easily be
another one beneath the ilium. STM 29-15 only has seven but is
obviously younger based on its unfused sterna. The "median trabeculae"
[sic = posteromedian process] of <i>Chiappeavis</i> is said to have
diagnostic concave lateral margins, but this is also true in IVPP
V18632 (though not STM 29-15) and is unpreserved in <i>Parapengornis</i>,
while <i>Pengornis</i>' holotype doesn't preserve the sternum. The
posteromedian angle of the sternum is said to be narrow, but while its
53 degree angle is a bit less than IVPP V18632's (at 68) or STM 29-15's
(at 66), <i>Parapengornis</i>' holotype could have an identical angle
if complete, and again <i>Pengornis</i>' holotype doesn't preserve the
element. Finally, the authors claim the proximal articular surface of
the tibia is laterodistally inclined, but this is only true of the left
tibia, with the right tibia having a right angle between the surface
and the long axis of the bone. Furthermore, <i>Pengornis</i>' holotype
and IVPP V18632 both have inclined surfaces, though <i>Parapengornis</i>'
holotype lacks them. Given the variation in <i>Chiappeavis</i>'
holotype, the variation is likely due to perspective or taphonomy.
Besides the characters listed in the diagnosis, O'Connor et al. note
the short anterior cervicals are like the <i>Parapengornis</i>
holotype but unlike <i>Pengornis</i>' holotype. As the latter is
larger than the others, this may support ontogenetic cervical
elongation. They also correctly note the long pygostyle is like <i>Pengornis</i>'
holotype, but unlike IVPP V18632 or <i>Parapengornis</i>' holotype.
Finally, the short metatarsal I is said to be like <i>Pengornis</i>'
holotype, and is additionally like IVPP V18632 but unlike <i>Parapengornis</i>'
holotype or STM 29-15. Thus the only real difference from <i>Pengornis</i>'
holotype is the shorter anterior cervicals, and while there are a few
differences from other pengornithid specimens (laterally concave
posteromedian sternal process unlike STM 29-15; narrower posterior
sternal angle than STM 29-15 and IVPP V18632; long pygostyle unlike STM
29-15, IVPP V18632 and <i>Parapengornis</i>' type; short metatarsal I
unlike STM 29-15 and <i>Parapengornis</i>' type), there's no pattern
of character distribution that would suggest separate pengornithid
species (e.g. <i>Parapengornis</i> shares the cervical length and
probably sternal angle, while IVPP V18632 is different in cervical
length but shares metatarsal I length). Thus all Jiufotang
pengornithids are still retained in <i>Pengornis houi</i>.&nbsp; Wang et al. (2004) recently stated &quot;after in-person reassessment we consider ... <em>Chiappeavis</em> ... to be edentulous&quot; as &quot;the lack of dentition or alveoli throughout the premaxilla, maxilla, and dentary in this otherwise well preserved (nearly complete, articulated, and preserving soft tissues) specimen strongly suggests that the absence of preserved teeth is a true feature of this taxon&quot;, but considering e.g. the <em>Hongshanornis</em> falsely edentulous holotype and the great similarity to other pengornithids otherwise it is still regarded as ambiguous pending CT scans or x-rays.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Yuanchuavis</span>-
Wang et al. (2021) described a supposed new taxon of
pengornithid- <span style="font-style: italic;">Yuanchuavis kompsosoura</span>
based on IVPP V27883, a
skeleton missing pectoral girdles and forelimbs.  Regarding its
validity, the premaxilla is said to have five teeth but the medial view
of the right premaxilla in figure S1B shows the last tooth is upside
down so that the root protrudes ventrally as if it's a crown tip in
lateral view, and so is probably a dentary tooth. 
Similarly, the same figure shows the edentulous tip of the bone is
exaggerated by the first tooth being displaced and artificially angled
posteriorly.  The actual edentulous portion is only two FABLs
long, similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>,
IVPP V18632 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span>
(right premaxilla; first tooth displaced and loose in left
element).  The supposedly short anterior and posterior lacrimal
processes are similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span>,
IVPP V18632 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>
except that the posterior process of the latter is longer as
interpreted by O'Connor.  The large hypapophyses on dorsals one
and two are difficult to evaluate in other <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>
as anterior dorsals are usually disarticulated and oriented at odd
angles when exposed at all.  Contra the authors, the dorsoventral
depth of the dorsal central fossae (e.g. D5) are similar to IVPP
V18632, <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chiappeavis</span>.  Finally, the
short anterodorsal pygostyle processes are also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chiappeavis</span> (eroded in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>), while the elongate
anteroventral process is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span>, partly exposed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span> and probably hidden under
caudal vertebrae in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chiappeavis</span>. 
Of the variable characters noted above for <span style="font-style: italic;">Parapengornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaippeavis</span>,
the pygostyle/metatarsus ratio is intermediate (66%), metatarsal I is
42% the length of metatarsal II, and anterior cervicals are elongate,
again showing no pattern and no distinct separated groups of
ratios.  Thus like other Jiufotang pengornithids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yuanchuavis</span> is
synonymized with <span style="font-style: italic;">Pengornis</span>
here.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Relationships</span>- Zhou et al.
(2008) found <i>Pengornis</i> to be more derived than <i>Protopteryx</i>,
but outside a clade containing <i>Concornis</i>, <i>Gobipteryx</i>, <i>Neuquenornis</i>
and <i>Cathayornis</i> when entered into Clarke's matrix. Hu et al.
(2014) entered the holotype and their new specimen into O'Connor's
matrix and found them to be the most basal non-<i>Protopteryx</i>,
non-longipterygid enantiornithines. This is the same result as found in
the more extensive analysis of Wang et al. (2014), where it is
mislabeled IVPP V18631. Hu et al. (2015) added the <i>Parapengornis</i>
specimen and three characters, and found pengornithids to be more
deeply nested in Enantiornithes than before, though the authors doubted
this was true.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Dalsatt et al., 2014) small teeth; well
developed acrocoracoid process; long posterolateral steranl process and
very short posteromedial sternal process; posterolateral process
expanded distally; metacarpals II and III nearly equal in width with
almost no intermetacarpal space; humerus with prominent head and much
shorter than ulna.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon was initially announced in a thesis
(Dalsatt, 2012) then described in a rather poorly translated paper
(Dalsatt et al., 2014), and found to be an enantiornithine more derived
than <i>Protopteryx</i> and <i>Pengornis</i> using a version of
Clarke's bird analysis.<br>

<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous <br>
Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan</b> <br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 3472) (~185 mm) distal tibiotarsus (4.5 mm
wide) <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Nessov and Jarkov (1989) initially included
characters now known to be more widespread in enantiornithines. They
said the retinaculum tuberosity is poorly developed and distally
placed, but there are two tuberosities, the weaker of which is
proximally placed as in e.g. <i>Gobipteryx</i>, <i>Nanantius</i> and <i>Qiliania</i>.
The distal tuberosity is actually more prominent than the former two,
though comparable and plesiomorphic in any case. The distal transverse
width (222% of minimal shaft width) is not greater than e.g. <i>Nanantius</i>
or ?<i>Soroavisaurus</i> PVL-4033. The medial condyle (misidentified as
lateral by the authors) is less broad than e.g. <i>Gobipteryx</i> or
PVL-4033. The medial condyle also has a rounded proximal margin in e.g.
<i>Gobipteryx</i>, <i>Qiliania</i> and PVL-4033. <br>
Kurochkin (1996) listed a few new characters to distinguish <i>Sazavis</i>
from <i>Gobipteryx</i> (as his new taxon <i>Nanantius valifanovi</i>).
Of these, the supposedly more abrupt transition from tibiotarsal shaft
to condyles isn't different from e.g. <i>Qiliania</i> or PVL-4033. The
medial condyle is more circular in these two specimens as well.
Finally, the intercondylar fossa is more medially placed in e.g. <i>Qiliania</i>
and <i>Nanantius</i>, and is symplesiomorphic. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov and Jarkov (1989) initially assigned <i>Sazavis</i>
to ?Alexornithidae within Enantiornithes, but mistook the medial
condyle for the lateral and vice versa. O'Connor (2009) declared <i>Sazavis</i>
a nomen dubium because she misunderstood "the distinguishing
characteristic of the specimen" as being "the transverse paracondylar
expansion" as opposed to being "only medially expanded in <i>Gobipteryx</i>."
She correctly noted the former morphology is also present in the then
unnamed <i>Qiliania</i>. Yet this was not a character mentioned by
Nessov and Jarkov in their initial diagnosis nor one mentioned by
Kurochkin as differing from <i>Gobipteryx</i> (his <i>Nanantius
valifanovi</i>). Yet <i>Sazavis</i> differs from <i>Qiliania</i> in
having a less anteriorly projected lateral condyle, a larger medial
condyle (56% of distal width vs. 53%) especially visible as its distal
boundary, and more developed distal retinaculum tuberosity. Resolving
whether <i>Sazavis</i> is diagnostic compared to other
enantiornithines requires a more detailed comparison of tibiotarsi.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Li et al., 2010) skull three times longer than
tall; large conical premaxillary teeth; widely spaced premaxillary
teeth; teeth strongly recurved; frontal broad and flat; dentary long;
dentary teeth similar to but shorter than those of premaxilla; anterior

sternal process slender with slightly expanded distal end;
posteromedial sternal process short; ulnohumeral ratio ~110%; radius
about 75% as wide as ulna.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Li et al. (2020) assigned <i>"Camptodontus" yangi</i>
to Longipterygidae based on the "long and thick beak, similar sternum
and furcula", but it has not been included in a phylogenetic analysis.
They described it as a new genus of enantiornithine, but the name is
preoccupied by a carabid beetle named 184 years earlier (Martyniuk,
2012) so was replaced by Camptodontornis (Demirjian, 2019).  Wang
et al. (2014) referred the holotype to <i>Longipteryx</i> based on the
"large teeth strongly curved caudally [and] lateral trabecula of
sternum slightly laterally directed with simple distal expansion",
though they did not state whether the species was valid or use the new
combination <i>Longipteryx yangi</i> posited above. Martyniuk proposed
a possible synonymy with <i>Boluochia</i> based on tooth size. The
latter genus itself has been compared favorably to <i>Longipteryx</i>
by O'Connor, and the relationship between these specimens is presently
uncertain. <br>
This is seemingly the same taxon as DNHM D2889, a specimen called <i>Longipteryx</i>
sp. by O'Connor (O'Connor, 2009; O'Connor and Chiappe, 2011), both of
which have larger premaxillary teeth than the <i>L. chaoyangensis</i>
holotype or IVPP V12552. Wang et al. (2015) fully described it,
referring it to Yuanjiawa in the Yixian Formation, whereas O'Connor
listed it as from the Jiufotang Formation like other specimens with
this morphology. Wang et al. referred DNHM D2889 to <i>Longipteryx
chaoyangensis</i> while noting some differences (forelimb/hindlimb
ratio 1.2 vs. 1.5; femorotibiotarsal ratio .8 vs. 1.0; femorohumeral
ratio .8 vs. .6; clavicular arm / hypocleidium ratio 1.1 vs. .8), which
they ascribed to age. <br>
O'Connor (2009) also referred DNHM D2566 to <i>Longipteryx</i> sp..<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- O'Connor et al. (2009) also list several other
characters in the diagnosis which they state are found in related taxa
as well. The snout length (62% of skull length) is overlapped by <i>Longirostravis</i>
(60-64%) and very similar to <i>Longipteryx</i> (64%) and <i>Rapaxavis</i>
(65%). Manual phalanx II-2 is reduced and wedge-shaped in <i>Longirostravis</i>
and <i>Rapaxavis</i> too. The low interclavicular angle (~40 degrees)
is also present in <i>Iberomesornis</i> and <i>Concornis</i>. The
length of the hypocleideum being shorter than the interclavicular
symphysis is not necessarily true, as the authors state the
hypocleideal length is unknown. The distallly non-branched
posterolateral sternal processes are plesiomorphic for
enantiornithines. Metatarsal III is longest plesiomorphically for
theropods. O'Connor et al. note <i>Rapaxavis</i> also has a
longitudinal crest on the central portion of its pedal unguals' sides.
Two pairs of elongate retrices are also present in <i>Paraprotopteryx</i>.
The pedal ungual and claw curvature is similar to that of <i>Rapaxavis</i>.

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Morschhauser et al., 2009) six sacral
vertebrae; posterolateral sternal processes with two prominent branches
and a smaller third branch; anterolateral sternal ossifications (also
in <i>Concornis</i>).<br>
(after O'Connor et al., 2011) rostrum ~60% of skull length; dentition
anteriorly restricted; premaxillary process of maxilla approximately
three times longer than the jugal process; nasals lacking maxillary
process, external nares schizorhinal; furcula with short
interclavicular symphysis and interclavicular angle of 50 degrees;
coracoid lateral and sternal margins straight; coracoidal facets of
sternum defining an obtuse angle of approximately 110 degrees; femur
80% the length of the tibiotarsus; penultimate pedal phalanges longer
than preceding phalanges.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Morschhauser et al. (2009) list several other
characters in their diagnosis as well. The long and slightly curved
snout is also present in <i>Longipteryx</i> and <i>Longirostravis</i>.
<i>Shanweiniao</i> seems to have as few dentary teeth as <i>Rapaxavis</i>.
<i>Boluochia</i>, <i>Dapingfangornis</i>, <i>Jibeinia</i>, <i>Longipteryx</i>,
<i>Pengornis</i> and <i>Sinornis</i> also have six free caudal
vertebrae. The lack of <i>Longirostravis</i>' antler-shaped
posterolateral sternal processes is plesiomorphic, as is the unexpanded
posteromedian sternal process. The lack of manual unguals I and II is
shared with <i>Longirostravis</i> and <i>Shanweiniao</i>. Having
hindlimbs longer compared to the forelimbs than in <i>Longipteryx</i>
is plesiomorphic, with <i>Longirostravis</i> having a similar ratio. <i>Longirostravis</i>
has a similarly long hallux compared to tarsometatarsal length, as
opposed to <i>Longipteryx</i> and <i>Shanweiniao</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was first reported by Morschhauser et
al. (2006) as a juvenile <i>Longirostravis</i> or a new related taxon,
and was used in the phylogenetic analysis of O'Connor et al. (2009)
before it was named. This found it to be a longipterygid sister to <i>Longirostravis</i>
(though it was misspelled DMNH D2567/8 in figure 8 and switched with <i>Zhongornis</i>),
which Morschhauser et al. (2009) agreed with when they named and
described the taxon a few months later. O'Connor et al. (2011)
redescribed the specimen once it was fully prepared.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Li et al., 2007) hypcleidium equals clavicular
ramus in length.<br>
(after O'Connor, 2009; based on LPM B00017) low and delicate spinal
crest on synsacrum; coracoid with convex lateral margin; sternal margin
of coracoid slightly ventrally concave; lateral corner of distal
coracoid distal to medial corner; sternum with posterolateral processes
projecting posteriorly further than posteromedian process;
pneumotricipital fossa rudimentary; deltopectoral crest tapering
distally; manual digit I ~50% length of metacarpal II; manual ungual I
larger than ungual II; tibiotarsus proximal surface angled so that
medial margin is elevated compared to lateral margin; pedal ungual III
less recurved than II and IV; proximal half of pedal unguals with
laterally projecting ridges.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Li et al. (2007) listed numerous other
characters in their diagnosis of <i>Alethoalaornis</i> and
Alethoalaornithidae. The beak does not seem longer than most
enantiornithines (and O'Connor 2009 states preservation prevents
determination of its length), while its apparent sharpness in LPM 00038
is due to preparation and that of LPM 00040 could be due to that or
preservation. Two to three pairs of premaxillary teeth seem to be
present in <i>Pengornis</i>. Heterocoelous cervical vertebrae and thin
hypocleidia are present in most enantiornithines. A "well developed"
sternal carina and "metacarpal formed" are too vague to evaulate. Deep
capital grooves are present in all enantiornithines except <i>Elsornis</i>.
O'Connor notes pneumatic foramina are absent in referred specimen LPM
B00017 at least. The manual unguals on digits I and II are reduced a
similar amount in <i>Hebeiornis</i> and <i>Shanweiniao</i>, while
many derived enantiornithines lack an ungual on digit III. Contra their
description, the illustration suggests that the metatarsals increase in
length laterally instead of being equally long. This is also present in
<i>Longipteryx</i> and <i>Boluochia</i>. O'Connor states metatarsal
III is longest in LMP B00017 while II and IV are subequal, which is
primitive for theropods. Pedal unguals are longer than their pedal
phalanges in most enantiornithines, including <i>Pengornis</i>, <i>Shanweiniao</i>
and <i>Sinornis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Li et al. (2007) named this taxon in a description
which was largely published in Chinese, with only a short English
summary. They erected the new family Alethoalaornithidae for the genus,
which they placed in Cathayornithiformes. This latter assignment was
based on "similar length of trochlea at distal end of tarsometatarsus."
If this refers to equal width, it is unlike <i>Sinornis</i>, which has
trochlea II widest, and if it refers to distal extent, it is also
unlike <i>Sinornis</i> which has trochlea III longest (whereas <i>Alethoalaornis</i>
is illustrated as having trochlea IV longest, though LPM B00017 has III
longest). O'Connor (2009) notes the holotype has a new collection
number (unknown to her) as LPM 00009 is now a <i>Confuciusornis</i>
specimen. She noted the only specimen available for study (LPM B00017)
is distinguishable from other enantiornmithines, but because Li et
al.'s "diagnosis does not match observations in LPMB00017, it is
possible this specimen is not referable to <i>Alethoalaornis agitornis</i>,
or that the original diagnosis is inaccurate."<br>
Hu et al. (2013) mentioned LPM 00032 (as PMOL-AB00032) as a new
enantiornithine taxon similar to <i>Bohaiornis</i> in size and limb
element ratios, but diagnosed it based on- neural spines of dorsal
vertebrae with anteroposteriorly strongly expanded tips; longitudinally
grooved ventral surface of synsacrum; coracoid with straight lateral
margin; clavicular rami medially curved; oval outline of sternum with
posteromedian process distinctly wider than posteroolateral processes;
forelimb and hind limb subequal in length; humeral head flat; manual
digit I extending almost as far distally as metacarpal II. <br>

Jiufotang Formation, Liaoning, China</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP V12353; lost) skull (28 mm), gastralia,
coracoids (16 mm), incomplete furcula?, sternum, forelimb elements
including humerus (30 mm) and ulnae (29 mm), carpometacarpi (15 mm),
pubes (24.5 mm), proximal tibia, fibula, numerous other elements<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Described by Hou et al. (2002) in a book which has not
yet been translated to English, making information on this specimen
extremely limited. Of the characters in the original diagnosis, toothed
jaws, a well developed posteriorly distributed sternal keel, humerus
slightly shorter than ulna and distally fused pubes are all
plesiomorphic for Enantiornithes. <i>Cathayornis yandica</i> only
differs from these in that its ulna is slightly shorter than its
humerus, but variations of 5-10% are known for other basal birds, so
this doesn't guarantee a valid distinguishing characteristic. The
longitudinal ridge between the frontals (absent according to O'Connor
and Dyke, 2010), and tubercles on "both sides of the frontal" are
difficult to evaluate given taphonomy and the lack of frontal
description and preservation in most enantiornithines. The last
proposed diagnostic feature- posterolateral sternal processes shorter
than posteromedian processes, does appear to be valid. This is also
present in <i>Protopteryx</i>, probably <i>Elsornis</i>, <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
and <i>Hebeiornis</i> though. O'Connor and Dyke said further
preparation and examination are needed to validate the species, though
Wang and Liu (2016) state the holotype is lost.<br>

Li, Li, Zhang, Zhou, Bai, Zhang and Ba, 2008<br>
<b>Early Cretaceous<br>
Jingchuan Formation, Inner Mongolia, China</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (BMNHC Ph 000110) (subadult) ten cervical vertebrae,
two cervical ribs, six dorsal vertebrae, nine dorsal ribs, scapulae
(one incomplete; 23 mm), coracoids (17.6 mm), sternum (21 mm), humeri
(one incomplete; 31.8 mm) radii (34.4 mm), ulnae (36.5 mm),
carpometacarpi (one incomplete; 15 mm), phalanx II-1, phalanx II-2,
phalanx III-1, femora (30.8 mm), tibiotarsi (38.6 mm), metatarsal I,
phalanx I-1, pedal ungual I, tarsometatarsi (one partial; 19 mm),
phalanx II-1, phalanx II-2, pedal ungual II, phalanx III-1, phalanx
III-2, phalanx III-3, pedal ungual III, feathers<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang and Liu, 2016) differs from <i>Cathayornis</i>
in- distal edge of posterolateral sternal process rounded (also in <i>Longipteryx</i>;
ontogenetic?); posteromedian sternal process distally blunt; lateral
process at base of posterolateral sternal process absent.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Li et al. (2008) use the posteriorly diverging
posterolateral sternal processes to distinguish this species from <i>Cathayornis
yandica</i>, but this is true of most enantiornithines (e.g. <i>Alethoalaornis,
Boluochia, Houornis, Concornis, Dapingfangornis, Elsornis,
Eocathayornis, Eoenantiornis, Hebeiornis, Jibeinia</i>). The authors
also distinguished it by its posteromedian sternal process which
extends posteriorly past the posterolateral processes. This is also
found in <i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Eocathayornis</i>, <i>Eoenantiornis</i>,
<i>Hebeiornis</i>, <i>Shanweiniao</i> and probably <i>Elsornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Li et al. discovered this specimen in 2002 and
described it as a new species of <i>Cathayornis</i> in 2008. They
assigned it to <i>Cathayornis</i> based on several characters. The
longitudinal radius groove is present in all enantiornithines more
derived than <i>Longipteryx</i>. <i>Cathayornis</i> actually has a
broad intermetacarpal space (contra Li et al.), with the illusion of a
nearly absent space in some enantiornithines due to postmortem
distortion of the flattened third metacarpal. Several other
enantiornithines have only one phalanx on manual digit III (<i>Alethoalaornis,
Concornis, Eoalulavis, Eoenantiornis, Gobipteryx, Hebeiornis</i>, <i>Sinornis</i>),
which is often closely appressed to phalanx II-1 when articulated (e.g.
<i>Eoalulavis</i>, <i>Hebeiornis, Sinornis</i>) and is actually fused
in <i>Alethoalaornis</i> based on its figure. Finally, Li et al. state
"proportions of limb bones" are similar between <i>Cathayornis</i> and
<i>chabuensis</i>. The ulnohumeral ratios are indeed quite similar (98%
vs. 97%), but so are those of <i>Houornis</i> (100%), <i>Rapaxavis</i>
(100%) and <i>Longirostravis</i> (98%). The humerofemoral ratio of <i>chabuensis</i>
(113%) is similar to <i>Cathayornis</i> (117%), but so are <i>Houornis</i>
(113%), <i>Eoenantiornis</i> (111%) and <i>Sinornis</i> (114%). The
tibiofemoral ratio of 127% is again close to <i>Cathayornis</i>'
(126%), but so are <i>Dapingfangornis</i> (126%), <i>Jibeinia</i>
(126%), <i>Shanweiniao</i> (128%), <i>Longirostravis</i> (129%) and <i>Sinornis</i>
(124%). The tarsometatarsofemoral ratio of 63% is a bit lower than <i>Cathayornis</i>'
(~66%), with <i>Houornis</i> (63%), <i>Gobipteryx</i> (~69%), <i>Largirostrornis</i>
(67%), <i>Shanweiniao</i> (68%), and <i>Shenquiornis</i> (64%) all
being at least as similar to <i>Cathayornis</i> in this regard. Thus
there are no unique shared characters with <i>Cathayornis</i> and
while the limb proportions are mostly similar, they are not necessarily
derived. It is here excluded from <i>Cathayornis</i>. O'Connor and
Dyke (2010) and Wang and Liu (2016) agreed the characters did not
justify referral to <i>Cathayornis</i>. Both papers agreed it could be
distinguished from <i>Cathayornis, </i>though the latter paper
declared it a nomen dubium without stating which taxa it could not be
distinguished from. Wang and Liu found chabuensis to be more closely
related to <i>Hebeiornis</i> than to <i>Cathayornis</i>.<br>
Zhang et al. (2010) referred a new specimen (OFMB-3) from the same
locality to <i>Cathayornis chabuensis</i>, interpreting the
differences (broadly triangular distal expansions of the posterolateral
sternal processes; post-costal sternal processes) as being due to
greater ontogenetic age. Wang and Liu (2016) suggested this could not
be demonstrated, and given the lack of shared characters with <i>chabuensis</i>,
declared OFMB-3 indeterminate.<br>

?(IVPP V10896) specimen including premaxilla, dentary and coracoid
(Martin and Zhou, 1997) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhou et al., 1992) transverse processes of
seventh and eighth sacral vertebrae fusing distally.<br>
(after Zhou, 1999) manual ungual I slightly longer than ungual II
[145%] (also in <i>Bohaiornis</i> 125-150% and <i>Sulcavis</i> 135%).<br>
(after O'Connor and Dyke, 2010) postacetabular process with almost
straight dorsal margin (also in bohaiornithids and <i>Eoalulavis</i>);
postacetabular process less tapered than <i>Sinornis</i> (also in <i>Zhouornis</i>
and <i>Eoalulavis</i>).<br>
(after Wang and Liu, 2016) postcostal sternal process.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou et al. (1992) included numerous
ornithothoracine symplesiomorphies in their original diagnosis- cranial
elements "seldom fused"; premaxilla toothed; dentary toothed; pygostyle
long; "straight and slender" scapula; strut-like coracoid; sternal keel
low; low and flat humeral head; very small pneumotricipital fossa;
semilunate dorsal ulnar condyle; carpometacarpus; manual unguals
present; pelvic bones unfused; fibula "weak" and unfused with tibia;
pedal unguals strongly curved and pointed; pedal unguals with
"undeveloped" extensor tubercles. Other characters are common in
enentiornithines- synsacrum including 8 vertebrae; posterolateral and
posteromedial sternal processes. The foramen magnum is unpreserved, so
Zhou et al's listing it as posteroventrally oriented cannot be
verified. Contra Zhou et al., the metatarsus is fused.<br>
Hou (1997) also included more characters symplesiomorphic for
ornithothoracines- rostrum relatively long and low; pygostyle present;
scapula with oblique acromion process; humeral head small or
undeveloped; humeral medial and lateral tuberosities distinct; ulna
robust and slightly curved; small olecranon process; radius slender
with expanded proximal end; carpal trochlea; reduced unguals on first
and second manual digits; fibula is long and "conical" (actually
transversely flattened); pedal unguals not "extremely curved". Other
characters used by Hou are common in enantiornithines- posterolateral
sternal processes well developed with termini expanded as oblique
triangles; humerus and ulna equivalent in length [u/h 102%].<br>
Zhou (1999) listed a supracetabular crest that is anterodorsally
developed, but among advanced enantiornithines this is only otherwise
determinable in <i>Sinornis</i> (present) and <i>Bohaiornis</i>
(absent). Other characters listed are common in enantiornithines- large
and shallow metacarpal incision in pisiform; phalanx III-1 ~50% [46%]
of II-1 length; phalanx III-1 expanded proximally. The supposedly
absent antitrochanter is due to damage (O'Connor and Dyke, 2010).<br>
O'Connor and Dyke (2010) listed other characters which differ from <i>Sinornis</i>,
but of these the supposedly blunter postacetabular process tip seems
comparable, and the other two are common in enantiornithines- pygostyle
longer [63% of femur vs. 55%]; manual phalanx III-1 straight. <br>
Wang and Liu (2016) also listed posterolateral sternal process extends
further posteriorly than posteromedian process, which is found in
several other derived enantiornithines. A tapered posteromedian sternal
process is primitive. The supposedly unforked jugal whose posterior end
curves dorsally is problematic. The presence of a posterior process is
unclear, and the dorsal half of the apparant dorsal process may be
another element. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1990 and first
mentioned in an abstract by Zhou (1992) before being named and
described by Zhou et al. (1992). It was later redescribed in both Hou
(1997) and Zhou's (1999) thesis. <i>Cathayornis yandica</i> was
considered a junior synonym of <i>Sinornis santensis</i> by Sereno et
al. (2002), but was revalidated by O'Connor (2009; published as
O'Connor and Dyke, 2010).<br>
Xu et al. (1999) listed <i>Cathayornis shanwangensis</i> as a fossil
bird along with <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>
in their announcement of <i>Hebeiornis</i>, but this is near certainly
an error (in both the Chinese and English). As the other three listed
genera are famous, the similarly well known <i>Cathayornis yandica</i>
would be expected as opposed to a new species. It's possible the
authors were thinking of the phasianid <i>Shandongornis shanwanensis</i>
from the Miocene Shanwan Series of Shandong, China.<br>
<b>Referred specimens</b>- Hou (1997) includes a photograph of an
articulated pelvis (IVPP coll.) which was illustrated as <i>Cathayornis
yandica</i> by Zhou (1999) and Zhou and Hou (2002) without comment.
Martin and Zhou (1997) refer IVPP V10896 and V10916 to <i>Cathayornis</i>.
The latter was made the holotype of <i>Eocathayornis</i> in 2002,
while V10896 was listed as <i>Cathayornis</i> indet. by O'Connor and
Chiappe (2011). Zhou reported "over a dozen" <i>Cathayornis</i>
specimens were known, though he only lists IVPP V10896 and V9936 as
referred specimens, the latter photographed as a referred specimen by
Zhou and Hou. O'Connor and Dyke (2010) incorrectly say Hou referred
IVPP V10533 and V10904 to <i>Cathayornis yandica</i>, but he actually
referred these to <i>C. caudatus</i> (now <i>Houornis</i>). O'Connor
(2009) lists DNHM 2510/1 and 2567/8 in her thesis as <i>Cathayornis</i>
sp., but otherwise only refers to them as Enantiornithes or
Euenantiornithes indet.. <br>
Besides noting basic surangular morphology, DNHM 2510/1 remains
undescribed and is unillustrated, so cannot be evaluated from
publications unless O'Connor's data matrix is examined.<br>
DNHM 2567/8 has postcostal sternal processes, so may be correctly
referred to <i>Cathayornis</i>. <br>
IVPP V9936 is 46% larger than the holotype, but difficult to compare
otherwise as the type's metatarsus is only partially preserved and the
few phalanges preserved in each specimen are disarticulated.<br>
IVPP V10896 was listed as preserving a premaxilla and dentary by
O'Connor and Chiappe, and to have a coracoid 2.5 times longer than wide
by Zhou (2002). The coracoid's dimensions in the holotype are uncertain
(estimated at 2.3 by Zhou, 1999), as the preserved coracoid is broken
in two with an unknown amount under the sternum. Wang and Liu (2016)
said V10896 "preserves an articulated pelvic girdle", but this is
probably an error referring to the unnumbered IVPP specimen.<br>
The IVPP articulated pelvis has a highly convex dorsal postacetabular
margin and large amount of taper, unlike <i>Cathayornis</i>, so is
probably wrongly referred. It's listed as an unnamed Jiufotang
enantiornithine here.<br>

Jiufotang Formation, Liaoning, China</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (LPM 00039) skull (28 mm), sclerotic plates,
mandibles, hyoids, cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, dorsal ribs,
sacrum, six caudal vertebrae, pygostyle (15 mm), furcula, sternum (17
mm), scapulae, coracoids (15 mm), humeri (22 mm), radii, ulnae (27 mm),
phalanx I-1, manual ungual I, carpometacarpi (11 mm), phalanx II-1,
phalanx II-2, manual ungual II, phalanx III-1, ilia, pubes, ischia,
femora (23 mm), tibiotarsi (29 mm), fibula, metatarsal I, phalanx I-1,
pedal ungual I, tarsometatarsi (16 mm), phalanx II-1, phalanx II-2,

ungual III, phalanx IV-1, phalanx IV-2, phalanx IV-3, phalanx IV-4,
pedal ungual IV, feather impressions<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Li et al., 2006) straight lateral coracoid
edge; short hypocleidium; articular surfaces for coracoids on sternum
at small angle (~100 degrees) to each other; distal expansion of
posterolateral sternal process hooked anterolaterally; elongate ulna
(&gt;107% of humeral length); extremely slender radius (~30% of ulnar
width) (?); elongate metacarpal I (~34-40% of metacarpal II length)
(?); metatarsal II trochlea not significantly wider than metatarsal III
trochlea (?).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Li et al. (2006) listed numerous features in
their diagnosis. The supposedly sharp rostrum is due to the dorsal
snout being either crushed or missing. The supposed median nasal horn
is questionable. I wouldn't be surprised if it were the standard
maniraptoriform laterally projected lacrimal 'horn', viewed ventrally.
This would make sense, because the frontal's concave upper margin would
then be the lateral orbital margin in life. O'Connor (2009) agrees,
saying "a nasal crest cannot be confirmed although at this time, it
also cannot be entirely refuted." The frontal is domed posteriorly as
typical for birds, not flat. O'Connor notes the dentary is not longer
than in other enantiornithines, nor are the teeth more widely spaced.
The "high feathered crown" is a taphonomic illusion often seen in
feathered Jehol specimens. <br>
<b>Description</b>- What appear to be parietals are preserved posterior
to the skull, as seen in the photo of the skeleton (though they aren't
illustrated). The ventral margin of the skull is very well preserved,
with a maxilla strongly resembling <i>Hebeiornis</i>' and a typical
bowed enantiornithine-grade jugal with an expanded anterior end. The
'tympanic' is actually one of the few well preserved
enantiornithine-grade quadratojugals. O'Connor (2009) notes at least
three maxillary teeth and seven dentary teeth are preserved, contra the
at least six maxillary and ten dentary teeth reported by Li et al.
(2006). The described 'palatines' are closer in position to pterygoids.
The fenestra posteroventral to the 'nasal horn' appears to be a broken
or disarticulated space between the frontal and nasal/lacrimal. Two
sclerotic plates are apparent, but I don't know what Li et al.
identified as a vomer or lacrimal. <br>
The dentaries seem to have an elongate posterodorsal process, which
combined with the surangular's outline, indicate a large external
mandibular fenestra. I can't identify what Li et al. describe as a
prearticular or articular. <br>
The cervical vertebrae are described as heterocoelous, but this could
be only partial heterocoely. The presence of at least eight sacral
vertebrae indicate an ornithothoracine, while the long pygostyle is
characteristic of basal avebrevicaudans. <br>
The furcula is said to have a short hypocleidium, which would be
atypical of enantiornithine-grade birds (though known in juveniles and <i>Aberratiodontus</i>).
Notably there is no other evidence this is a young individual, as the
sternal posterolateral processes are present, the carpometacarpus and
tarsometatarsus are fused, and the pygostyle is completely fused. There
is a furcula-shaped structure in the illustration, but it's so atypical
(one clavicular branch more slender and drawn unfused to the rest;
hypocleidium extends posterolaterally; interclavicular angle comparable
to basal pygostylians) that either it was drawn exceedingly poorly or
not all of it is supposed to be a furcula (or both). <br>
The short sternum with fused distal posterolateral processes indicate
an enantiornithine-grade bird. The anterior margin is more acute than
most eumaniraptorans, with the exceptions of <i>Longirostravis</i>, <i>Aberratiodontus</i>,
<i>Cuspirostrisornis</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Ambiortus</i>. The
posterolateral processes end in small expansions, as in <i>Jibeinia</i>,
<i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Boluochia</i>, <i>Hebeiornis</i> and <i>Aberratiodontus</i>.
However, <i>Dapingfangornis</i>' are apomorphically hooked
anterolaterally. The posteromedial processes are very poorly developed,
as in <i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Longipteryx</i> and <i>Hebeiornis</i> (<i>Aberratiodontus</i>
lacks them entirely). The posteromedian process is unexpanded, as in <i>Jibeinia</i>,
<i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Longipteryx</i>, <i>Boluochia</i>, <i>Hebeiornis</i>,
<i>Eoenantiornis</i>, <i>Cathayornis</i> and <i>Aberratiodontus</i>. <br>
The illustration would suggest an ulnar sesamoid and three elongate
metacarpals (II-IV), but I ascribe this to the artist instead of the
specimen. The radius is drawn as much more slender than most Mesozoic
birds, and this could be due to artistic inaccuracy as well. The first
metacarpal as illustrated is longer than any other birds except
confuciusornithids. Phalanx I-1 is comparable in length to <i>Jibeinia</i>
and enantiornithine-grade birds (except <i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Longipteryx</i>
and <i>Eoalulavis</i>). Phalanx II-2 is shorter (compared to II-1)
than other coelurosaurs except <i>Jibeinia</i>, <i>Hebeiornis</i>, <i>Cathayornis,
Sinornis</i> and <i>Eocathayornis</i>. Metacarpal III is illustrated
as subequal or barely passing metacarpal II distally, which would be
odd for an enantiornithine-grade bird and more like euornithines and
more basal birds. It may be due to inaccurate illustration. Digit III
seems to only have one phalanx, though I wouldn't be surprised if a
tiny second one were present but not illustrated. This would be unlike <i>Jibeinia</i>
and most more basal birds.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Li et al. assign <i>Dapingfangornis</i> to the
Eoenantiornithiformes because of a short skull, larger nasals and
similar sternum. I disagree. The craniofemoral ratio of <i>Dapingfangornis</i>
is 1.22, while <i>Eoenantiornis</i>' is 1.32. These are longer than <i>Aberratiodontus</i>
(1.07), <i>Hebeiornis</i> (1.05) and <i>Cuspirostrisornis</i> (.99),
but comparable to <i>Cathayornis</i> (1.22) and <i>Sinornis</i>
(1.26). <i>Protopteryx</i> (~1.42), <i>Longipteryx</i> (1.90) and <i>Longirostravis</i>
(1.80) have longer skulls. Even assuming the nasals are correctly
identified in <i>Dapingfangornis</i>, elongate nasals are primitive
for birds. The sterna are not very similar, as noted above. <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
has a more obtuse anterior margin, large distal expansions on the
posterolateral processes (contra Hou et al., 1999), and prominant
posteromedial processes. Li et al. distinguish the genera by <i>Dapingfengornis</i>'
dubious nasal horn, primitive (and overemphasized by taphonomy) sharp
snout, apparently short hypocleidium, and sternal keel (which is
unknown in <i>Eoenantiornis</i> because the sternum is in dorsal view;
contra Hou et al.,1999). <br>

?(PVL-4047) dorsal vertebrae (Chiappe and Calvo, 1994) <br>
?(PVL-4051) six dorsal vertebrae <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Walker and Dyke, 2009) dorsal tuberculum of
humerus strongly projected; mediolateral angle of proximal humerus
slanted; large and deeply excavated pneumatic fossa on proximal end
containing a deep, rounded and wide pneumatic foramen that undercuts
the shaft; pneumatic foramen located distally within fossa; absence of
an olecranon fossa on the caudal face of the distal humerus; condylus
dorsalis bulbous and not angled transversely; absence of a bridge
crossing the caudal portion of the shaft of the coracoid; welldeveloped
and caudally orientated processus lateralis of coracoid; well-developed
and concave sternal facet of coracoid turned somewhat onto the dorsal
face; very large circular foramen nervi supracoracoidei that opens into
the dorsal fossa of the coracoid; external cotyla of ulna deep and
cup-shaped; ulna shorter than humerus; radius two-thirds the width of
the ulna.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- PVL-4022 includes a humerus illustrated by Chiappe and
Walker (2002), though noted (without reference to a specimen number) as
early as Walker (1981) for being unique among Lecho enantiornithines in
having a pneumotricipital foramen. It's an enantiornithine based on-
well-developed fossa on the midline of the proximal humerus making the
articular surface appear V-shaped in proximal view; ventrodistal margin
of humerus projected significantly distal to dorsodistal margin, distal
margin angling strongly ventrally (also in <i>Piksi</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>);
proximoposterior surface of deltopectoral crest concave (also in <i>Confuciusornis</i>,
<i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>); long axis of dorsal condyle
of humerus almost transversely oriented (also in <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>).
Within Enantiornithes, it is derived based on the proximal edge of
humeral head which is centrally concave and the hypertrophied bicipital
crest.<br>
PVL-4041 and 4051 were first reported and commented on by Chiappe and
Calvo (1994), and later illustrated by Chiappe and Walker (2002). Both
of these specimens are Enantiornithes at least as derived as <i>Iberomesornis</i>
due to the centrally located posterior dorsal parapophyses. <br>
PVL-4041-4 is a synsacrum and articulated ilia illustrated by Chiappe
and Walker (2002). The ilia contact over the sacrum, which is otherwise
only known in neognaths (Chiappe and Walker note it may be due to
distortion). However, the ilium does not extend anterior to the sacral
vertebrae, unlike <i>Gansus</i> and Aves. Furthermore, the
postacetabular process is vertically oriented, unlike Carinatae sensu
Chiappe. The presence of eight sacral vertebrae establishes the
specimen as an enantiornithine as derived as <i>Iberomesornis</i> or
an ornithothoracine. <br>

enantiornithine, and was referred to <i>Enantiornis</i> by Walker and
Dyke (2009). PVL-4266 is a proximal humerus photographed by Chiappe
(1996) which was assigned to <i>E. leali</i> by Walker and Dyke. While
PVL-4049 was originally illustrated by Walker (1981) then referred to <i>Enantiornis</i>

tentatively assigned it to <i>Enantiornis leali</i>, but noted it was
anatomically distinct and probably a different taxon. <br>
The proximal ulna PVL-4023 was referred to <i>E. leali</i> by Chiappe
(1996), and later more tentatively referred to the species by Walker
and Dyke (2009). The latter authors find it is larger than other
specimens and differs in the shape of its internal cotyla. As PVL-4043
also differs from <i>E. leali</i> in minor details and is larger, they
are both provisionally listed here in the same species. <br>

<b>Material</b>- ?(PVL-4021-2) fragmentary sternum (Chiappe and Calvo,

?(PVL-4058) distal tarsometatarsus (Chiappe, 1996) <br>
?(PVL-4272) partial coracoid (Walker and Dyke, 2009)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This material was referred to <i>Enantiornis</i> sp.
by Walker (unpublished) and later Walker and Dyke (2009) based on size.
Walker also initially referred the hindlimb material that was later
named <i>Lectavis</i> and <i>Yungavolucris</i> to <i>Enantiornis</i>.
Walker and Dyke (2009) later noted it was likely that <i>Lectavis</i>
is <i>Enantiornis</i> based on size and associations. <br>
PVL-4021-2 is a sternum noted by Chiappe and Calvo (1994) as having
deep posterior notches. It shares the same specimen number with <i>Lectavis</i>,
though Walker (unpublished) considered the association doubtful.<br>
PVL-4042 is a pelvis missing most of the pubis and the distal ischium,
illustrated by Walker (1981) and later Chiappe and Walker (2002) (where
it is mislabeled PVL-4032-3). Walker et al. (2007) stated it was
consistant in size with <i>Enantiornis</i>, which was formalized by
Walker and Dyke (2009). The complete pelvic fusion is more similar to
euornithines than enantiornithines, though the elongate proximodorsal
ischial process is only known in confuciusornithids and
enantiornithines and the <i>m. cuppedicus</i> fossa is unlike
euornithines. The low pointed postacetabular process is a
symplesiomorphy only retained in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> among
euornthines, though found in most enantiornithines (except <i>Gobipteryx</i>).<br>
PVL-4050 and 4057 are mid cervical vertebrae noted by Chiappe (1996)
and Chiappe and Walker (2002) which are avialan due to their
heterocoelous anterior surfaces, but unlike most euornithines (except <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>,
<i>Yixianornis</i>, <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>) in lacking
heterocoelous posterior surfaces. Their centra are highly compressed
tranversely, as in enantiornithines and <i>Ichthyornis</i>. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kurochkin et al., 2013) toothless; upturned

symphysis; acromial process of scapula has medioventral projection for

digit 1 much longer than digit 2.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Several embryos were described by Elzanowski (1981)
and tentatively referred to <i>Gobipteryx minuta</i>. Chatterjee and
Kurochkin (1994) and Kurochkin (1995, 1996) separated ZPAL MgR-I/33 and
two new specimens in the PIN collections from ZPAL MgR-I/34 as a new
taxon of palaeognath. This was to be described in Nature by Chatterjee,
Kurochkin and Mikhailov as "Gobipipus reshetovi" (Mourer-Chauvire,
1995). Indeed, such a reference is cited as a manuscript by Kurochkin
(1996) and Starck and Ricklefs (1998) and "in press" in Nature by
Kurochkin (1995). The name "Gobipipus reshetovi" was published by
Mourer-Chauvire (1995) and later by Chatterjee (1997), though only as
nomina nuda. Ford (www.paleofile.com) lists "Gobipipus elzanowskii" as
a nomen nudum ascribed to Chatterjee in 1994, though the 'Chatterjee,
1994' entry in his bibliography is a miscitation of Chatterjee and
Kurochkin, 1994. That species name has not been published to my
knowledge. By 2000, Kurochkin (2000, 2004) no longer believed the PIN
specimens and ZPAL-MgR-I/33 were a separate taxon from the
enantiornithine specimens. The differences were ascribed to ontogeny.
Kurochkin (2000, 2004) felt these embryos were a new taxon of
enantiornithine which could be distinguished from <i>Gobipteryx</i>
based on several characteristics. The official description was finally
published in 2013 by Kurochkin et al. after Kurochkin's death, though
only the PIN specimens were now referred to the new taxon, with the
rest being retained in <i>Gobipteryx</i>. Kurochkin et al. include <i>Gobipipus</i>
in a version of Clarke's analysis and find it to be a basal
enantiornithine.<br>
The eggs have been named <i>Gobioolithus minor</i> and are
laevisoolithid (Mikhailov, 1996). <br>

<b>Comments</b>- While Chiappe et al. (2001) synonymized <i>Nanantius
valifanovi</i> with <i>Gobipteryx minuta</i>, Kurochkin (2004) kept
them separate and referred IGM 100/1011 to a new species of <i>Nanantius</i>
instead of <i>G. minuta</i>. This was based on an unpublished
character analysis, with only a few supposedly distinguishing
characters listed. <i>N. valifanovi</i> was said to differ from <i>Gobipteryx</i>
in the thin and sharp tomium, dorsal premaxillary groove, and absence
of a ventral symphyseal crest on the dentary. Kurochkin et al. (2013)
later kept the two synonymized, though this was published after
Kurochkin's death so may be Mikhailov's opinion instead.<br>
The eggshells associated with PIN 4492-1 have been assigned to the
ootaxon <i>Subtilioolithus multituberculatus </i> in the
Laevisoolithidae by Mikhailov (1996).<br>
Several embryos were described by Elzanowski (1981), tentatively
referred to <i>Gobipteryx minuta</i> because of several cranial
features. Martin (1983, 1995) and Elzanowski (1995) followed this
assignment. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Jin et al. (2008) reassign <i>Hebeiornis</i>' horizon
to the Qiaotou Member of the Huajiying Formation, as opposed to the
Yixian Formation which was stated in Xu et al. (1999) and Zhang et al.
(2004).<br>
This specimen was initially very briefly described in an obscure paper
as <i>Hebeiorins fengningensis (</i>Xu et al., 1999). They list it as
gen. et sp. nov. and attribute it to Yan, 1999, which I assume to mean
they are the only author (perhaps a mispelling of Yang You-shi?) taking
credit for the name, as opposed to there being a separate Yan, 1999
publication that has not been located. The photograph in Xu et al. is
extremely poor, and only labeled "Bird fossils in the bottom of the
Jurassic Yixian Formation". However, only one Yixian bird specimen is
described there, and the pose described for <i>Hebeiornis</i> is the
same (complete specimen exposed ventrally, neck curving to its left).
In 2006, Mortimer (DML) realized it was a photograph of the holotype of
<i>Vescornis hebeiensis</i>, which was described in detail by Zhang et
al. (2004). The latter taxon was also thought to be from the Yixian
Formation of Senjitsu in Fengning County, though that horizon has
recently been changed (see above). The measurements match fairly well
with <i>Vescornis</i> (skull ~24 vs. 27 mm; scapula ~17 vs. 13 mm;
humerus ~24 vs. 25 mm; ulna ~25 vs. 30 mm; femur ~24 vs. 25 mm; tibia
~30 vs. 30 mm), as do the few osteological details with the exception
of the pygostyle. As Babelfish translates, <i>Hebeiornis</i> "does not
have the tail synthesis bone", while <i>Vescornis</i> has a pygostyle.
Then again, the authors were apparently unfamiliar with the numerous
basal pygostylians with elongate pygostyles (with the exception of <i>Cathayornis</i>,
which they never discuss, only list), so perhaps <i>Vescornis</i>'
elongate pygostyle was too dissimilar to ornithurine sensu Gauthier and
de Queiroz pygostyles for them to count it. Jin et al. (2008) confirm
they are the same specimen, though they regard <i>Hebeiornis</i> as a
nomen nudum. More recently, <i>Hebeiornis</i> has become the accepted
name, being used in several of O'Connor's publications.<br>
One issue is that the only time <i>Hebeiornis</i> is used in Xu et
al.'s (1999) paper, it is misspelled <i>Hebeiorins</i>. However, ICZN
Article 32.5.1 states "If there is in the original publication itself,
without recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence
of an inadvertent error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist's or
printer's error, it must be corrected." Xu et al. say "<i>Hebeiorins
fengningensis</i> Yan 1999 (gen et sp nov), namely Hebei Fengning bird
(new genus and new species)." Since the suffix for "bird" is "-ornis"
not "-orins", and the difference is a simple switching of n and i, that
seems to be clear evidence of a lapsus calami. Even if this were not
the case, it would still be correct to use <i>Hebeiornis</i>. Several
publications have since used <i>Hebeiornis</i>, but only one I know of
has used <i>Hebeiorins</i> (Ji et al., 2008). If <i>Hebeiorins</i>
was the correct original spelling, the uses of <i>Hebeiornis</i> would
be incorrect subsequent spellings. These are defined by ICZN Article
33.3 as "any subsequent spelling of a name different from the correct
original spelling, other than a mandatory change or an emendation".
Article 33.3.1 states "when an incorrect subsequent spelling is in
prevailing usage and is attributed to the publication of the original
spelling, the subsequent spelling and attribution are to be preserved
and the spelling is deemed to be a correct original spelling." Since <i>Hebeiornis</i>
is in prevailing usage and attributed to Xu et al., it's deemed to be
the correct original spelling.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zelenkov and Averianov, 2015) prenarial
portion of premaxilla low with subparallel dorsal and ventral margins;
dentary with widely spaced, small teeth; at least one cervical vertebra
with most anterior part of prezygapophyseal articular surface facing
ventrally; posterior surface of distal tibia with laterally located
robust crest; metatarsus at least eight times longer than wide
proximally.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Fragmentary manual elements were identified as distal
metacarpals II and III and an incomplete II-1 by Zelenkov and Averianov
(2015), but in my opinion the supposed metacarpals look more similar to
a broken II-1, with the supposed II-1 being II-2. The authors stated
"poor preservation of this area precludes equivocal interpretation of
these bone fragments", which I agree with. <br>
The specimen was discovered in 1977 and initially identified as a bird
by Kurochkin (1979) before he misidentified it as a pterosaur. It was
first published by Kurochkin (1991), who included a photo of the
specimen with the caption "Part of the skeleton of a tiny pterosaur
(Mongolia). Bone surrounded [by] convert organic matter to the side
[that] shows two fingerprint feathers. Original." Next to the slab in
the photo is a card with "Holbotia ponomarenkoi Kurochkin, 1982"
written on it. Kurochkin (1993) later reidentified the specimen as a
bird in his thesis, as did Unwin (1993). Unwin was the first author to
publish the name<i> Holbotia ponomarenkoi</i> in text, and identified
it as probably ambiortid and possibly <i>Ambiortus</i>, though further
study has shown this to be untrue (Kurochkin, 1995a; etc.). Kurochkin
(1994) mentions the Early Cretaceous "Mongolian Kholbotiaka" as an
enantiornithine, but this is a literal translation from Cyrillic and
not a newly proposed genus name. Kurochkin (1995a, b; 1996; 2000) and
Bakhurina and Unwin (1995) provided further details of <i>Holbotia</i>
as an enantiornithine similar to other Early Cretaceous taxa. Note
however, that Bakhurina and Unwin were incorrect in stating <i>Holbotia</i>
has subequal tarsometatarsus and tibiotarsus (actual ratio ~68%) and
penultimate pedal phalanges "no longer than any of the preceding
phalanges" (at least phalanx III-3 is longer than III-2). Also contra
Kurochkin (1996), no coracoid is preserved. More recently, Zelenkov and
Averianov (2014) discuss the specimen in an abstract, misspelling the
genus as 'Holobotia'. The official description appeared the following
year, with Zelenkov and Averianov (2015) finding <i>Holbotia</i> to be
most closely related to <i>Neuquenornis</i>, <i>Concornis</i> and <i>Qiliania</i>
using O'Connor's bird matrix.<br>

?(IVPP V10904) gastralia, tibiotarsi (34.5 mm), fibula, tarsometatarsi
(19 mm), pedal phalanges, pedal unguals (8 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang and Liu, 2016) pygostyle longer than
tarsometatarsus; sternum with anterior spine and concave costal margin;
posterolateral process with large fan-shaped distal expansion; pubic
peduncle of ilium well developed and approaching ischiadic peduncle in
length; pubic peduncle strongly posteriorly directed; postacetabular
process weakly curved ventrally; distal ends of metatarsals II and III
deflected medially; metatarsal IV trochlea less than half width
metatarsal III trochlea.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hou (1997) included several characters in <i>caudatus</i>'
diagnosis which are problematic. The supposed transverse trough lying
between the frontal and parietal is either an area where the bone has
broken away or due to disarticulation of those elements. A minimum of
three pairs of dentary teeth, "relatively well developed" sternal
carina, and elongated tarsometatarsus that exceeds half tibiotarsal
length are true of most enantiornithines. Hou's interpretation of the
caudal vertebrae as unfused is due to misidentifying the partial left
femur as the caudal series, as detailed by Wang and Liu (2016).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1993 and described by
Hou (1997) as a new species of <i>Cathayornis</i> based on numerous
symplesiomorphies. O'Connor and Dyke (2010) identified the pygostyle,
viewing Hou's supposed string of unfused caudal vertebrae as the left
pubis. They considered the species a nomen dubium pending further
study. Wang and Liu (2016) performed that study, finding <i>caudatus</i>
to be valid though not necessarily closely related to <i>Cathayornis</i>.
Thus they placed it in a new genus <i>Houornis</i>. Their
redescription could not verify the presence of dorsal vertebrae, sacral
vertebrae or scapula, and found the supposed caudal series was actually
the left femur. The supplementary information includes a NEXUS file
with the OTU "Similicaudipteryx caudatus", seemingly an earlier idea
for the genus name. Their figured cladogram does not place <i>Houornis</i>
more precisely than Enantiornithes more derived that <i>Protopteryx</i>
and <i>Iberomesornis</i>, and excluded from derived longipterygids and
bohaiornithids, though this may be due to including the fragmentary <i>Parvavis</i>
and OFMB-3. Wang and Liu confirmed the referral of IVPP V10533 to <i>Houornis</i>
based on tarsometatarsal characters, but they did not mention IVPP
V10904 which was also referred to the taxon by Hou. While the
deflection of metatarsal III is ambiguous in Hou's figure, metatarsal
IV does seem to be comparably narrow. It is provisionally retained as <i>Houornis</i>
here pending further study.<br>

<strong>Diagnosis-</strong> (after Wang et al., 2024) combination of- edentulous rostrum; postdentary bones fused forming compound element that is dorsally concave and ventrally convex; pygostyle with convex ventrolateral processes; furcula with hook-like acromial (epicleidal) processes; humerus with a well-developed, anteriorly-protruding bicipital crest; humerus with&nbsp;well-developed deltopectoral crest; elongate olecranon&nbsp;process of  ulna;   short pedal phalanx III-1 (79% the length of phalanx III-2).<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>- The holotype was donated to the STM by an amateur collector.&nbsp;The element identified as right pedal phalanx IV-1 is more likely III-3 since a shorter and thinner phalanx IV-1 is present under IV-2.&nbsp; Wang et al. claim the left pes is only &quot;missing phalanges of digit II, and unguals of digits II-IV&quot;, but a complete digit II including ungual is present, while phalanx III-3 is missing, as is the elongate phalanx IV-4.&nbsp; <br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP collection; lost) (juvenile) partial skull,
mandible (22 mm), six cervical vertebrae (~2.4 mm), five dorsal
vertebrae (~2.9 m), dorsal ribs, gastralia, sacrum, six caudal
vertebrae, pygostyle (13 mm), scapula (20 mm), coracoids (11.5 mm),
incomplete furcula, sternum (17 mm), humerus (23.3 mm), radius (24.2
mm), ulna (24 mm), semilunate carpal, pisiform, metacarpal I (2 mm),
phalanx I-1 (4 mm), manual ungual I (2.5 mm), metacarpal II (9.3 mm),
phalanx II-1 (6 mm), phalanx II-2 (3.7 mm), manual ungual II (2.1 mm),
metacarpal III (8.3 mm), phalanx III-1 (1.5 mm), phalanx III-2 (2.9
mm), manual ungual III (1 mm), partial ilium, pubis (21 mm), partial
ischium, femora (22.2 mm), tibiae (28 mm), astragali, calcanea, distal
tarsal, metatarsal I, phalanx I-1, pedal ungual I, metatarsal II,
phalanx II-1, phalanx II-2, pedal ungual II, metatarsal III (16.3 mm),
phalanx III-1, phalanx III-2, proximal phalanx III-3, pedal ungual III,
metatarsal IV, phalanx IV-1, phalanx IV-2, phalanx IV-3, phalanx IV-4,
pedal ungual IV, feather impressions <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- narrow furcular branches; metacarpal II does not
extend past metacarpal II (?); three phalanges on manual digit III (?);
trochlea of metatarsal II not wider than that of metatarsal III (?).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of the diagnostic characters listed by Hou
(1997), most are symplesiomorphic for enantiornithines (numerous
unserrated maxillary teeth; large, broad sternum; reduced manual digit
III; fused pubic symphysis; metatarsals partially fused proximally and
unfused distally; metatarsal II shorter than metatarsal III or IV) or
ambiguous (extremely concave cervical centra; unexpanded distal pubes).
The narrow posteromedian sternal process is present in almost all
enantiornithines as derived as <i>Longipteryx</i>, while the final
character (poorly developed posterolateral sternal processes) is
problematic. The distal end of the right process is covered by another
element, while the right process has a broader base which may be the
remains of a large distal expansion. If the right side is more
accurate, it would resemble <i>Hebeiornis</i>, while the left side
could resemble <i>Eoenantiornis</i>. Another possibility is that the
sternum is similar to <i>Cathayornis</i> in possessing a small
anterolateral process on the right side, with most of the
posterolateral process broken off. Interestingly, if manual phalanx
III-1 is actually a broken piece of metacarpal III, both the apparently
short metacarpal III and presence of three phalanges on that digit
would be resolved and the manus would resemble those of other
enantiornithines. Hou previously claims <i>Confuciusornis</i> has five
phalanges on manual digit III in the same book (again probably due to a
broken element), so such a mistake by him would not be unheard of. It
would still have two phalanges on the digit however, which would be
like basal enantiornithines but unlike some derived taxa.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The name "Jibeinia luanhera" was first used in Hou
(1997), but only in the captions of three illustrations. In the text,
it was merely called Ji Bei bird (this is untrue in the English
translation). Because the scientific name was not given in the text
itself, "Jibeinia" was a nomen nudum. Later, Hou (2000) used the
scientific name in the text of his semipopular Picture Book of Chinese
Fossil Birds, with accompanying illustrations and disgnosis. This
counts as the first official use of the name. Unfortunately, neither
work contains trustworthy descriptions or accurate illustrations. The
illustrations in Hou (1997) are hopelessly schematic, while the
skeletal reconstructions in Hou (2000) aren't respresentative of bird
anatomy, let alone that of <i>Jibeinia</i> itself. Hou's (1997)
descriptions contain features not known in birds (e.g. septomaxillae,
presternae) as well as numerous characters which clash with those
described in more recent and better illustrated papers (e.g. <i>Confuciusornis</i>
in Chiappe et al., 1999). In addition, the holotype is presently lost
(Hou pers. comm., 2001 to Zhang et al., 2004) and existing casts are of
low quality. Thus all morphological details of <i>Jibeinia</i> are
suspect, except the few which can be gleaned from published photographs.<br>
Jin et al. (2008) reassign <i>Jibeinia</i>'s horizon to the Qiaotou
Member of the Huajiying Formation, as opposed to the Yixian Formation
which was stated in Hou (1997) and Zhang et al. (2004).<br>
Based on comparison with undoubted juvenile enantiornithines (<i>Dalingheornis</i>,
<i>Liaoxiornis</i>, GMV 2158, GMV 2159, etc.), <i>Jibeinia</i> is near
certainly a juvenile as well. Characters supporting this conclusion
include- unfused sacrum; sternal keel absent; high interclavicular
angle; humeral head not concave proximally; humeral distal condyles
undeveloped, which in turn causes the ventral condyle to not project
distally; carpometacarpus fusion absent; pelvic fusion absent; cnemial
crest absent; tibiotarsal, proximal tarsal and distal tarsal fusion
absent. Some of these characters are seen in most of the taxa described
by Hou (1997), so may be due to the schematic illustration quality or
incorrect description instead. <br>
<i>Jibeinia</i> exhibits several primitive characters for an
ornithothoracine. It supposedly lacks a sternal keel, has three
phalanges on manual digit III, and a metacarpal I which is unfused to
the carpometacarpus. In addition, the unfused carpometacarpus and
pelvis, absent cnemial crest and unfused tibiotarsus and tarsus are all
near certainly juvenile characters, being more primitive than more
basal avebrevicaudans like <i>Sapeornis</i> and <i>Confuciusornis</i>.
However, <i>Jibeinia</i> exhibits a narrower interclavicular angle
(~66 degrees) and less phalanges on manual digit III than
confuciusornithids and most more basal maniraptorans. Because <i>Jibeinia</i>
is probably a juvenile, it is unclear if some characters it possesses
are due to being juvenile or being basal. The posteromedian sternal
process is narrow as in enantiornithines, but the ventral humeral
condyle doesn't appear to be distally projected, if the illustration
can be trusted. The latter is the juvenile condition for
enantiornithines, however. Metatarsal IV is reduced in width as in
enantiornithines. <br>
Zhang et al. (2004) suggested <i>Jibeinia</i> may be a senior synonym
of <i>Hebeiornis</i> (described by those authors as <i>Vescornis</i>),
which they described from the same formation. This was based on their
identical size and numerous similar characteristics. Besides those
characters listed in the diagnosis, <i>Jibeinia</i> differs from <i>Hebeiornis</i>
in- more shallow anterior dentary; elongate posteromedial sternal
processes; narrow ventral tubercle of humerus; larger manual ungual I. <i>Jibeinia</i>
supposedly has amphicoelous cervicals and dorsals, while <i>Hebeiornis</i>
has heterocoelous cervicals and an opisthocoelous dorsal (but note the
comment above regarding enantiornithine central articulations). Besides
the numerous juvenile characters listed above (some of which <i>Hebeiornis</i>
shows as well- unfused sacrum, metacarpal I unfused to carpometacarpus,
proximal tarsals unfused to tibia), <i>Jibeinia</i> is younger based
on supposed foramina between neural arches in the pygostyle, and its
undeveloped distal femoral condyles. Based on comparison to <i>Hebeiornis</i>,
the proximal coracoid of <i>Jibeinia</i> may be broken off, though Hou
does describe it as having a rounded head. If it is complete, it is
shorter than in <i>Hebeiornis</i>. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1998 or 1999, the part and counterpart
of <i>Liaoxiornis</i> were obtained by different museums and described
as different taxa. Hou and Chen (1999a,b) of the NIGP (and IVPP)
described the part as <i>Liaoxiornis delicatus</i> in early February
1999 (English version appeared in May). Ji and Ji (1999) of the GMV
described the counterpart as <i>Lingyuanornis parvus</i> in March
1999. Harris (pers. comm. 2001 to Mortimer (online, 2001) discovered
the specimens were from the same individual, while Creisler (online
2001) determined the nomenclatural priority. While at least Hou and
Chen viewed <i>Liaoxiornis</i> as an adult, it is clearly a juvenile
as confirmed by Chiappe and Ji (2002) and Chiappe et al. (2007). The
latter authors argue the holotype is indeterminate and that the name <i>Liaoxiornis
delicatus</i> "should be abandoned", placing it in quotes. Yet the
taxon is valid under the ICZN and cannot simply be disappeared
regardless of how diagnostic its holotype is. Similarly, O'Connor's
(2009) claim the taxon is a nomen nudum is incorrect, as it was
properly established under ICZN rules.<br>

STM19-8 to O'Connor's matrix which they referenced as referring to <span style="font-style: italic;">Linyiornis</span>.  The scores are

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Walker et al. (2007) note numerous characters
which they correctly state are shared with other enantiornithines-
proximal margin of humerus concave in its central portion, rising both
ventrally and dorsally on either side; bicipital crest prominent;
ventral surface of bicipital crest bearing a small fossa for muscle
attachment; proximally L-shaped humeral head; well-marked depression
underneath the proximal head of the humerus; weakly developed distal
condyles; flat distal end that is not deflected dorsally. They also
list many characters intended to be apomorphies of <i>Martinavis</i>.
The pneumotricipital fossa is no wider in <i>vincei</i>, <i>saltariensis</i>
or <i>minor</i> than <i>Elbretornis, Enantiornis, Gurilynia,
Halimornis</i> or <i>Otogornis</i>, and is narrow in <i>cruzyensis</i>
and <i>whetstonei</i>. It is wide in the American specimen KU-NM-37
though. The lack of a perforated ventral tubercle is plesiomorphic and
also present in such taxa as <i>Halimornis</i> and <i>Eoalulavis</i>.
Most enantiornithine deltopectoral crests could be described as "flat
and broad", while the stated lack of ventral curvature in the crest is
difficult to understand since it projects dorsally in enantiornithines.
The lack of a marked distal angle between the deltopectoral crest and
shaft distally is primitive and also seen in such taxa as <i>Eoalulavis,
Eocathayornis, Hebeiornis, Otogornis, Pengornis</i> and <i>Cathayornis</i>,
but is absent in <i>saltariensis</i> and not determinable in KU-NM-37.
The bicipital crest in <i>cruzyensis</i> and <i>vincei</i> is no
smaller than in <i>Gurilynia</i>, while KU-NM-37, <i>minor</i>, <i>saltariensis</i>
and <i>whetstonei</i> have large crests. The bicipital crest is indeed
more anteriorly angled in <i>vincei</i> and KU-NM-37 than <i>Elbretornis,
Enantiornis, Halimornis</i> or <i>Gurilynia</i>, but is less angled
than <i>Elsornis</i>. Supposed <i>Martinavis</i> species <i>minor</i>,
<i>saltariensis</i> and <i>whetstonei</i> have less angled crests. The
condition in <i>cruzyensis</i> is not illustrated, though stated to be
less than vincei at least. "Ventral margin of bicipital crest small" is
a confusing statement, and the ventrally placed bicipital fossa is also
present in <i>Elbretornis</i>, <i>Gurilynia</i> and <i>Halimornis</i>
while those of <i>M. cruzyensis</i>, <i>saltariensis</i> and <i>minor</i>
are anteroventrally placed. The ventral condyle is as poorly developed
in <i>Elbretornis, Elsornis, Eocathayornis, Kizylkumavis</i> and <i>Cathayornis</i>.
Note neither this nor the next three characters can be evaluated in <i>minor</i>,
<i>whetstonei</i> or KU-NM-37. <i>Alexornis, Elbretornis, Elsornis,
Kizylkumavis</i> and <i>Otogornis</i> lack both scapulotricipital and
humerotricipital grooves as well. The ventral epicondyle is as large
and distally projected in <i>Kizylkumavis</i> and probably <i>Alexornis</i>.
A transversely oriented dorsal condyle is present in almost all
enantiornithines, even <i>Elbretornis</i> (contra Walker and Dyke).
Walker et al. also included a differential diagnosis, though it repeats
some characters of the general diagnosis (anteriorly angled bicipital
crest; deltopectoral crest smoothly angled; transversely oriented
dorsal condyle) and has another which contradicts the general diagnosis
(small entepicondyle). Of the remaining characters, the shaft is
actually less gracile than <i>Enantiornis</i> (and most other
enantiornithines), not more. A laterally positioned ectepicondyle is
present in all enantiornithines. Walker and Dyke do not add further
characters to the diagnosis.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Walker et al. (2007) established this genus for
several large humeri from the Late Cretaceous of Argentina (<i>M. vincei</i>,
PVL-4025, 4028 and 4046), France (<i>M. cruzyensis</i>) and the US
(KU-NM-37). Walker and Dyke (2009) later named PVL-4025 <i>M.
saltariensis</i>, PVL-4028 <i>M. whetstonei</i> and PVL-4046 <i>M.
minor</i>. However, as seen above, none of these specimens share unique
apomorphies. In fact, <i>M. cruzyensis</i> lacks two of the supposed <i>Martinavis</i>
synapomorphies, <i> saltariensis</i> lacks four, both <i>minor</i>
and <i>whetstonei</i> lack at least three, and the American specimen
lacks at least one. Walker and Dyke refer numerous additional
postcranial elements to <i>Martinavis sp.</i> based on size
(PVL-4030-4032, 4034, 4036-4038, 4044, 4049, 4056, 4060 and tentatively
4273), but since there's no evidence that genus was present in
Argentina, it seems best to keep these as Enantiornithes indet..<br>

<b>Comments</b>- PVL-4025 is a humerus first photographed as
Enantiornithes by Chiappe (1996), and later illustrated by Chiappe and
Walker (2002). Walker et al. (2007) assigned it to <i>Martinavis sp.</i>
and it was later made the holotype of <i>Martinavis saltariensis</i>
by Walker and Dyke (2009). However, <i>saltariensis</i> does not have
some supposed <i>Martinavis</i> characters listed by Walker et al.
(deltopectoral crest merges smoothly into shaft; bicipital crest small
and anteriorly angled; large ventral epicondyle), and there are no
characters which it uniquely shares with <i>M. cruzyensis</i> and/or <i>vincei</i>.
It seems best to keep this species out of <i>Martinavis</i>, and it
could be named as a new genus. Based on size, it may belong to <i>Soroavisaurus</i>.

<b>Comments</b>- PVL-4054 was first illustrated by Walker (1981) and

Chiappe (1996) listed PVL-4059 as Enantiornithines and it was later
made the paratype of <i>M. vincei</i>. However, as noted the the Other
diagnoses of <i>Martinavis</i>, none of Walker et al.'s supposed
apomorphies for that genus are valid. This makes referring <i>vincei</i>
to it problematic and indeed it resembles <i>Gurilynia</i> and <i>Halimornis</i>
more than <i>Martinavis</i> in having a broad pneumotricipital fossa
and ventrally placed bicipital fossa. Based on size, it may belong to <i>Soroavisaurus</i>.

<b>Comments</b>- Originally identified as an enantiornithine by Dong
(1994), Hou (1994) later named the specimen and placed it as a basal
enantiornithine. Kurochkin (1999) believed the taxon to be a
palaeognath related to <i>Ambiortus</i> instead, assigning both to the
Ambiortiformes.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (STM V001) (subadult) several dorsal vertebrae,
partial dorsal ribs, gastralia, pygostyle (12.9 mm), scapula (17.9 mm),
coracoids (12.8 mm), partial sternum, sternal rib, incomplete humeri
(22.6 mm), radii, ulnae (23.5 mm), scapholunares, pisiforms,
carpometacarpi (11.5 mm), manual phalanx I-1 (2.9 mm), manual ungual I,
phalanx II-1 (5.5 mm), phalanx II-2 (3.5 mm), manual ungual II,
phalanges III-1 (2.9 mm), phalanx III-2, manual claw sheath, incomplete
femur (22.2 mm), tibiae (one partial; 26.3 mm), astragalocalcanea,
metatarsals I, phalanges I-1, pedal unguals I, tarsometatarsi (15.7
mm), phalanges II-1, phalanges II-2, pedal unguals II, phalanx III-1,
phalanx III-2, phalanx III-3, pedal ungual III, phalanges IV-1,
phalanges IV-2, phalanges IV-3, phalanges IV-4, pedal unguals IV,
remiges, retrices, body feathers<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zheng et al. (2007) list numerous additional
characters in their diagnosis. The scapula is no longer (79%) than
several other enantiornithines including the contemporaneous <i>Jibeinia</i>
(86%). The elongation of the coracoid (length 2.37 times distal width,
not 2.5 times as listed in the diagnosis) is very similar to <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
(2.34) and in any case is intermediate between ratios in other
enantiornithines. The authors state the furcula has two distinguishing
features- an interclavicular angle of less than 40 degrees and a highly
elongate hypocleideum (three-fourths of clavicular branch length).
However, plate II shows that the supposed clavicular branches of the
furcula are dorsal ribs while the illustrated hypocleidium is nowhere
to be found in the photograph. This would explain the unusually slender
clavicular branches in the illustration. The posteromedial sternal
process is said to be longer and more robust than the posterolateral
process, but the photograph indicates the supposed posterolateral
process is probably a sternal rib instead. This leaves the supposed
posteromedial process as the posterolateral process while the real
posteromedial process is unpreserved with most of the posterior
sternum. Manual ungual I is said to be larger than ungual II, but this
seems to be merely due to the preserved keratinous sheath on ungual I,
though larger manual ungual I's are known in some enantiornithines
(e.g. <i>Jibeinia</i>). The length of manual digit I (76%- as measured
from the base of the carpometacarpus to the tip of phalanx I-1 compared
to the length of the semilunate carpal plus metacarpal II) is very
similar to <i>Jibeinia</i> (71%) and especially <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
(76%). Metacarpal III being more slender than metacarpal II is found in
most theropods. Manual phalanx II-2 being shorter than II-1 is present
in many derived enantiornithines. The carpometacarpus being only fused
proximally is true in most enantiornithines. The unfused tibiotarsus is
probably ontogenetic and is known in the young holotypes of other
enantiornithines (<i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Rapaxavis</i>, <i>Dalingheornis</i>,
<i>Jibeinia</i>). Strong, curved pedal unguals and a long pygostyle are
present in most enantiornithines. Finally, two pairs of elongate
retrices are known in <i>Shanweiniao</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- While Zheng et al. (2007) refer <i>Paraprotopteryx</i>
to the Liaoning Formation of Fengning, they also state <i>Protopteryx</i>,
<i>Jibeinia</i> and <i>Vescornis</i> (= <i>Hebeiornis</i>) are from
this locality. Jin et al. (2008) reassigned it to the Qiaotou Member of
the Huajiying Formation. Zheng et al. state the skull "seems not to be
the same individual as the postcranial bones after careful
examination", and the portion of the slab containing the skull and
cervical vertebrae does seem to contain an additional left coracoid.<br>
Zheng et al. stated <i>Paraprotopteryx</i> was most similar to <i>Protopteryx</i>
due to several characters. Of these, the unfused tibiotarsus is
probably ontogenetic while the carpometacarpus is not unfused in <i>Paraprotopteryx</i>.
Elongate paired retrices are also known in <i>Jibeinia</i>, <i>Longirostravis</i>,
<i>Shanweiniao</i> and <i>Dapingfangornis</i> and seem standard for
enantiornithines. The shared character of "complete manual claws"
probably refers to the presence of two phalanges on digit III, which is
seen in all basal enantiornithines including <i>Pengornis</i>, <i>Jibeinia</i>,
<i>Longipteryx</i>, <i>Longirostravis</i>, <i>Rapaxavis</i> and <i>Eocathayornis</i>.

<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP V20729) (adult) partial skull, sclerotic
ossicles, incomplete mandible, atlas, axis, six postaxial cervical
vertebrae, seven dorsal vertebrae, dorsal ribs, synsacrum, six caudal
vertebrae, pygostyle (12.3 mm), scapulae, coracoids (15.9 mm),

tibiotarsi (28.6 mm), fibulae (12.2 mm), metatarsals I, tarsometatarsi
(mtII 15.1, mtIII 17, mtIV 15.6 mm), fifteen pedal phalanges, six pedal
unguals<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang et al., 2015) proximal half of coracoid
shaft curved medially (also in <i>Cathayornis</i> and <i>Eocathayornis</i>);
sternum with external anteromedian spine (possibly external spine also
in <i>Eocathayornis</i> and <i>Houornis</i>); sternum with
anterolateral processes (also in <i>Rapaxavis</i> and <i>Concornis</i>);
metatarsal II strongly ginglymoid articulation; wide articular furrow
on plantar surface of metatarsal II.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Wang et al. also view the surangular as
diagnostic, proposing it has an anteroventrally sloping anterior
margin. Yet this would be unlike almost all other theropods, and not
match the slope of the dentary (Wang et al. propose they form an
autapomorphic overlapping articulation). Note the supposed angular is
continuous posteriorly with the surangular, flaring at its posterior
end. These facts make it more likely the surangular is a left element
in medial view and that the 'angular' is the ridge dorsal to the
Meckelian fossa, comparable to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. The authors also
propose the distally fused first and second metacarpals to be unique
among Early Cretaceous enantiornithines, but correctly note the
condition is present in several Late Cretaceous members of that group.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The name "Dispersusia" is used and bolded in Wang et
al.'s cladogram, no doubt an earlier name for <i>Pterygornis</i> in
reference to the dispersed elements of the holotype. Wang et al.
entered <i>Pterygornis</i> into a version of O'Connor's bird matrix
and found it to be more derived than longipterygids, in a position just
closer to avisaurids than to bohaiornithids.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This specimen is the most complete of four juvenile
birds found associated in a theropod or pterosaur pellet. It was only
identified as a bird by Sanz et al. (2001), and colored dark gray in
their illustration. The strut-like coracoid and tapered distal scapula
are like avialans (though confuciusornithids reverse the latter). The
fused sterna are similar to euavialans, though its small size and lack
of lateral processes are no doubt due to its young age, as seen in
juvenile enantiornithines and confuciusornithids. Several characters
are unlike most euornithines, but similar to enantiornithines and more
basal birds. The absent procoracoid process is only found in <i>Patagopteryx</i>
and <i>Apsaravis</i>. The scapula being shorter than the humerus is
only found in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>.
The medial tibiotarsal condyle being wider than the lateral one is only
seen in <i>Patagopteryx</i>. Finally, the proximal end of metatarsal
III is in the same plane as metatarsals II and IV, which is only seen
in <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i>
among euornithines. Other characters are shared only with
enantiornithines with a few exceptions. The deep dorsal coracoid fossa
and narrow tibiotarsal intercondylar groove (~25% of tibiotarsal width)
are only present in enantiornithines and <i>Apsaravis</i>. The narrow
sternal xiphoid process is only present in enantiornithines and <i>Hongshanornis</i>.
Metatarsal IV being so narrow compared to II and III is uniquely
enantionithine. Within Enantiornithes, the specimen may be more derived
than <i>Protopteryx</i>, <i>Longipteryx</i> and <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
based on its short manual digit I. The sternal xiphoid process is
distally expanded as in <i>Longirostravis</i>, <i>Shanweiniao</i>, <i>Eocathayornis</i>,
<i>Eoalulavis</i> and <i>Liaoningornis</i>. Yet metatarsal II has a
trochlea smaller than III, which among enantiornithines is only known
in longipterygids, <i>Vorona</i> and <i>Liaoningornis</i>. It may be
most closely related to <i>Vorona</i>, <i>Liaoningornis</i>, or <i>Shanweiniao</i>
and <i>Longirostravis</i>. <br>

Material</b>- (Mechin coll. no. 606) tibiotarsus (132 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Buffetaut et al. (2000) referred this specimen to
Enantiornithes incertae sedis. The reduced fibula indicates this is an
avialan, while the tubercle on the ascending process is a pygostylian
character. Although uncommon, lack of fusion between the
astragalocalcaneum and tibia is known in some pygostylians (e.g. <i>Longipteryx</i>,
<i>Hebeiornis</i>, <i>Gobipteryx</i>, <i>Vorona</i>) and may be
ontogenetic. The lack of medially tapering distal condyles and narrow
intercondylar groove are seen in most enantiornithines, but also the
basal euornithines <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Longicrusavis</i>. The
large medial condyle (~200% the width of the lateral one) is
characteristic of a subset of enantiornithines, including <i>Nanantius</i>,
<i>Gobipteryx</i> and <i>Soroavisaurus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1979, this was identified as an

enantiornithiform by Nesov (1984a,b, 1992). Kurochkin (1996) referred
it to Alexornithidae within Enantiornithes. This was based on the
strongly reduced metatarsal IV, which however seems to characterize
most enantiornithines except for <i>Aberratiodontus</i>, <i>Iberomesornis</i>,
<i>Liaoningornis</i> and <i>Vorona</i>. The extremely enlarged medial
tibiotarsal condyle (based on the tarsometatarsal cotyla it was ~225%
the width of the lateral condyle) is characteristic of a derived set of
enantiornithines including <i>Gobipteryx</i>, <i>Nanantius</i> and <i>Soroavisaurus</i>
though.<br>

<i>Sinornis</i>), though it is also present in several other
enantiornithines (e.g. <i>Eoalulavis</i>, <i>Fortunguavis</i>, <i>Longusunguis</i>,
<i>Noguerornis</i>, <i>Parabohaiornis</i>, <i>Rapaxavis</i>, <i>Shenqiornis</i>,

(after Clark et al., 2024) combination of- robust tarsometatarsus (width at  midpoint at least 20% that of total  length); mediolaterally broad trochlea of metatarsal II relative to III; presence of hypertrophied  tibialis cranialis tubercle on metatarsal II; m. tibialis cranialis tubercle located at least 20% down the length of tarsometatarsus from proximal margin; well-developed plantar projection of medial margin of  metatarsal III trochlea<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>-Brett-Surman and Paul (1985) initially assigned avisaurids to non-bird Theropoda because the tarsometatarsi of <em>Avisaurus</em> and the then-unnamed <em>Soroavisaurus</em> &quot;are more like those of theropods than of birds&quot;, using criteria for 'bird-like' that are now known to define clades within Euornithes (distal to proximal fusion, subarctometatarsaly, well developed hypotarsus) although avisaurids do possess the avian states of their other two characters (&quot;Foramen present between metatarsals III &amp; IV&quot;, complete fusion of distal tarsals to metatarsus).&nbsp; They concluded it was &quot;impossible to ascertain the exact position of <em>Avisaurus</em> vis-a-vis other theropod infraorders at this time&quot;, although they suggested the proximally uncompressed metatarsal III was unlike avetheropods, the posteriorly concave cross section &quot;is strongly reminiscent of derived theropods, especially <em>Elmisaurus</em>, and to a lesser degree tyrannosaurids, ornithomimids, dromaeosaurs and <em>Archaeopteryx</em>&quot; and &quot;the fusion of the proximal articular facets into a smooth continuous surface with derived theropods.&quot;&nbsp; The proximally broad metatarsal III is now known to be an avebrevicaudan reversal even retained in some basal euornithines like <em>Archaeorhynchus</em>.&nbsp; Brett-Surman and Paul did write &quot;It is possible that these metatarsi are those of enantiornithids, and that the enantiornithids represent a sister group to other birds that retain a theropod-like foot&quot;, which turned out to be the case, but rejected it because they are &quot;morphologically distinct from the described enantiornithid metatarsus (UNT 4053.&quot;&nbsp; This was later made the holotype of <em>Yungavolucris</em>, and the authors also label what would become the holotype of <em>Lectavis</em> &quot;Enantiornithes&quot; in Figure 2I, both taxa now known to have tarsometatarsi highly divergent from most enentiornithines.<br>
Clark et al. (2024) restrict Avisauridae to <em>Soroavisaurus</em>, <em>Gettyia</em>, <em>Mirarce</em> and <em>Avisaurus</em> based on their supposed majority rule consensus tree using O'Connor's bird matrix, which has these in a clade excluding <em>Neuquenornis</em>, <em>Intiornis</em>, <em>Magnusavis</em> and other taxa.&nbsp; However, majority rule trees do not necessarily even show clades recovered in MPTs and the actual majority rule consensus does not even have this clade.&nbsp; They do not define it in any case, and using Chiappe's long-standing definition including <em>Neuquenornis</em>, Clark et al.'s actual results recover <em>Intiornis</em> and <em>Magnusavis</em> as avisaurids, <em>Mystiornis</em> outside the clade and place <em>Elsornis</em>, <em>Halimornis</em> and <em>Shenqiornis</em> ambiguously.<br>

<strong>Comments</strong>- This was discovered in 2022 or 2023 (Clark, pers. comm. 11-2024).&nbsp; Note the species name is spelled <em>ekalakaenis</em> four times in Clark et al.'s (2024) paper, including where it establishes &quot;gen. et sp. nov.&quot;, but Clark confirms <em>ekalakaensis</em> is the intended spelling (pers. comm., 11-2024) which is also the only one established under ICZN Article 8.5.3 at ZooBank (a name must &quot;be registered in the <em>Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature</em> (ZooBank)).&quot;&nbsp; Regarding the pedal phalanx, Clark et al. note &quot;Though digit assignment of the phalanx is uncertain, it resembles the first phalanx of pedal digit II in <em>Mirarce</em>.&quot;<br>
Clark et al.

The holotype was discovered on July 24 1975, and according to Brett-Surman and Paul (1985) &quot;was initially called dinosaurian by neoornithologists but avian by most dinosaur paleontologists!&quot; (see discussion under Avisauridae).&nbsp; Glut (1982) notes
Brett-Surman proposed this and an Argentinian form (presumably what
would be later named <span style="font-style: italic;">Soroavisaurus</span>)
as a new theropod family
at the 1978 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting. 
Clark et al. (2024) estimated its mass.&nbsp; Brett-Surman and Paul (1985) also designated PVL-4690 and PVL-4048 as
paratypes, but they were later made the holotype and paratype
respectively of <i>Soroavisaurus australis</i> (Chiappe, 1993). The paratype was discovered on May 5 1949 but has never been commented on (besides Paul and Brett-Surman saying it &quot;shows the distal ends of the metatarsals were unfused, but proximally it has a very strong rugose suture for metatarsal II&quot;) or figured, so could easily belong to <em>A. darwini</em> or <em>A</em>. &quot;robustus&quot;.<br>

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>- (after Clark et al., 2024) combination of- metatarsal II's laterally-projecting flange of bone closes the intertrochlear incisure, contacting the distomedial margin of metatarsal III's trochlea (more pronounced than the lateroplantarly-projecting flange in <em>A. archibaldi</em>); medial and lateral margins of metatarsal III's trochlea terminate distally at same level (lateral margin more distal in <em>Soroavisaurus</em>, medial margin more distal in <em>A. archibaldi</em>); lateral proximal vascular fenestra proximodistally  shorter than <em>Soroavisaurus</em>.<br>

developed in <em>A. archibaldi</em>; absent in <em>A. darwin</em>i).<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>- Discovered in 2011 (Yamamura, 2013), and first mentioned in Yamamura's thesis as &quot;an avian metatarsal.&quot; This was apparently originally going to be named <em>Avisaurus robustus</em> based on the NEXUS file (mistakenly not published with the paper as of 11-29-2014, but available via Chiappe's peer review pdf at <a href="file:///C|/Users/Mickey/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/IE/JI6WS1ER/download[1].aspx">https://www2.cloud.editorialmanager.com/pone/download.aspx?id=36718157&amp;guid=2bc776d4-2e03-4271-b261-166df50969d3&amp;scheme=1</a> ), but in the final publication Clark et al. state &quot;in light of the fragmentary remains available at present, we refrain from naming this specimen as a new taxon.&quot;&nbsp; Note Clark et al.

<strong>Comments</strong>- Stidham (1998) initially mentioned &quot;at least two species of avisaurids&quot; from Montana or Wyoming in an abstract.&nbsp; Stidham and Hutchison (2001) later specify "tarsometatarsal fragments
representing one or two undescribed taxa" from the Hell Creek Formation
of Montana.  They (1999) state "A juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Avisaurus</span> specimen of an undescribed species from the Maastrichtian Hell Creek
Formation of Montana reveals the presence of distal tarsals in
enantiomithines."  At his 2002
SVP presentation, Stidham used a juvenile avisaurid metatarsal to show
that the distal tarsals fused to the metatarsals before the metatarsals
fuse to each other in enantiornithines (Mortimer, DML 2002).  This
may be UCMP 171634, a
metatarsal III on the UCMP online database identified by Stidham as <em>Avisaurus</em> sp..in 1999.&nbsp; It was discovered on July 26 1978.&nbsp; Stidham and Hitchison's use of &quot;one or two undescribed taxa&quot; based on tarsiometatarsal material suggests another specimen is involved as well.&nbsp; They also note &quot;a large distal tibiotarsus attributable to <em>A. archibaldi</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Longrich et al. (2011) described coracoid YPM 57235 discovered in 2007 as cf. <em>Avisaurus archibaldi</em>, noting &quot;Referral to <em>Avisaurus</em> should be regarded as tentative given that <em>Avisaurus</em> is named on the basis of a tarsometatarsus, but both come from the same formation and represent exceptionally large enantiornithines.&quot;&nbsp; UCMP 17417 is a phalanx identified by Stidham in 2001 as cf. <em>Avisaurus archibaldi</em> (UCMP online).<br>
Stidham and Hutchison's and Longrich et al.'s material was published at a time when <em>archibaldi</em> was the only Hell Creek <em>Avisaurus</em> species named and <em>Avisaurus</em> was the only named large Hell Creek enantiornithine.&nbsp; More recently, the comparably sized <em>A. darwini</em> (88% of archuibaldi's size), unnamed <em>A</em>. sp. MOR 3070 (~79%) and <em>Magnusavis</em> have been described from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, so both the generic and specific identification of all of this material is uncertain.&nbsp; Only Longrich et al.'s coracoid has been described and cannot be compared to any of the named species which are all based on tarsometatarsi.&nbsp; Stidham and Hutchison considered their tarsometatarsal material to represent one or more new species anyway and write (2001) &quot;Phylogenetic analysis of the new avisaurid material<br>
indicates&quot; it &quot;appears to be the sister group to <em>A. archibaldi </em>and <em>A. gloriae</em>&quot; while &quot;<em>Soroavisaurus</em> is the sister taxon to the North American avisaurids.&quot;&nbsp; As <em>gloriae</em> has more recently been removed to the genus <em>Gettyia</em>, their results would actually place the material outside of the modern concept of <em>Avisaurus</em>, although it would still fall out in Avisauridae.<br>

Collected between 1974 and 1976, PVL-4048 was originally illustrated by
Walker (1981). Glut (1982) notes Brett-Surman proposed what is
presumably this and <span style="font-style: italic;">Avisaurus</span>
as a new theropod family
at the 1978 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting. 
Brett-Surman and Paul (1985) made it and PVL-4690 paratypes of <i>Avisaurus
archibaldi</i>, though they referred to PVL-4690 as <i>Avisaurus sp.</i>
and 4048 as Avisauridae in figures (2K-L, 3J-P). They noted the specimens &quot;may prove to be distinct at the species level in the bending of the metatarsal shafts, the presence of a possible fenestra between metatarsals III and IV, the more divergent angle of metatarsal II from metatarsal II, the relatively higher position of the insertion for the m. tibialis anticus [now called the m. tibialis cranialis], and the narrower articular area for the reception of the tibia.&quot;&nbsp; They were also referred to <i>Avisaurus
sp.</i> by Chiappe (1992) and Chiappe and Calvo (1994). Chiappe (1993)
named them both <i>Soroavisaurus australis</i>. <br>
PVL-4033 was also originally illustrated by Walker (and referred to <i>Martinavis</i>
by him in his unpublished manuscript), but not referred to <i>Soroavisaurus</i>
until Chiappe and Walker (2002). The latter authors also referred
PVL-4030 to <i>Soroavisaurus</i> and illustrated both tibiotarsi.
Walker and Dyke (2009) reassigned PVL-4030 to <i>Martinavis sp.</i>
and assigned PVL-4033 to <i>Martinavis</i> in their measurement table.
Walker et al. (2007) stated PVL-4033 is consistant in size with both <i>Enantiornis</i>
and <i>Martinavis</i>. The smaller size of <i>Soroavisaurus</i> does
suggest it may correspond with humeri of <i>Martinavis? vincei</i> or <i>M?
saltariensis</i>, making the assignment of elements like tibiotarsi to
either taxon more semantic than scientific.<br>

<b>Definition</b>- (<i>Bohaiornis guoi</i> + <i>Shenqiornis mengi</i>)
(Wang et al., 2014)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang et al., 2014) robust rostrum; large,
robust, subconical teeth with sharply tapered and slightly distally
recurved tips; pygostyle tapered, without abrupt distal constriction;
scapular blade with convex dorsal magin and straight to weakly concave
ventral margin; omal tips of furcula with blunt expansions visible in
ventrolateral view; sternum with posterolateral process strongly
projecting posterolaterally; pedal digit II more robust than other
digits; pedal unguals extremely elongated with digit III ungual
measuring more than 40% length of tarsometatarsus.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Both Chiappe et al.
(2019) and Hartman et al. (2019) failed to recover this clade (as also

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Wang et al.,
2022) coracoid strongly expanded distolaterally; distal coracoid margin
long and straight; anterior margin of sternum sharply angled at median;
small notch posterior to costal edge of sternum; posteromedial sternal
processes triangular; manual ungual I long and curved; manual ungual II
short and robust.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The interpretation of
preserved pedal phalanges here is slightly different than in Wang et
al.'s (2022) figure 10, in that III-3 and pedal ungual III are viewed
as III-2 and III-3, and IV-4 and pedal ungual IV are viewed as IV-3 and
IV-4 .  This is based on length in typical enantiornithines, as
phalangeal morphology is largely indeterminate due to a lack of
preparation.  <br>
Wang et al. (2022) add the taxon to O'Connor's bird analysis and find
it emerges sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sulcavis</span>

phalanx IV-1 (4.1 mm), phalanx IV-2, phalanx IV-3, pedal phalanx, two
pedal unguals, body feathers, two remiges<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang et al., 2010) narrow nasal lacking
subnarial process; postorbital with elongate, straight ventral process;
robust teeth with circular sections and slightly recurved apices; omal
tips of furcula expanded; distal third of coracoid laterally convex;
posterolateral sternal process expanded distally and fan-shaped;
unreduced and unfused manus with unguals on digits I and II; dorsally
projecting tubercle on posterodorsal surface of semilunate carpal;
pubic boot present; strap-like ischium without obturator process;
J-shaped metatarsal I lacking lateral compression, with lateral facet
for metatarsal II and posterior facet for phalanx I-1.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered before 2009 and used in
O'Connor's (2009) thesis. O'Connor et al. (2011) listed it as
"Dalianornis mengi" in their data matrix, though as <i>Shenquiornis</i>
is used in the main article and cladogram, the matrix was probably
created before it was officially named and mistakenly made it through
publication. Many of the characters listed in the diagnosis are common
in enantiornithines, and the unfused carpometacarpus is probably
ontogenetic.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Hu et al., 2009) sacral centra strongly
compressed transversely; clavicular ramus of furcula straight;
clavicular facet with a transversely expanded proximal end; prominent
ridge along medioventral margin of clavicular ramus of furcula.<br>
(after Hu et al., 2011) posterior end of the articular pointed
posteroventrally.<br>
(after Li et al., 2014) strap-like and faintly ventrally recurved jugal
bar; reduced maxillary and dentary dentition; robust teeth; broad
scleral ossicles; acromion developed as a rectangular process with a
broadly expanded tip; slightly medially hooked acrocoracoid; glenoid
facet on coracoid positioned at approximately the same level as
acrocoracoid process; flat to sub-concave lateral margin of the
coracoid with small lateral process; sternal midline with slightly
developed T-shaped terminus approximately equal in posterior extent to
posterolateral process; elongate, strongly recurved pedal unguals;
third pedal ungual larger but less recurved than other pedal unguals.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hu et al. (2009) state the presence of cervical
centra with strong ventral keels is unique, but this is shared with
most other enantiornithines except <i>Pengornis</i>. The long acromion
is also present in <i>Eoalulavis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Hu et al. (2009) briefly describe this new taxon in
their SVP abstract, which made it a nomen nudum according to ICZN
Article 9.9. They later described it officially in 2011.<br>
Although Hu et al. believed the holotype to be from the Yixian
Formation, Li et al. (2014) described a specimen from near the same
village which was found in the Jiufotang Formation. As their fieldwork
found most of the exposures there to be Jiufotang, so believe the
holotype was from that formation too.<br>
While the authors state <i>Bohaiornis</i> strongly resembles <i>Eoenantiornis</i>
in several characters (short and deep skull with six to seven teeth on
each side of upper and lower jaws; forelimbs subequal to hindlimbs in
length; manual digit I with robust and curved ungual extending distally
to the level of the distal end of metacarpal II), only the short and
deep skull is potentially synapomorphic. Their 2009 phylogenetic
analysis found <i>Bohaiornis</i> to be more derived than <i>Protopteryx</i>,
but more basal than most other enantiornithines including <i>Eoenantiornis</i>.
Their 2011 phylogenetic analysis is a version of the <i>Elsornis</i>
analysis with eight added characters and finds <i>Bohaiornis</i> in a
polytomy with other non-longipterygid enantiornithines. Li et al.
(2014) used a version of Clarke's analysis to find <i>Bohaiornis</i>
more derived than <i>Protopteryx</i>, but outside Longipterygidae and
a clade of <i>Cathayornis</i>, <i>Concornis</i>, <i>Gobipteryx</i>
and <i>Neuquenornis</i>.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (IVPP V11303) (~150 mm) several partial dorsal ribs,

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after O'Connor, 2012) small, imperforate sternum
without posterolateral or posteromedial processes; T-shaped
posteromedian process; anteriorly forked, ventrally projecting sternal
keel that does no extend to anterior margin; sternal keel low distally
and continuous with posteromedian process; femorotibiotarsal ratio 82%;
metatarsal I P-shaped with nearly parallel articular surfaces; large,
curved pedal unguals.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen has a number of controversial element
identifications. An element identified as a scapula by Hou (1997) was
identified as a pubis by Zhou and Hou (2002) and later as two dorsal
ribs by O'Connor (2012). Another pubis identified by Zhou and Hou was
unlabeled in Hou (1997), and identified as more dorsal ribs by
O'Connor. The coracoid is interpreted as laying with its lateral edge
against the sternum by Hou, but with its distal edge against the
sternum in articulation by Zhou and Hou and O'Connor. Finally, an
elongate bone was identified as a hypocleidium by Hou, but as part of
the sternal keel by Zhou and Hou. Clarke (2002) and O'Connor agree with
the former identification.<br>
While initially identified as an euornithine (hiss Ornithurae) by Hou
(1996) and most later non-cladistic studies, Clarke (2002), O'Connor et
al. (2010) and O'Connor (2012) found it to be enantiornithine, the
latter emphasizing the similarity of its sternum to <i>Eoalulavis</i>.<br>

(UA 9752) proximal tibiotarsus (O'Connor and Forster, 2009; described
by O'Connor and Forster, 2010)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Using the tibiotarsus to estimate gives a length of
690 mm, while using the metatarsus gives a length of 460 mm. I decided
to use tibial diameter, figuring this would remain more constant in
different taxa. This gives the 540 mm estimate above, which seems
appropriate. This is based off the referred specimen, the holotype was
about 6% smaller, or about 510 mm long.<br>
Two of the humeri were stated by Forster and O'Connor (2000) to belong
to <i>Vorona</i>, probably FMNH PA 743 and 744 which were stated to
correspond in size to <i>Vorona</i> by O'Connor and Forster (2010).
The three other humeri are ~80% the size, but match in morphology. All
of these are termed Humeral Taxon A by O'Connor and Forster and show a
mix of enantiornithine and euornithine anatomy as <i>Vorona</i> does,
so are tentatively referred to the taxon by those authors. The ulna
speculated to belong to <i>Vorona</i> by Forster and O'Connor (2010)
is probably FMNH PA 750 due to its large size, while O'Connor and
Forster added UA 9751 which is 72% the size. Finally, O'Connor and
Forster (2009) noted a small tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus referrable
to <i>Vorona</i>, which are UA 9752 (based on the reference to
proximal details) and FMNH PA 782 respectively, described by O'Connor
and Forster (2010) as <i>Vorona</i> in addition to distal tibiotarsus
UA 9609. <br>
