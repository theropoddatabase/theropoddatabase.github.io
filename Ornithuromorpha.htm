<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Euornithes was first
used by Stejneger (1884; not Cope, 1889, contra Sereno, online 2005 and
Turner et al., 2012) as a superorder containing living birds besides
palaeognaths (his Dromaeognathae) and penguins (his Impennes). Sanz and
Buscalioni (1992) later erected the homonym
Euornithes as a new subclass, "the most recent common ancestor of <i>Iberomesornis</i>
and Ornithurae (sensu Gauthier 1986 and Cracraft 1986) and all of its
descendants", which is equivalent to a modern Ornithothoraces. These
were both largely ignored.  In the 1990s, birds intermediate
between enantiornithines and ornithurines began to be recognized, with
Chinese and BAND authors generally expanding the concept of Ornithurae
to include those taxa they studied (<span style="font-style: italic;">Chaoyangia</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoningornis</span> incorrectly, <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span>) while Western
cladists created Ornithuromorpha for the taxa they studied (<span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Vorona</span> possibly incorrectly, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>).  Unfortunately,
Ornithuromorpha was given node-based definitions dependant on <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span> (and sometimes <span style="font-style: italic;">Vorona</span>),
which had an uncertain placement relative to the numerous Chinese taxa
described in the early 2000s (yanornithids, hongshanornithids,
schizoourids, etc.).  Thus Ornithuromorpha became an unstable
clade content-wise instead of the clade of birds closer to Aves than
Enantiornithes that most people wanted to refer to.  One solution
was to use the expanded Ornithurae of Chinese authors, but formally
define it, which unfortunately led to an apomorphy-based definition
dependant on pygostyle anatomy (Gauthier and de Queiroz, 2001). 
This was problematic because several relevant taxa (<span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Vorona</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaoyangia</span>, the types of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeorhynchus</span>)
don't preserve pygostyles, a classic example of why apomorphy-based
definitions should be avoided.  Another solution proposed by
O'Connor et al. (2016) was to redefine Ornithuromorpha to be "The first
ancestor of Neornithes that is not also an ancestor of the
Enantiornithes, and all of its descendants."  These definitions
were not used widely outside of Clarke's and O'Connor's works
respectively.  Sereno (1998) had instead proposed Euornithes as a
new taxon with the definition "All ornithothoracines closer to
Neornithes than to <em>Sinornis</em>", followed by Longrich's (2009)
definition "all birds closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Passer</span>
than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Enantiornis</span>" and
Turner et al.'s (2012) "<span style="font-style: italic;">Passer
domesticus</span> (Linnaeus, 1758) and all coelurosaurs closer to it
than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Cathayornis yandica</span>
Zhou et al., 1992."  These are all equivalent in modern topologies
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Cathayornis</span>
have been universally recognized as enantiornithines since 2000. 
The resolution of what to call the clade was made by Benito et al.'s
(2022) use of Phylocode to establish the definition as "The largest
clade containing <span style="font-style: italic;">Vultur gryphus</span>
Linnaeus, 1758 (Aves or Neornithes) but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Enantiornis leali</span> Walker, 1981
(Enantiornithes) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Cathayornis
yandica</span>
Zhou, Jin &amp; Zhang, 1992 (Enantiornithes)", which is followed
here.  As Benito et al. state, Phylocode Note 9.15A.2 says "In
order for two uses of identically spelled preexisting names to be
considered the same name rather than homonyms, one use must have been
derived from the other or both derived from a third use of the name. If
later uses of a name are not accompanied by a reference to an earlier
use, absence of any overlap in the compositions associated with
identically spelled names can be taken as evidence that they are
homonyms", and Sereno (1998) lists Euornithes as "new taxon" and states
it is "a taxon coined here" while also claiming to be "Unaware of Sanz
and Buscalioni (1992)" in 1998 (Sereno, online 2005) and was evidently
unaware of Stejneger's work even in 2005 as he cites Cope, 1889
instead.  Thus Euornithes Stegnejer, 1884 and Euornithes Sanz and
Buscalioni, 1988 are homonyms of Euornithes Sereno, 1998 and the latter
should be cited as the proper author.<br>

aquatic bird. Nesov identified it as coming from the Beshtyuba

Tcelpyk) belongs to the Khodzhakul Formation instead. If it is indeed a
fused distal tarsometatarsus, it is probably an euornithine. Nessov
notes metatarsal II ends more proximally than III and IV.<br>

<b>Materal</b>- (TsNIGRI 44/11915; paratype of <i>Zhyraornis kashkarovi</i>)
proximal scapula<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This scapula was originally a paratype of <i>Zhyraornis
kashkarovi</i> (Nesov, 1984). Kurochkin (1996) later noted the acromion
and glenoid showed "a certain similarity" to enantiornithines, but
could not refer to to <i>Zhyraornis</i> itself (which he regarded as
an enantiornithine). The elongate anteriorly projecting acromion and
limited coracoid articulation indicates it is ornithothoracine, while
Nesov noted the coracoid articular surface was weakly convex, unlike
enantiornitines. <i>Patagopteryx</i> differs in having a transversely
expanded acromion which is also ventrally constricted, distally flat
and dorsally angled. That of <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> is smaller and
more separated from the scapula ventrally. That of <i>Yixianornis</i>
is slightly more slender and dorsally projected, and is separated
ventrally from the bulbous coracoid tubercle. <i>Ambiortus</i>'
acromion is different in being dorsoventrally compressed and having a
dorsal tubercle, though the length and low coracoid tubercle are
roughly similar. <i>Apsaravis</i> has a more elongate and hooked
acromion, though the coracoid tubercle is similarly low. The scapulae
of hesperornithines are highly reduced, while <i>Ichthyornis</i> has
an apomorphically reduced acromion. <i>Iaceornis</i>' is narrower and
hooked, with a bulbous coracoid tubercle. Those of Aves sensu stricto
are generally dorsoventrally compressed. TsNIGRI 44/11915 is here
referred to Euornithes incertae sedis, though it may belong to <i>Zhyraornis</i>.

<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1992a) noted a coracoid with a "deep, round

possibly an ichthyornithiform (Nessov, 1992b). Note the specimen number
is the same as a distal coracoid now referred to <i>Abavornis</i>
species and labeled Aves in the same figure. Compared to <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
it has a more proximolateral-distomedially oriented scapular cotyla,
and a more laterally and less ventrally angled acrocoracoid which is
dorsoventrally flatter. The concave scapular cotyla does indicate
referral to Euornithes however.<br>

discovered in 1989, which seems to be a dorsal vertebra (ZIN PO 4607)
later figured by him as <i>Ichthyornis sp.</i> (Nessov, 1992b). It is
roughly similar to <i>Ichthyornis</i>, but the dorsals of that taxon
are not diagnostic, and ZIN PO 4607 could come from another related
taxon as well. It is from an avebrevicaudan due to its large lateral
central fossae, probably an ornithothoracine based on its age. It is
not an enantiornithine, as the parapophyses are anteriorly placed, and
can be excluded from Hesperornithes and Aves sensu stricto due to its
amphicoely.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- IVPP V26194 was
initially mentioned by Harris et al. (2009) as likely belonging to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>,
noted as the posterior cranial half exposed in dorsal view. 
O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022) described it as an indeterminate
euornithine (ornithuromorph in their usage), as it was not easily
comparable to probable <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>
skull IVPP V26199 which is preserved in ventral view and only the first
three cervicals.  O'Connor et al. used O'Connor's bird analysis to
recover it as an avialan in a trichotomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Jeholornis</span>
and Pygostylia, which they attributed "to the limited number of
morphological characters that could be confidently scored into the
current matrix."  Adding it to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph
analysis places it in Enantiornithes, but only a single step moves it
to Euornithes.  Among Xiagou taxa, it takes 0 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimaia</span>, 1 step to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Dunhuangia</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Feitianius</span>, 3 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Qiliania</span>, 4 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Meemannavis</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Yumenornis</span>, 5 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Changmaornis</span>, and 8 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiuquanornis</span>.  Cervical
proportions indicate it is not <span style="font-style: italic;">Brevidentavis</span>.<br>
IVPP V26195 was also first mentioned by Harris et al. (2009) as a
likely <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>
specimen, as the one which "preserves a caudal fragment of the
braincase that exhibits an intricate series of curvilinear impressions
that may correspond to portions of the brain or neural
vasculature."  O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022) also described
this as an indeterminate euornithine (ornithuromorph) as only the first
three
cervicals are comparable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>,
and used O'Connor's bird analysis to recover it in a polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Xinghaiornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zhongjianornis</span>
(note the trees in their figure 9 are majority rule and implied
weighting).  In Hartman et al.'s matrix it resolves as an avian,
and takes 1 more step to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Changmaornis</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Meemannavis</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Yumenornis</span>, 3 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimaia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dunhuangia</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Feitianius</span>, 4 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiuquanornis</span>, and 5 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Qiliania</span>.  As for the above
specimen, cervical proportions indicate it is not <span style="font-style: italic;">Brevidentavis</span>.<br>
IVPP V26196 is the last specimen noted by Harris et al. (2009) as
probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>,
one of the "caudal halves of crania" preserved in right lateral
view.  Again, O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022) describe this as
an indeterminate euornithine (ornithuromorph), which is again difficult
to compare to
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span> specimen preserved
in ventral view.  They recovered this specimen in a polytomy with
other euornithines (again, the more precise positions in their figure 9
are due to majority rule consensus and implied weighting).  In
Hartman et al.'s matrix it resolves as an enantiornithine, taking no
steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimaia</span>, 1 step
to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Dunhuangia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Feitianius</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Meemannavis</span>, 2 steps to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Qiliania</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Yumenavis</span>, 3 to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Changmaornis</span>, 4 to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Brevidentavis</span> and 6 to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiuquanornis</span>.<br>

This was discovered in 1992 and "may be an early ornithurine" according
to Buffetaut et al. (2005).  That was based on two
characters, the transversely oriented dorsal condyle and the brachial
fossa, which are both present in many theropods.  It is

This was mentioned as "a small, heterocoelous cervical vertebra, which
has been tentatively identified as an ornithuromorph."  It is here
placed in Euornithes as Ornithuromorpha was often used as a rough
synonym at the time, and taxa basal to <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span> (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jianchangornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeorhynchus</span>) also have

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Schizoouridae was
named by Zelenkov in a Russian book chapter by Zelenkov and Kurochkin
(2015) as a sister taxon to Apsaravidae in Euornithes (his
Ornithurae).  This was not based on a numerical phylogenetic
analysis and a pairing of <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Apsaravis</span> has not been
recovered to my knowledge in such analyses.  However, as <span style="font-style: italic;">Apsaravis</span> is near universally found
to be closer to Aves than <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span>
their phylogenetic definition serves as a name for whichever taxa group
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span> to the
exclusion of Aves.<br>
Wang et al. (2019 online) were unaware of Zelenkov's work so tried to
create the name Schizoouridae themselves.  They intended it to
include <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Mengciusornis</span>, but the latter falls
out closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Bellulornis</span>
using the Hartman et al. maniraptoromorph matrix, so that their
phylogenetic definition self destructs.  At least six steps are
necessary to make the definition valid.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- O'Connor and Zhou (2013; first online in 2012) used
the name "Eoornithura lii" in their supplementary information, which
based on its absence in the main paper where <i>Schizooura</i> <i>lii</i>is
present, and similarity to that name, is near certainly an early
name for the taxon.  Zhou et al. (2012) list the pygostyle length
as 20 mm, but this includes all eight associated distal vertebrae,
while Wang et al. (2017) lists it as 6.45 mm, presumably only including
the fused distal three elements.  Wang et al. (2020) determined
"CT scanning clearly shows that the upper and lower jaws of <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span> are toothless" and
provided revised measurements.<br>

<b>Diagnosis-</b> (after Zhou and Zhang, 2006) premaxilla toothless
(also in <i>Ichthyornis</i>+<i>Passer</i>); maxilla toothless (also in
Aves); dentary toothless (also in <i>Longicrusavis</i> and Carinatae);
premaxillae broad with slightly rounded tips; dentary spatulate; strong
longitudinal medial ridge on dentary dorsal to Meckelian groove;
pointed omal tips of furcula (also in <i>Yixianornis</i>); forelimb
elongate (humerus+ulna / femur+tibiotarsus ratio of 138%) (also large
in <i>Ichthyornis</i>- ~176%); tibiotarsofemoral ratio 1.14.<br>
(after Wang and Zhou, 2017) glenoid facet of coracoid strongly projects
laterally; lateral margin of coracoid longer than medial margin;
posterior surface of furcula excavated by deep furrow.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou and Zhang (2006) also included the
elongate foramina and grooves on the lateral dentary as a diagnostic
character, but this is correlated with the lack of teeth. The broad
sternum with deep posterior notches and elongate posterolateral
processes are symplesiomorphies shared with enantiornithines. The
character "hindlimb shortened" is already covered in forelimb/hindlimb
ratio and tibiotarsal length. Metatarsals II and IV of <i>Patagopteryx</i>,
songlingornithids and <i>Apsaravis</i> are also nearly equal in length.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This taxon first appeared as a nomen nudum OTU in Zhou
and Zhang's (2005) online matrix, though it did not appear in their
cladogram. If the matrix is run in PAUP, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> forms
an unresolved polytomy with <i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Liaoningornis</i>
and more derived euornithines (<i>Apsaravis</i>, songlingornithids and
Ornithurae). This is the same as the published tree in Zhou and Zhang
(2006). In both papers, <i>Patagopteryx</i> was coded but excluded for
no stated reason, yet emerges as the most basal euornithine when the
matrix is run with it.<br>

2005, this was first mentioned by Harris et al. (2009) as likely
referrable to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>,
it being one of three specimens which "consist primarily of the caudal
halves of crania", in left lateral view that "also preserves portions
of dentaries that, although toothless, may possess very small
alveoli."  O'Connor et al. (2021) presented it at a later SVP
presentation as a new taxon "Meemannavis ductrix", mentioned in the
abstract as that specimen with the edentulous dentary.  It was
named and described by O'Connor et al. (2021 online), but the paper
had
no mention of ZooBank and
"Meemannavis" lacked an entry on the ZooBank
website.  Thus according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work
must "be registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Meemannavis ductrix" O'Connor
et al.,
2021 was a nomen nudum that became valid in September 2022 once the
volume was published.  O'Connor et al. (2022) suggest
that one of the possible palatines may be a prearticular, and that part
of the possible pterygid may be a quadrate.<br>
O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022) added it to O'Connor's bird matrix
and recovered it in a large polytomy of euornithines, excluded from
Neognathae, Schizhoouridae and several pairs of OTUs.  Note the
trees in their figure are majority rule and implied weighting. 
Adding it to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis results in a

Chaoyangithiformes (credited to Hou, 1997) and Chaoyangornithidae (this
time containing both <i>Chaoyangia</i> and <i>Songlingornis</i>).
Both of these are malformed, as there is no "Chaoyangithes" or

Holotype</b>- (IVPP V9934) (~235 mm) eleven dorsal vertebrae, eight
dorsal ribs, dorsal rib fragments, three uncinate processes,
gastralia(?), synsacrum, about five caudal vertebrae, ilia (one
partial; 32 mm), pubes (51 mm), ischia (30 mm), femora (one incomplete;
45 mm), tibiotarsus, proximal fibula, tarsometatarsal fragment<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after O'Connor and Zhou, 2013) uncinate
processes expanded basally, forming a 55 degree angle with the rib;
ischium with two, gradually expanding, dorsal processes; ischia
distally contacting;  femoral neck poorly defined.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of the characters listed in the diagnosis by
Hou and Zhang (1993), most are symplesiomorphies (non-heterocoelous
dorsal vertebrae; uncinate processes; sacrum not fused to ilia; 
unfused pelvis; pelvis opisthopubic; preacetabular process longer than
postacetabular process; pubic symphysis; femoral head well developed;
fourth trochanter absent). The longitudinally grooved dorsal ribs are
also present in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>,
so are more widely distributed. More than eight sacral vertebrae are
present in most euornithines. The ilium is described as "nephroid" and
the femoral shaft "well developed", which are too vague to elaborate.
The postacetabular process was described as expanded, but Hou and Zhang
included portions of the sacrum in the postacetabular process (O'Connor
and Zhou, 2013). The postacetabular process is actually tapered as in
most maniraptorans. The pubis is reported to be pneumatized, which is
otherwise only reported in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> among Mesozoic
theropods, but difficult to determine in most specimens and of
uncertain validity in <i>Chaoyangia</i> (perhaps the pubic shaft is
hollow but non-pneumatic). The cnemial crest is equally well developed
in <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Yanornis</i>. <br>
Hou (1997) adds a few supposedly diagnostic characters. The thin-walled
long bones (femur and presumably tibia) and fibula unfused to the tibia
are symplesiomorphic for theropods. The femur is said to be pneumatized
via a foramen on the proximolateral side, but this is only reported for
<i>Shixinggia</i> among Mesozoic theropods. Hou's record of erroneous
morphological interpretation makes me wary of accepting this character
as valid.<br>
Zhou and Hou (2002) add the character "uncinate processes long, slender
and ventrally distributed to their diagnosis, but they are longer and
more slender in <i>Confuciusornis</i> and similarly placed as well.
They also state the postacetabular process is slightly rounded, but the
posterior curvature is similar to <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, though
taller. A pubic symphysis of about a third of pubic length (30%) falls
within the range of variation in <i>Confuciusornis</i>, and is not
that different from <i>Hongshanornis</i> (26%) or <i>Yanornis</i>
(35%). The trochanteric crest is equally high in taxa like <i>Confuciusornis</i>
and <i>Vorona</i>. The rest of their new diagnostic characters are
based on <i>Songlingornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1990 and was merely
referred to Aves order indet. by Hou and Zhang (1993). Other specimens
were subsequently referred by Hou et al. (1996), but "a partial foot"
was later found to be from an indeterminate euornithine (IVPP V9937),
while "a shoulder girdle including the furcula, coracoids, and sternum"
was made the holotype of a new genus (IVPP V10913- <i>Songlingornis</i>).
Hou (1997) states there are three cervicals and seven dorsals
preserved, but such a low number of dorsals would be unheard of in a
non-avian theropod, and it is more likely all ten presacral vertebrae
are dorsals as agreed by O'Connor and Zhou (2013). <br>
<b><i>Chaoyangia</i> a basal euornithine?</b> Hou et al. (1996)
referred <i>Chaoyangia</i> to basal Euornithes (their Ornithurae) due
to the uncinate processes (now known to be present in many
maniraptorans) and several characters preserved only in IVPP V10913. <br>
Hou (1997) followed Hou et al.'s phylogenetic scheme, with additional
evidence for <i>Chaoyangia</i> being a euornithine being ossified,
pneumatized and elongated gastralia and a well developed cnemial crest.
The gastralial characters are confusing, since no other euornithines
known at the time preserved gastralia besides perhaps a couple elements
in the probably incorrectly referred <i>Liaoningornis</i>. In any
case, gastralia are symplesiomorphic for theropods, and are more
elongate in basal taxa like <i>Changchengornis</i> (39% of femoral
length) than in euornithines like <i>Yixianornis</i> (18%). <i>Chaoyangia</i>'s
are intermediate (28%). The only theropod with verified pneumatic
gastralia is <i>Aerosteon</i>, and I am doubtful it can be verified in
<i>Chaoyangia</i>, especially given Hou's history of misinterpretation
and his additional claims of pneumaticity in the taxon (femur, pubis,
etc.). The cnemial crest is as anteriorly elevated and pointed in some
enantiornithines like <i>Eoenantiornis</i> and has yet to be analyzed
on a broad scale in bird phylogeny. <br>
Zhou (1999) found <i>Chaoyangia</i> to be a basal euornithine (his
Ornithurae) in his thesis. Additional characters not based on <i>Songlingornis</i>
include- proximodorsal ischial process absent; ischium expanded
distally due to low mid dorsal process (not present in <i>Apsaravis</i>,
but seems valid); tall trochanteric crest (miscoded as absent in <i>Confuciusornis</i>
and enantiornithines).<br>
Zhang and Zhou (2000) included <i>Chaoyangia</i> in a version of
Chiappe's bird matrix, finding it to be a basal euornithine. In
addition to the uncinate processes and characters based on <i>Songlingornis</i>,
this was also due to the supposedly subparallel pelvic elements
(miscoded as present in <i>Chaoyangia</i>), compressed pubic shaft
(miscoded as present in <i>Chaoyangia</i>- Clarke, 2002), trochanteric
crest (miscoded as absent in <i>Confuciusornis</i>, <i>Protopteryx</i>
and <i>Sinornis</i>), and medial cnemial crest (somewhat questionable,
as it may be taphonomic- O'Connor and Zhou, 2013).<br>
Thus despite several miscodings and problematic characters, two
characters support placing <i>Chaoyangia</i> in Euornithes-
proximodorsal ischial process absent; ischium expanded distally due to
low mid dorsal process.  Using Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph
dataset, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaoyangia</span> falls out
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span><br>
<b><i>Chaoyangia</i> a basal pygostylian?</b> Clarke (2002) is one of
the few Western authors to comment on <i>Chaoyangia</i>. She found it
to fall out as a pygostylian outside Ornithuromorpha. This was based on
four characters, of which two were misinterpreted in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaoyangia</span>.
Clarke suggested it had seven sacrals, but O'Connor and Zhou (2013)
more recently show it has at least nine, and possibly up to eleven,
sacrals.  Clarke also claimed its pelvic elements were
incompletely fused, but all three elements were fused together in the
holotype.  Additionally newly discovered taxa have shown most
basal euornithines are equally primitive in the remaining characters-
all euornithines except <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Apsaravis</span> plus
ornithurines have pubic symphyses; and <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>, hongshanornithids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Iteravis</span> and <i>Gansus</i> have
pubic boots. Clarke further claimed that <i>Chaoyangia</i> was
identical to <i>Confuciusornis</i> in all scored characters, and may
be synonymous, but <i>Confuciusornis</i> differs in lacking a pubic
boot, having a narrower postacetabular process, and a shorter ischium
with a proximodorsal process and no mid dorsal process. Forcing <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaoyangia</span>
to be outside Ornithothoraces in the Hartman et al. maniraptoromorph
dataset results in trees 7 steps longer where it falls out by <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span>.<br>
<i><b>Songlingornis</b></i>- Hou et al. (1996) referred at least one
additional specimen to <i>Chaoyangia</i> (IVPP V10913), which was
later made the holotype of the new genus <i>Songlingornis</i> (Hou,
1997). The reference of IVPP V10913 to <i>Chaoyangia</i> was followed
by Hou and Zhou (1999) and Zhou and Hou (2002), though the latter did
indicate it had also been used as the holotype of <i>Songlingornis</i>.
The specimens preserve few elements in common (though not none, as
claimed by Clarke and Norell, 2001)- several dorsal vertebrae, dorsal
ribs and proximal femur. The dorsals are alike in being
non-heterocoelous, but this is similar to all non-hesperornithine,
non-avian birds. Both femora are described as having proximally
projecting trochanteric crests, shallow trochanteric fossae and large
heads. These features are comparable to many basal birds including <i>Confuciusornis</i>
and <i>Vorona</i>. The only point of difference in their descriptions
in that <i>Chaoyangia</i> is said to have a "basically absent" neck,
while <i>Songlingornis</i> has a "relatively well developed neck." Yet
<i>Chaoyangia</i>'s proximal femur has a near identical shape to <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span>'.
Thus the taxa cannot be distinguished, but also share no synapomorphies
that would allow them to be synonymized.  Forcing them to be
sister taxa in the Hartman et al. dataset results in trees only one
step longer, where <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span>
moves to Patagopterygiformes<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Alvarenga and Bonaparte, 1992) cervical
vertebrae completely heterocoelous (also in Ornithurae); dorsal
vertebrae 6-11 procoelous; reduced forelimbs; large lateral process on
distal postacetabular process; medial process on distal postacetabular
process.<br>
(after Chiappe, 1996a) quadrate fused to pterygoid; quadrate foramen
present laterally; fifth dorsal vertebra biconvex; posterior dorsal
vertebrae with very wide reniform centra; posterior articular surface
of synsacrum convex; acromion transversely expanded anteriorly;
proximal end of coracoid with dorsally projecting section for scapular
articulation; two prominent intermuscular lines on dorsal shaft of
humerus; distal ulna extremely anteroposteriorly compressed; metacarpal
III more robust than metacarpal II; strong medial laminar process on
metacarpal II (a reduced metacarpal I?); pubis anteroposteriorly
compressed; distal pubis anteriorly curved; prominent m. iliofibularis
tubercle on fibula; distal fibula fused to anterior side of
tibiotarsus; minimum width of tarsometatarsus over 20% of length;
untwisted metatarsal I.<br>
(after Chiappe, 2002a) acromion dorsoventrally expanded at tip (also in
<i>Apsaravis</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Some of Alvarenga and Bonaparte's (1992)
diagnostic characters are symplesiomorphic- notarium absent; anterior
articular surface of synsacrum strongly concave; synsacrum
dorsoventrally compressed; synsacrum transversely wide; humerus lacks
pneumotricipital foramen; ilium weakly fused to synsacrum;
preacetabular process vertically oriented; preacetabular process
laterally far from synsacrum; iliac crest single and extends to
posterior margin of ilium; opisthopubic pelvis; ilioischial fenestra
open; iliopubic fenestra open; lateral cnemial crest anteriorly
developed; supratendinal bridge absent on tibiotarsus.<br>
Of Chiappe's (2002a) diagnostic characters, the prominent iliac crest
is plesiomorphic for avepods and the "well developed caudolateral
spine" seems to be the supratrochanteric process common in basal birds.
The ischium is also paddle-shaped in <i>Yixianornis</i>, <i>Gansus</i>,
<i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Iaceornis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype and MACN-N-10 were discovered in 1984,
while MACN-N-11 was discovered in 1985. They were first commented on by
Bonaparte (1986), who described them as ratite-like. Chiappe (1991)
noted the description of the then unnamed taxon was in press, also
mentioning MUCPv-48 as "housed in the UNC". The taxon was formally
described by Alvarenga and Bonaparte (1992), and redescribed by
Chiappe, first in his unpublished thesis (1992), then in 1996a, and
finally in depth in 2002a. Chinsamy et al. (1994, 1995) described its
histology.<br>
Alvarenga and Bonaparte (1992) stated there are indications that the
then unprepared MACN-N-11 lacked a pygostyle, but this cannot be
confirmed. The supposed furcular epicleidia in the holotype were later
determined to be proximal coracoids (Chiappe, 1996). The supposed
distal coracoid preserved in the holotype is probably not a <i>Patagopteryx</i>
element (Chiappe, 1996). Hutchinson (2001) identified a proximodorsal
ischial process and an obturator flange.<br>
<b> <i>Patagopteryx</i> a palaeognath?</b> Alvarenga and Bonaparte
(1992) and Alvarenga (1993) proposed a close relationship to
palaeognaths, rheiforms in particular, but also lithornithiforms,
tinamiforms, casuariiforms and apterygiforms. Characters supporting
this are largely symplesiomorphic for birds- elongate acromion on
scapula; pneumotricipital foramen absent (a reversal in ratites); open
ischiopubic fenestra; open ilioischiadic fenestra; deep and triangular
popliteal fossa; robust and anteriorly developed lateral cnemial crest;
supratendinal bridge absent (probably a reversal in some lithornithids
and ratites); round lateral tibiotarsal condyle; reduced hypotarsus (a
reversal in ratites). "General form and proportions" of cervical
vertebrae being similar to tinamiforms is too vague to evaulate. The
supposedly horizontal postacetabular process would be primitive for
carinates, but seems to be untrue in <i>Patagopteryx</i> in any case. <i>Patagopteryx</i>'s
trochanteric crest is not wide and planar laterally, as it has a
lateral ridge and ITCR insertion scar. The trochanteric crest does not
appear more anteriorly expanded than enantiornithines or <i>Vorona</i>.
The supposedly medially placed tendinal groove is instead a depression
formed by the extensor retinaculum ridges as in <i>Apsaravis</i>
(Clarke and Norell, 2002), so is not homologous to the condition in
palaeognaths. The tibiotarsal intercondylar groove is not particularly
shallow or wide, contra Alvarenga and Bonaparte. Chiappe (1995) noted
there is no "tendency for the ischia to become horizontal and approach
each other medially", though the latter would be primitive for birds.
Chiappe also notes <i>Patagopteryx</i> has a single cnemial crest, not
two in which the "inner is formed over the outer" as is apparently the
case in some ratites. The dorsoventrally flattened posterior dorsal
centra and anteroposteriorly compressed ulna are apparently similar to
rheiforms and are otherwise unknown in basal euornithines. <br>
Kurochkin (1995) placed <i>Patagopteryx</i> within Ratitae based on
several characters. The heterocoelous cervical vertebrae are
symplesiomorphic for avians, and are found in some basal euornithines
like <i>Apsaravis</i> and hesperornithines as well. The dorsals are
said to be "transitional to heterocoely or procoelous", but <i>Patagopteryx</i>
also has opisthocoelous and biconvex dorsals. Heterocoelous dorsals are
similar to Aves and Hesperornithes, but no palaeognaths seem to have
procoelous dorsals. Contra Kurochkin, the tibiotarsus lacks an anterior
cnemial crest, which would be symplesiomorphic for a more inclusive
clade than Ratitae in any case. The completely fused tarsometatarsus is
symplesiomorphic for euornithines. A hallux with two phalanges is
symplesiomorphic for all reptiles. <br>
There are a few additional Aves characters which <i>Patagopteryx</i>
does possess- a tricondylar quadrate articulation; the deltopectoral
crest is oriented anteriorly (also in <i>Alamitornis</i>); the
deltopectoral crest is lower than shaft width (also in <i>Alamitornis</i>
and hesperornithines); pubic symphysis absent (also in <i>Apsaravis</i>,
hesperornithines and Carinatae). While there are several characters
shared with Aves and a couple apparently shared with Rheiformes, these
are outweighed by the large number of characters suggesting a more
basal position, as described below.<br>
<b><i>Patagopteryx</i> a hesperornithine?</b> Chatterjee (1999)
performed a phylogenetic analysis which found <i>Patagopteryx</i> to
be the sister taxon of Hesperornithiformes. This was only based on the
ulna being shorter than the humerus (miscoded in <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and now also known to be true in <i>Hongshanornis</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>)
and the supposedly absent distal trochlear surface on the ulna
(actually unknown in <i>Patagopteryx</i>). In addition, <i>Patagopteryx</i>
has to reverse the spherical head found in ornithurines in Chatterjee's
cladogram. Thus there is basically no support for placing <i>Patagopteryx</i>
in Hesperornithes.<br>
<b><i>Patagopteryx</i> an enantiornithine?</b> Feduccia (1999) listed <i>Patagopteryx</i>
under Enantiornithes, though he did not mention reasons besides noting
both <i>Patagopteryx</i> and Lecho Formation enantiornithines have
LAGS in their femoral histology. However, these are also present in <i>Rahonavis</i>,
so are probably plesiomorphic. While <i>Patagopteryx</i> does share a
few characters with enantiornithines (e.g. some of the latter have
tarsometatarsi which are excavated posteriorly), it has many more
euornithine characters.<br>
<b><i>Patagopteryx</i> a basal euornithine?</b> Chiappe (1991) first
suggested the then unnamed <i>Patagopteryx</i> was unrelated to any
ornithurine. His 1992 thesis proposed it was basal to Ornithurae,
though this was not published until Chiappe and Calvo (1994)
(elaborated on in Chiappe, 1995). That phylogenetic analysis supported
excluding <i>Patagopteryx</i> from Ornithurae as the basalmost
euornithine based on- pterygoid process of quadrate rounded; more than
ten dorsal vertebrae (now also known to be more primitive than
songlingornithids, <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>); uncinate
processes absent (probably untrue, as only a few ribs are preserved and
uncinates are primitive for maniraptorans); procoracoid process absent
(now also known to be more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Hongshanornis</i>,
<i>Ambiortus</i>, songlingornithids and <i>Gansus</i>); humeral head
anteriorly concave (now also known to also be more primitive than <i>Hongshanornis</i>,
<i>Ambiortus</i>, songlingornithids, <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>);
acetabulum &gt;11% of ilial length (now also known to be more primitive
than songlingornithids and <i>Gansus</i>); pubis and ischium not
parallel to ilium (now also known to be more primitive than <i>Apsaravis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i>); pubis not laterally compressed (now known also to
be more primitive than <i>Apsaravis</i>); femur lacks patellar groove
(now also known to be more primitive than <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>);
anterior cnemial crest absent (now also known to be more primitive than
<i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Gansus</i>); m. iliofibularis tubercle
of fibula not posteriorly oriented (now also known to be more primitive
than <i>Gansus</i>); metatarsal III not plantarily displaced
proximally (now also known to be more primitive than songlingornithids,
<i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>); intercotylar eminence of
tarsometatarsus poorly developed. In 1996a, Chiappe performed another
analysis which added an additional character to support this- articular
not pneumatic (now also known to be more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>).
In 2001 (repeated in 2002b), Chiappe expanded the analysis once more,
finding <i>Patagopteryx</i> and <i>Vorona</i> to be basal to
ornithurines. Added characters which supported excluding <i>Patagopteryx</i>
from the latter clade are- anterior articular surface of synsacrum
strongly concave (somewhat ambiguous, as it is somewhat concave in most
coelurosaurs); extensor canal absent on tibiotarsus (now also known to
be more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, songlingornithids and <i>Apsaravis</i>);
wide medial condyle on tibiotarsus (now also known to be more primitive
than <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>); transverse groove
proximally undercuts tibiotarsal condyles (now also known to be more
primitive than <i>Gansus</i> and probably <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>).<br>
Norell and Clarke (2001) first published Clarke's matrix, which found <i>Patagopteryx</i>
was not only basal to ornithurines, but also their new taxon <i>Apsaravis</i>.
Additional basal euornithines have subsequently been added to the
matrix (<i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Ambiortus</i>,
songlingornithids, <i>Gansus</i>), which have all ended up more
derived than <i>Patagopteryx</i> as well. New characters which support
placing <i>Patagopteryx</i> outside Ornithurae are- less than ten
sacral vertebrae (also more primitive than <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>);
humerus not domed proximally (also more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>,
<i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Ambiortus</i>, songlingornithids, <i>Apsaravis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i>); radius without muscle impression along
ventroposterior surface (also more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>
and <i>Apsaravis</i>); metacarpal III &gt;50% of width of metacarpal
II (also more primitive than <i>Yanornis</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>);
manual phalanx II-1 not strongly compressed dorsoventrally (also more
primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Ambiortus</i>,
songlingornithids, <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>);
antitrochanter directly posterior to acetabulum (probably a reversal,
as more basal avialans have the opposite state); only one proximal
vascular foramen on tarsometatarsus; fossa for metatarsal I on
tarsometatarsus absent. In addition, <i>Patagopteryx</i> can be
excluded from Carinatae due to- dorsal vertebrae lack ossified tendons
on transverse processes; sacral vertebrae lack a series with short
dorsally oriented transverse processes (also more primitive than <i>Gansus</i>).
Finally, it can be excluded from Aves based on- quadrate foramen not
located posteromedially; less than fifteen sacral vertebrae; no
pneumatic foramen in humerus; the ilium does not overlap any dorsal
ribs (also more primitive than <i>Gansus</i>); distal vascular foramen
with one exit.<br>
Cau and Arduini (2008) found <i>Patagopteryx</i> in a similar
position, basal to all euornithines except <i>Vorona</i>. New
characters influencing this position are- large hypapophyses absent in
mid dorsals (also more primitive than <i>Gansus</i>); mid sacral
centra not transversely compressed (also more primitive than <i>Gansus</i>);
coracoid lateral process absent (this is miscoded in <i>Patagopteryx</i>);
sternal keel absent (probably a reversal due to flightlessness, as <i>Confuciusornis</i>
sometimes has a keel); manual phalanx II-2 longer than II-1 (also more
primitive than <i>Ambiortus</i>, songlingornithids and <i>Gansus</i>);
proximodorsal process on ischium (also more primitive than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>,
<i>Chaoyangia</i>, songlingornithids, <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>);
fibula longer than half tibiotarsal length (also more primitive than <i>Hongshanornis</i>,
songlingornithids and <i>Gansus</i>). Additionally, it is excluded
from Carinatae based on- acrocoracoid process not hooked medially;
coracoid foramen absent (miscoded in Aves, as it is absent in most, so
not valid for excluding <i>Patagopteryx</i>); metatarsal II ginglymoid
(miscoded in <i>Ichthyornis</i> and polymorphic in Aves, so not very
useful for excluding <i>Patagopteryx</i>).<br>
Gao et al. (2008) also found <i>Patagopteryx</i> to be a euornithine
basal to Aves and <i>Gansus</i>. O'Connor et al. (2009) later used the
same matrix with other euornithines added (<i>Hongshanornis</i>, PKUP
V1069, <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Yanornis</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i>)
and found <i>Patagopteryx</i> to be basal to all of them. New
characters supporting this include- well developed olecranon fossa
absent in humerus (also absent in <i>Apsaravis</i>, Hesperornithes and
<i>Ichthyornis</i>; so probably convergent in <i>Yixianornis</i> and
Aves, but does exclude <i>Patagopteryx</i> from the latter); m.
scapulotriceps groove absent in humerus (also absent in <i>Apsaravis</i>,
some <i>Ichthyornis</i> and palaeognaths; so probably convergent in <i>Yixianornis</i>
and Neognathae); ischium &gt;66% of pubic length (highly homoplasic
once taxa that aren't included by have long ischia like <i>Apsaravis</i>,
Hesperornithes and <i>Iaceornis</i> are taken into account);
metatarsal I not twisted. In addition, the ungual on manual digit II
excludes it from <i>Iaceornis</i>+Aves and lack of hypotarsal grooves
excludes it from Aves. Some other characters (e.g. open iliosacral
canals) are listed as avian (their neornithine) synapomorphies but not
considered here, as they are actually neognath characters which only
appear as avian characters since no palaeognaths were included.<br>
Thus there are about 29 valid characters excluding <i>Patagopteryx</i>
from Ornithurae, three additional characters excluding it from
Carinatae and six others exclude it from Aves.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Zhou and Zhang (2001)
named Yanornithidae and Yanornithiformes for <i>Yanornis</i>, while
placing <i>Yixianornis</i> in Chaoyangornithiformes. Clarke et al.
(2002) were the first to suggest placing the these taxa plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span> into a single clade
at their SVP talk, though this was not published until 2006. You et al.
(2006) independently coded <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i> and
found the taxa to form a monophyletic clade in some of their most
parsimonious trees, though in others <i>Yanornis</i> was more derived
and sister to <i>Apsaravis</i>. The monophyletic clade of <i>Yanornis</i>,
<i>Yixianornis</i> and/or <i>Songlingornis</i> has been called
Songlingornithidae by many recent authors, but here <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> is recovered as further
from Aves than <span style="font-style: italic;">Yixianornis</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span> based on
Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The paratype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span>
(IVPP V10996) has yet to be described but was figured by
Wang et al. (2020), who correctly noted "few diagnostic features can be
identified from this specimen" and referred it to Yanornithidae
indet..  Indeed no characters of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> can be
seen, so it is placed in Yanornithiformes indet. here.  <br>
Zheng et al. (2013) briefly described the feathers and pedal scales of
STM 9-5 which they referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
based on "carina approaching sternal anterior limit, scapula shorter
than humerus, pubic symphysis relatively long, distal tarsals fused to
metatarsals and metatarsals co-ossified proximally and distally, pedal
digits relatively short and robust, and proximal pedal phalanges
relatively long but unguals short", but these are also present (where
known) in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> and
no characters distinguishing the taxa can be seen in STM 9-5.  It
is referred to Yanornithiformes indet. here.<br>
Zheng et al. (2014) figured STM 9-18, which although poorly prepared
appears to have a short manual phalanx II-1 like <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> (48% of
carpometacarpal length versus 67%) but an unexpanded procoracoid
process like <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>. 
Dentary morphology should be
scorable but is not determinable in the figure.  This should help
support potential hypotheses such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>'
elongate phalanx
or unexpanded procoracoid process being individual variation, or even
synonymy of the genera.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Wang et al., 2020b) dentary with [more] vertically oriented
anterior margin (actually about 61-64 degrees in the holotype, 68
percent in IVPP V12444 and
60-63 degrees in IVPP V13358 versus about 42-50 degrees in
<span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>); synsacrum
with ventral groove<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>; coracoid
with distally expanded procoracoid process (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Schizooura, Yixianornis</span>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou and Zhang (2001) listed several characters
in their diagnosis. A straight dentary is also present in <i>Songlingornis</i>,
<i>Ichthyornis</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>
and hesperornithids. According to their figure, the dentary is only 43%
of skull length (which is similar to other basal euornithines), not
66%. The number of dentary teeth (20) is similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> (~20) and <i>Ichthyornis</i>
(21-24). Elongate cervical vertebrae are also present in <i>Patagopteryx</i>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>,
hesperornithines and ambiortiforms. While stated to be heterocoelous by
Zhou and Zhang (2001), the cervicals were coded as semiheterocoelous by
Zhou and Zhang (2005) and amphicelous by Clarke et al. (2006). Their
true state remains to be determined. A synsacrum with nine vertebrae is
also known in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>,
<i>Mengciusornis, Yixianornis</i> and <i>Patagopteryx</i>. The short
pygostyle is similar to most euornithines. Posterior sternal fenestrae
are present in <i>Piscivoravis, Iteravis, Gansus, Yixianornis</i> and <i>Songlingornis</i>
as well. The posterolateral sternal process is not distally
semicircular, but rather slightly convex as in <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>.
A forelimb/hindlimb ratio (hum+uln+carp/fem+tib+tars) of ~110%
(actually 106-122%) is also present in<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> (107%). 
The manus is shorter than the ulna, but contra Zhou and Zhang is not
shorter than the radius. In any case, the carpometacarpo-ulnar ratio
(43-49%) is very similar to <span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> (46%), <i>Yixianornis</i>
(42%), <i>Patagopteryx</i> (44%), <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> (45%), and <i>Gansus</i>
(48%). The tarsometatarsus is completely fused in almost all
euornithiness. The third pedal digit is similar in length (107-115% of
tarsometatarsal length) to <i>Patagopteryx</i> (~106%) and <i>Gansus</i>
(102-116%). Proximal pedal phalanges are longer and more robust than
distal phalanges in other basal euornithines where known.<br>
Czerkas and Xu (2002) diagnosed <i>Archaeovolans</i> based on several
characters. The number of premaxillary teeth (four) is plesiomorphic,
as is them being larger than dentary teeth. The large number of dentary
teeth (at least eighteen) is dealt with above. While they claim
uncinate processes were absent, the ribcage is only partially
articulated and has several small transverse elements which could be
uncinates. The "strikingly modern" pectoral girdle is vague but is
shared with more derived birds in any case. The supposedly short
sternal keel as illustrated is not present in the specimen, which shows
an elongate keel as in other <i>Yanornis</i> specimens and basal
euornithines. The scapholunare and pisiform are said to be "well
developed", but this is vague and they are comparable to other basal
euornithines. The lack of a long ventral ramus is plesiomorphic and
shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>, <i>Yixianornis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i>. Finally, the lack of a projected ventral carpal
trochlea is plesiomorphic and shared with other basal euornithines such
as <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Patagopteryx</i>. <br>
Clarke et al. (2006) listed humerus longer than scapula as diagnostic,
but this is present in all basal euornithines except <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yixianornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Apsaravis</span>.<br>
Wang et al. (2020b) listed several characters differing from their new
yanornithiforms <span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span>
(here synonymized with <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>)
and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>
but a premaxillary body anterior to the naris shorter than the
subnarial process of the premaxilla is not present in some specimens
(e.g. xhpm1205).   Two sternal characters listed as differing from
<span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span>
are just adult characters compared to the latter and are present in
many other basal ornithouromorphs- sternum bearing a pair of
anterolateral processes (also in e.g.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Jianchangornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeorhynchus, </span>songlingornithids,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Yumenornis</span>); posterolateral
sternal processes distally expanded (also in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jianchangornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeorhynchus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Piscivoravis</span>, songlingornithids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yumenornis</span>; unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>).  An elongate
forelimb with an intermembral index
(hum+uln/fem+tib) of 1.27
only refers to the holotype, with the range of ratios actually
1.09-1.27, which overlaps 1.12 in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>. 
A bicipital crest of the humerus with a pit-shaped fossa [anteriorly]
is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis,
Jianchangornis, Schizooura, Iteravis </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Apsaravis</span>.<br>
<b>The "Archaeoraptor" debacle</b>- The specimen IVPP V12444 was
fraudulently combined with the tail of the <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>
holotype by a Chinese farmer. It was smuggled out of the country then
sold at the 1998 Tuscon Gem Show to Czerkas. Currie recognized the legs
were part and counterpart slabs of the same bones, while Rowe and
Aulenback independently verified the composite nature of the specimen.
National Geographic announced the specimen in a press conference in
October, and in November, Sloan (1999) published a paper using the name
"Archaeoraptor liaoningensis". This was a nomen nudum because it
explicitely stated the taxon was to be described formerly in an
official publication. That official publication was to have been in
Science or Nature, but both journals rejected it. In April, Olson
(2000) published an article purporting to officially describe
"Archaeoraptor" and attach that name to the dromaeosaurid tail (with
the latter as the lectotype). Several months later in December, Xu et
al. (2000) officially named <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i> based on the
dromaeosaurid tail and associated anterior part of the skeleton Xu had
discovered. At this time, Olshevsky (DML, 2000) noted that Olson's
publication predated Xu et al.'s, and he believed that this made <i>Microraptor</i>
a junior synonym of "Archaeoraptor". Several days later, Creisler (DML,
2001) pointed out the Olson's attempt to name "Archaeoraptor" was
invalid because the ICZN requires a diagnosis in a valid publication,
while Olson merely referenced the invalid article by Sloan. Creisler
further indicated Olson cannot designate a lectotype without a valid
publication defining a holotype first. Thus "Archaeoraptor" is still a
nomen nudum, despite Olson's efforts, and <i>Microraptor zhaoianus</i>
is the valid name for the IVPP V 12330 dromaeosaurid. The specimen was
returned to the IVPP in May, 2000 and Zhou and Zhang were asked to work
on the euornithine section. They noticed the similarity with <i>Yanornis</i>
shortly before completing their paper on that taxon in December 2000.
Rowe et al. (2001) detailed the composite nature of the specimen,
recognizing it was from at least two, and possibly up to five animals.
They noted the euornithine section (IVPP V 12444) was to be described
by Xu (in prep.), which later appeared as Czerkas and Xu (2002). These
authors described the specimen as a new taxon of euornithine (as
Ornithurae) bird- <i>Archaeovolans repatriates</i>. Czerkas and Xu
noted in an addendum that the recently described <i>Yanornis martini</i>
was extremely similar and might be congeneric, though they also thought
differences were present. Zhou et al. published their work in 2002,
noting that both anatomy and proportions were nearly identical in the
holotypes for the two species and synonymized them. Given the recent
description of  <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>,
IVPP V12444 can be referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
based on the vertical anterior dentary margin, expanded procoracoid
process (also noted by Wang et al., 2020b), and lack of <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>'
enlarged anterior dentary tooth, anterior dentary foramen, and elongate
manual phalanx II-1 (46% of carpometacarpus versus 67% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>).  While Rowe
et al. found no evidence the right femur and both tibiotarsi, fibulae
and pes belong to the same individual as the body, Zhou et al. (2002)
confirmed they do. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Yanornis gouzhangi</span>-
Wang et al. (2013) described a supposedly new <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> species, <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. guozhangi</span>, based on complete
skeleton xhpm1205.  Contra their diagnosis, the "large and strong
deltoid crest, which is almost half the length of the shaft" is the
same as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span>. 
The pubic symphysis is noted to be shorter than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. martini</span> holotype, at 24%
compared to 35%, but it falls within the range of variation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. martini</span>
with LHZA02-0008 having a 37% ratio and IVPP V13259 having a 21%
ratio.  The fibula was stated to be longer, at "2/3 the length of
the
tibiotarsus" (actual ratio 65%) compared to 39% in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. martini</span>
holotype.  Most specimens cannot be checked but the ratio in
LHZA02-0008 is 28% and that of IVPP V14606 at least 39%.  Wang et
al.
state "the tarsometatarsus is short and completely fused, less than
half the length of the tibiotarsus", but all euornithines have
completely fused tarsometatarsi and the tarsometatarsotibiotarsal ratio
(49%) is actually greater than the ratio in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. martini</span>
type (46%) and falls within the range of other specimens
(49-54%). 
With the longer fibula being the only valid proposed difference, <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. guozhangi</span> is synonymized with <span style="font-style: italic;">Y. martini</span>.  It also shares <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>' dentary with a 
vertically oriented anterior margin and lacks <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>'
large anterior dentary tooth and long manual phalanx II-1 (67% of
carpometacarpus versus 42% in xhpm1205).  Wang et al. reached the
same conclusion, stating "all of the features originally used to
diagnose this taxon are present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis
martini</span>",
"putative differences between these two taxa pertain to subtle limb
proportions" and "our re-examination indicates that the former is
morphologically identical to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis
martini</span>."<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span>-
Liu (2008) described IVPP V14606 in their thesis as an example of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span>. 
It was later described by Wang et al. (2020b) as a new taxon of
yanornithid, <span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis lii</span>. 
However, most of their listed
diagnostic characters compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
are flawed.  Two
characters are listed as differing from <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>, but being
shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>-
synsacrum bearing a ventral groove; coracoid with
distally expanded procoracoid process.  Wang et al. also list
intercotylar eminence of tarsometatarsus absent
in their diagnosis, but the weak convexity is only slightly less
prominent than in <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>
while <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
(e.g. IVPP V12558, xhpm1205) lacks any convexity.  A distal
vascular
foramen which is proximally located is listed in supposed contrast with
<span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>, but the
labeled distal vascular foramen in the latter is just the gap between
trochlea III and IV also seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span>. 
The area around the true distal vascular foramen is too poorly
preserved to score in other yanornithiforms.  They also list
margins of 
pedal ungual flexor tubercles step-like instead of circular but this is
similar to some <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
(e.g. IVPP V13358) so is probably individual variation.  Two
sternal characters (sternum without anterolateral processes;
posterolateral processes of sternum not expanded distally) are typical
of young ornithothoracines, which agrees with the smaller size of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span> (humerus 88% of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> holotype).  Notably
the
intermediate-sized IVPP V12444 (92%) only has slightly expanded
posterolateral processes.  The supposed posterodorsally elongate
retroarticular process strongly reseembles the medial articular process
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>, down to the
slight anteromedial convexity for the
medial condyle, suggesting the posterior mandible rotated into ventral
exposure.  This would not differ from <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
specimens preserved
in lateral view but is similar to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>
type as
interpreted by Liu.  The synsacrum having one less vertebra
incorporated than the <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
holotype is a character known to vary
individually in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>. 
The potentially most diagnostic character is the paired M. cranialis
tibialis tubercles on metatarsals II and III, unlike the <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
holotype with its proximodistally poorly defined tubercle on metatarsal
II and at best very small tubercles on metatarsal III.  Given the
individual variation in other Mesozoic birds, this is considered
insufficient to support a new species, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis lii</span> is here placed as a
junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span>. 
<br>
Zhou et al. (2002) stated "a recently discovered specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
(IVPP V13259) contains preserved macerated fish remains, including a
teleost vertebra, fin rays and opercular fragments" and figured a small
section of it.  Wang et al. (2020b) referred it to their new taxon
<span style="font-style: italic;">Abitusavis</span>
based on the intermembral index (hum+uln/fem+tib of 1.20 in both),
femoral/tibiotarsal ratio (0.78 vs. 0.77 in holotype) and absent
intercotylar eminence.  However, the ratios fall within the range
of variation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
while the intercotylar eminence is also absent in that taxon as noted
above.  It is assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
here based on the short manual phalanx II-1 unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>.<br>
<b>Referred specimens</b>-
The paratype (IVPP V10996) has yet to be described but was figured by
Wang et al. (2020b), who correctly noted "few diagnostic features can
be
identified from this specimen" and referred it to Yanornithidae
indet..  Indeed no characters of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> can be
seen, so it is placed in Yanornithiformes indet. here.  <br>
Yuan (2004) described another specimen (LHZA02-0008) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span> which is notable
in having four phalanges on each pedal digit II and a specimen of the
osteoglossomorph <i>Jinanichthys</i> in its mouth.  It is not <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>
based on the lack of an enlarged dentary tooth and short manual phalanx
II-1 (54% of carpometacarpus), so is referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> here.  <br>
Zhou et al. (2004) briefly described a specimen with gastroliths (IVPP
V13358), which was later illustrated by Zhou and Zhang (2006) and
mentioned another specimen (IVPP V13278) which was later made the
holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis
brevipectus</span>.  Wang et al. (2020b) correctly concluded IVPP
V13358 was <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> instead
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> based on
the more vertical anterior dentary edge, lack of <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span>' enlarged dentary
tooth and anterior foramen and short manual phalanx II-1.<br>
Zheng et al. (2013) briefly described STM 9-5 which they referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>, but it is referred to
Yanornithiformes indet. here.<br>
Zheng et al. (2014) described fish remains in ten new specimens. Of
these, note STM 9-52 has only one large phalanx in digit II of its
right manus, which if not a developmental anomaly is likely to be a
forgery. Most of right pedal digit III seems to be fake, lending
credence to the latter possibility. Wang et al. (2020b) stated "until
adequate preparation and detailed comparative study are conducted, we
suggest the aforementioned 10 specimens are tentatively referred to
Yanornithidae indet."  However, STM 9-15, 9-19, 9-46, 9-49 and
9-52 can be tentatively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
based on the short manual phalanx II-1 (46%, ~45%, 48%, ~53% and 52% of
carpometacarpus respectively; but see STM 9-18), while STM 9-26 can be
referred to it based on the more vertical anterior dentary margin and
lack of an enlarged tooth, STM 9-37 based on the lack of an enlarged
anterior dentary tooth and short phalanx II-1 (48%).  STM 9-18,
9-31 and 9-51 are placed in Yanornithiformes indet. here though, with
the caveat 9-18 appears to show a mix of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis</span> characters.<br>
Wang et al. (2020) described the hsitology of IMMNH-PV00021 (perhaps
from Inner Mongolia like IVPP V14606 based on it being in the Inner
Mongolia Museum of Natural<br>
History) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>, which
it may be based on the short manual phalanx II-1 (~51% of
carpometacarpal length).<br>
<b>Miscoded originally?</b> Zhou and Zhang (2005) were the first
authors to code <i>Yanornis</i>, but You et al. (2006) changed
numerous codings based on personal observation of the holotype by
Chiappe and O'Connor. Clarke et al. (2006) later coded <i>Yanornis</i>
again based on the holotype, IVPP V12444, V13259 <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> and V13358. These include making
the following states uncertain- anterior premaxillary fusion (stated to
be present by Zhou et al., 2002 and coded so by Clarke et al.); fusion
of frontoparietal suture (appears absent in the figure of the holotype;
also uncertain in Clarke et al.); quadrate pneumaticity including
cluster of foramina on dorsal process (also uncertain in Clarke et
al.); presence of external mandibular fenestra (appears absent in the
figure of the holotype; also uncertain in Clarke et al.); coely of

surface (stated to be deeply concave distally by Zhou and Zhang, 2001;
coded as flat by Clarke et al.); pneumaticity of coracoid (coded as

scapula and coracoid (less than 90 degrees in IVPP V13358; coded as
such by Clarke et al.); length of acromion (illustrated as long in the
holotype, but as short in IVPP V12444 and V13358; coded as long by
Clarke et al.); curvature of acromion (stated to be curved by Zhou et
al., 2002; coded as straight by Clarke et al.); presence and morphology
of capital groove and ventral tubercle (also uncertain in Clarke et
al.; all specimens seem to be preserved with humeri in anterior view);
presence of anterior concavity on humeral head (actually already coded
unknown by Zhou and Zhang, 2005; but coded absent by Clarke et al.);
development of bicipital crest (stated to be ball-shaped by Zhou and
Zhang, 2001 and well developed by Czerkas and Xu; coded as enlarged by
Zhou and Zhang and moderate by Clarke et al.); presence of brachial
fossa on humerus (also uncertain in Clarke et al.); demarkation of
muscle origins on the dorsodistal humerus (also uncertain in Clarke et
al.); presence of scapulotricipital and humerotricipital grooves (also
uncertain in Clarke et al.; all specimens seem to be preserved with
humeri in anterior view); separation of ulnar cotyla (also uncertain in
Clarke et al.); semilunar morphology of dorsal ulnar condyle (visible
in IVPP V12444; stated to be present by Zhou and Zhang, 2001 and coded
as such by Clarke et al.); morphology of ventroposterior surface of
radius (apparently grooved in both IVPP V12444 and V13358; coded as
flat or scarred by Clarke et al.); length of pisiform rami (poorly
developed in IVPP V12444 and coded as such by Clarke et al.);
comparative lengths of dorsal and ventral pisiform rami (coded as
subequal by Clarke et al.); width of metacarpal III (is approximately
50% in the holotype and IVPP V12444; seems much narrower in Zhou and
Zhang's illustration of IVPP V13358, but is wider in the photo; coded
as narrower by Clarke et al.); convexity of medial metacarpal I edge
(concave in IVPP V12444; also coded uncertain in Clarke et al.);
presence of internal index process of manual phalanx II-2 (absent in
IVPP V13358 and coded as such by Clarke et al.); dorsal fusion of ilia
(clearly absent in the holotype and coded as such by Clarke et al.);

presence of posterior trochanter (also coded uncertain in Clarke et
al.); fusion of tibiotarsus (coded as completely fused by Clarke et
al.); comparative anterior projection of tibiotarsal condyles (also
coded uncertain in Clarke et al.); presence of supratendinal groove

intercondylar groove in distal view (coded as wide by Clarke et al.);
extent of cartilaginous tibial sulcus (actually already coded unknown
by Zhou and Zhang, 2005); distal tibiotarsal width compared to midshaft
width (coded as subequal by Clarke et al., but this seems untrue in
most birds including <i>Yanornis</i>, making interpretation of
Clarke's character problematic); distal contact between fibula and
tarsus (absent in all specimens; as coded by Clarke et al.); hypotarsal
development (coded as absent or lacking crests and foramina by Clarke
et al.); development of fossa for metatarsal I (also coded uncertain in
Clarke et al.); ginglymoidy of metatarsal II (seems rounded in IVPP
V13358); relative transverse width of metatarsals (subequal in IVPP
V13358 and coded as such by Clarke et al.); number of distal vascular
foramen exits in tarsometatarsus (also coded uncertain in Clarke et
al.).<br>
They also changed several codings- dentary symphysis without broad
dorsally facing surface (which agrees with Czerkas and Xu, 2002);
posterior dentary unforked (as it appears in the figure of the
holotype); Meckelian groove not covered by splenial (which agrees with
Czerkas and Xu, 2002); presence of lateral foramina in the dorsal
centra (though described as pleurocoels by Zhou and Zhang and Czerkas
and Xu, their size makes them more likely to be fossae as coded by
Clarke et al.); lateral coracoid process absent (illustrated as present
by Zhou and Zhang, 2001 and Zhou et al., 2002; coded as present by
Clarke et al., 2006); ulna shorter than humerus (longer in specimens
with exactly measured elements; as coded by Clarke et al.); dorsal
ulnar cotyla not convex (coded uncertain by Clarke et al.); ulnar
brachial scar present (also coded as present by Clarke et al.);
intermetacarpal space reaches proximally to metacarpal I (present in
all specimens; as coded by Clarke et al.); manual phalanx II-2 shorter
than II-1 (coded as longer by Clarke et al., but actually varies from
97-106%, making it polymorphic); one proximal vascular foramen in
tarsometatarsus (coded uncertain by Clarke et al.); metatarsal I
straight (coded as curved by Clarke et al.); laterally placed m.
tibialis cranialis tubercle on tarsometatarsus (as coded by Clarke et
al.); metatarsal trochlea II subequal or wider than trochlea III and/or
IV (Zhang and Zhou, 2001 state metatarsal II's trochlea is intermediate
in width between III and IV; which state this represents is confusing,
as Clarke's character has states compared to trochlea III AND/OR IV, so
it agrees with parts of states 1 and 2); metatarsal II shorter than
metatarsal IV, but reaching distally farther than base of metatarsal IV
trochlea (as coded by Clarke et al; while Zhou and Zhang's illustration
appears to show subequal lengths, their text states II is shorter).<br>

first dentary tooth hypertrophied; tapered procoracoid process on
coracoid; manual phalanx II-1 over two-thirds of carpometacarpus length
(67% vs. 42-52% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Wang et al.
(2020) listed a lateral foramen at the anterior tip of the premaxilla,
but this is also present in some <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
(e.g. xhpm1205)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. 
A subnarial process of the premaxilla shorter than the premaxillary
body anterior to the naris was said to be diagnostic, but is also
present in some <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
(IVPP V13259, xhpm1205).  Contra their statement "The lacrimal is
poorly
preserved in all the specimens that can be confidently referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">martini</span>", the supposedly
diagnostic T-shaped lacrimal bearing a slender
posterodorsal process is also present in xhpm1205<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.  They listed two surangular
foramina as diagnostic, but <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
may have these as well based on xhpm1205.  They stated
cervical prezygapophyses longer than postzygapophyses as diagnostic,
but this is only visible in two anterior cervicals and absent in the
last preserved cervical, comparable to IVPP V13259 where two anterior
cervicals have longer prezygapophyses, a
mid cervical is intermediate and three posterior cervicals have longer
postzygapophyses.  A large femorotibiotarsal ratio of 85% was
listed as diagnostic, but while the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> has a 68% ratio, other
specimens have ratios of 81% (xhpm1205) and 85% (IVPP V12444)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. 
Wang et al. listed bicipital crest of humerus without a pit-shaped
fossa but the right humerus seems to have an anterior fossa, albeit
larger and more triangular than <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>'
holotype.  They also listed an enlarged flexor tuber of pedal
ungual IV, but this minor difference is similar to some <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> (e.g. xhpm1205) but not
others (e.g. IVPP V13358) so is probably individual variation.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Zhou et al. (2004)
first mention IVPP V13278 as one of the several <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis martini</span>
"completely, or partially, articulated specimens with minimal or no
evidence of postmortem disturbance. No gastroliths are known from any
of these specimens."  Liu (2008) described this as a new species
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Y</span>. "brevipectis", in their MS
thesis.  Wang et al. (2020) officially described it as a new genus
as well, <span style="font-style: italic;">Similiyanornis brevipectus</span>. 
Differences in interpretation from the thesis include longer
posterodorsal premaxillary processes, reidentifying the mesethmoid as a
lacrimal, recognizing a mandible without an external fenestra, and
recognizing the sternum is broken posteriorly instead of being shorter
than in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> (despite
retaining a version of its original species name "brevipectis"). 
Notably, Liu's Table 3.1 shows the forelimb measurements in Wang et al.
are averages of right and left sides.<br>

<b>Cretaceous<br>
Wallace County, Kansas, US</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (YPM 1760) partial synsacrum (~17 mm)<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Clarke (2004) distinguished this taxon from <i>Ichthyornis</i>
based on two characters. The first is the presence of parapophyses on
the first sacral, which are also found in <i>Gansus</i> and Aves. The
second is the presence of wider iliosacral sulci, but this is also seen
in <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Gargantuavis</i>, <i>Zhyraornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>.
<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1880) named this as a new species of <i>Ichthyornis</i>
based on a synsacrum discovered in 1879, but never illustrated or
described the species. He referred a distal humerus (YPM 1738) and
coracoid (YPM 1766) to <i>Ichthyornis tener</i> without comment, but
Clarke (2004) showed these are referrable to <i>I. </i><i>dispar</i>.
Brodkorb (1967) incorrectly believed the humerus was YPM 1760, as Marsh
never states which element YPM 1760 is and references a figure of the
humerus. Clarke (2002) removed the holotype from <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and described it as the new genus "Guildavis", which was published by
her in 2004. Clarke noted <i>Guildavis</i> could not be compared to
the probably contemporaneous <i>Apatornis</i> and <i>Iaceornis</i>
besides being smaller, so may be synonymous with either of these taxa.<br>
Clarke (2004) found <i>Guildavis</i> to be more derived than <i>Ichthyornis</i>
based on the parapophysis on the first sacral, but this is now known to
be present in the more basal <i>Gansus</i> as well. Similarly, Clarke
found <i>Guildavis</i> to be excluded from Aves due to its
amphicoelous anterior sacral articular surface, but some crown birds
including most charadriiforms have this as well, and Clarke did not
include any neoavians in her analysis.<br>

= Yixianorniformes Zhang and Zhou, 2006 <br>
= Yixianornithidae Zhang and Zhou, 2006<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Clarke et al. (2006) found four characters to
unambiguously diagnose this clade in a version including <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> has not been shown to lack
completely heterocoelous cervicals. A posteromedial sternal process
joining distally to the posteromedian process to form a fenestra is
also seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Piscivoravis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Iteravis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>.  A procoracoid process
is now known in all basal euornithines except <i>Patagopteryx</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>.
The lack of a medially concave coracoid surface (where the
supracoracoid foramen exits if it is present) is more parsimoniously
primitive to euornithines, as it is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bellulornis</span> and <i>Arcaheornithura,</i>
while the concavity in <i>Apsaravis</i> is considered a reversal. <br>
Zhou and Zhang's (2006) diagnosis for <i>Yixianornis</i>' eponymous
family and order was the same as their 2001 diagnosis for the genus.
Most of those characters are apomorphic for <i>Yixianornis</i> or
otherwise problematic (see <i>Yixianornis</i>
diagnosis), except the femoro-tarsometatarsal ratio of ~150-170%, which
is also present in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Jianchangornis</span>
(162-169%), <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeorhynchus</span>
(164-185%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Piscivoravis</span>
(157%).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Hou (1997) originally named Songlingornithidae for <i>Songlingornis</i>
within the Chaoyangiformes, while Zhou and Zhang (2001) later placed <i>Yixianornis</i>
in Chaoyangornithiformes. Zhou and Zhang (2006) created
Yixianornithidae and Yixianornithiformes for <i>Yixianornis</i>, and
placed <i>Songlingornis</i> in the Chaoyangornithiformes and
"Chaoyangornithidae". Clarke et al. (2002) were the first to suggest
placing these taxa and <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span>
into a single clade at their SVP talk, though this was not published
until 2006. You et al. (2006) independently coded <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>
and found the taxa to form a monophyletic clade in some of their most
parsimonious trees, though in others <i>Yanornis</i> was more derived
and sister to <i>Apsaravis</i>. The monophyletic clade of <i>Yanornis</i>,
<i>Yixianornis</i> and/or <i>Songlingornis</i> has been called
Songlingornithidae by many recent authors, but here <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanornis</span> is recovered as further
from Aves than <span style="font-style: italic;">Yixianornis</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span> based on

feathers, eleven remiges (to 67 mm), eight retrices (~75-~92 mm) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhou and Zhang, 2001) snout anterior to
frontal margin of orbit 41% of skull length; metacarpal III 32% the
width of metacarpal II (unknown in <i>Songlingornis</i>); pubic
symphysis ~16% the length of pubis (unknown in <i>Songlingornis</i>);
ratio of pedal digit III to tarsometatarsus length 128% (unknown in <i>Songlingornis</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou and Zhang (2001) included a few other
characters in their diagnosis. The short snout was expressed as a ratio
of skull length to width (stated to be 150%, but in actuality 175% as
preserved). However, the width is exaggerated by crushing the mandibles
and jugals laterally, and the true ratio based on the postorbital
processes is 235%. This makes it probably comparable to <i>Hongshanornis</i>,
and <i>Songlingornis</i> is probably also short-snouted based on its
dentary proportions, though difficult to quantify thanks to a lack of
posterior skull material and good illustration. Clarke et al. (2006)
use another measure of this feature, namely dentary length, which they
state is shorter than in <i>Songlingornis</i>. One measure which can
be compared in both <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i> is
length anterior to the frontal margin of the orbit, which is shorter in
<i>Yixianornis</i> (41% vs. 51%). It could be assumed <i>Songlingornis</i>'
apparently longer dentary indicates it had a larger ratio. "Postcranial
long bones slender" is unspecific and unquantified, but seems to be
even more true of <i>Hongshanornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>. Most
euornithines have protruding elliptical humeral heads. While Zhou and
Zhang use a pubic symphysis length of 20% pubic length in their
diagnosis, their measurement table indicates a ratio of 26%, and Clarke
et al.'s measurements indicate a smaller ratio of 16% (based on a pubis
estimated to be 7 mm longer). While the proximal pubis is hidden by the
femur, I find Clarke et al.'s estimate more likely based on the general
length of basal bird pubic peduncles. The femoro-tarsometatarsal ratio
(stated to be 160%, but actually 152%) is overlapped by <i>Yanornis</i>
(149-170%).<br>
Clarke et al. state the xiphoid process (just posterior to the costal
margin) of the sternum has a greater extent along the sternal margin
than in <i>Yanornis</i> or <i>Songlingornis</i>, but that of <i>Hongshanornis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i> are longer (<i>Songlingornis</i>' seems to be also,
at least in Hou's illustration). They also stated the interclavicular
angle was longer than in <i>Yanornis</i> or <i>Songlingornis</i>, but
this is also true in <i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and
<i>Gansus</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype is misidentified as IVPP V13631 in Clarke
et al.'s (2006) redescription. Their measurement of 12.5 mm for pedal
phalanx IV-1 is also in error.<br>

Holotype-</b> (IVPP V10913) (~190 mm) premaxilla, maxilla, nasals,
quadrate, mandibles (25.5 mm), cervical vertebrae, several dorsal
vertebrae, two dorsal ribs (31 mm), two dorsal rib fragments, scapula,
coracoids (22.5 mm), furcula, sternum (35 mm), proximal radius, distal
ulnae, carpometacarpus (25 mm), proximal femur, partial tarsometatarsus?<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Hou, 1997) dorsal edge of scapula almost
straight.<br>
(after Clarke et al., 2006) width of distal expansion of posterolateral
sternal process 28% of sternal length.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Hou (1997) included numerous characters in his
diagnosis, but many are vague (mandible slender and elongate; ribs
slender and elongate; well developed coracoid head; relatively well
developed carpometacarpus; well developed femoral head) or primitive
(dorsal vertebrae not heterocoelous; concave coracoid facet for
scapula; procoracoid process present; supracoracoid foramen present;
distal fossa on posterior coracoid; hypocleidium absent; elongate and
broad sternum; deep coracoid grooves on sternum; distinct sternal
carina). Others are found in other songlingornithids (teeth closely
packed; more than nine dentary teeth; large anterolateral sternal
process; well developed xiphoid sternal process; posterolateral sternal
process with expanded tip; posterolateral sternal process extends
posteriorly far beyond posteromedian process; posteromedial sternal
process joins distally to posteromedian process forming fenestra).While
Hou says the sternal rostrum ("manubrium") is well developed in the
diagnosis, he later states it is damaged and cannot be described. <br>
Zhou and Hou (2002) diagnose <i>Chaoyangia</i> partly using characters
from <i>Songlingornis</i>. Most of the characters are repeated from
Hou's earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">Songlingornis</span>
diagnosis. The remainder are plesiomorphic (premaxillary and dentary
teeth present; U-shaped furcula; sternal keel extends along full length
of sternum; short posterolateral sternal process).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was collected in 1992 and mentioned by
Zhou (1995) as being probably referrable to <i>Chaoyangia</i>. Hou et
al. (1995) say it is at least referrable to Euornithes (their
Ornithurae), and later (1996) refer it to <i>Chaoyangia</i> due to the
similar size and rarity of euornithine birds in the deposits. Hou
(1997) described it as the new taxon <i>Songlingornis linghensis</i>,
while Zhou and Hou (2002) referred it to <i>Chaoyangia</i> but did
indicate it had also been used as the holotype of <i>Songlingornis</i>.
The holotypes of both specimens preserve few elements in common (though
not none, as claimed by Clarke and Norell, 2001)- several dorsal
vertebrae, dorsal ribs and proximal femur. The dorsals are alike in
being non-heterocoelous, but this is similar to all
non-hesperornithine, non-avian birds. Both femora are described as
having proximally projecting trochanteric crests, shallow trochanteric
fossae and large heads. These features are comparable to many basal
birds including <i>Confuciusornis</i> and <i>Vorona</i>. The only
point of difference in their descriptions in that <i>Chaoyangia</i> is
said to have a "basically absent" neck, while <i>Songlingornis</i> has
a "relatively well developed neck." Yet <i>Chaoyangia</i>'s proximal
femur has a near identical shape to <i>Patagopteryx</i>'s, which has a
neck, and <i>Songlingornis</i>' illustration is too schematic for
proper comparison. Thus the taxa cannot be distinguished, but also
share no synapomorphies that would allow them to be synonymized.<br>
<i>Songlingornis</i> was originally described as a basal euornithine
(Ornithurae of Hou) by Hou (1997), placed on his phylogram more derived
than <i>Liaoningornis</i> but less than <i>Gansus</i> and Ornithurae
sensu Chiappe. Clarke (2002) was the first author to include the taxon
in a cladistic analysis, finding it to be a carinate in an unresolved
polytomy with <i>Ichthyornis</i> and more derived birds. More
recently, Clarke et al. included <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>
in their matrix and found <i>Songlingornis</i> to clade with these
taxa in a group more derived than <i>Patagopteryx</i>, but less than <i>Apsaravis</i>
and Ornithurae. This was first announced at their SVP 2002 talk, but
only published in 2006.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Kurochkin (1982) established the monotypic
Ambiortiformes and Ambiortidae, but later (1999) assigned <i>Otogornis</i>
to the Ambiortiformes as well, and even later (2000) to the
Ambiortidae. This was based on several problematic characters. The
acrocoracoid of <i>Otogornis</i> is not noticably thicker than <i>Enantiornis</i>,
which also shares the "three edged" morphology. The proximal tip of <i>Otogornis</i>'
acrocoracoid is not necessarily acute (compare medial view of left
coracoid to other figures). The glenoid on the scapula is no wider in <i>Ambiortus</i>
than <i>Enantiornis</i> and appears concave in Hou's original
illustration, but is flat in some enantiornithines (e.g. <i>Gobipteryx</i>)
anyway. <i>Otogornis</i>' humeral head is no more ventrally placed
than <i>Sinornis</i>', and is not smaller or shorter. Nor is it oval,
having a proximally concave margin as in enantiornithines. Finally, the
long and thin manual phalanx II-2 is symplesiomorphic, being found in
most basal birds. <i>Otogornis</i>
seems to be an enantiornithine instead. Martyniuk (2012) later defined
the clade.  Ambiortes was created by Zelenkov in a book chapter by
Zelenkov and Kurochkin (2015) to only include Ambiortiformes.<br>
Zhou and Zhang (2006) listed Gansuiornithiformes and
"Gansuiornithidae", which are incorrectly formed as there is no genus
"Gansuiornis". Furthermore, "Gansuiornithidae" is a nomen nudum since
it was not defined or diagnosed (ICZN Article 13.1.1).<br>
Wang et al. (2025) defined  Gansuidae as &quot;The most inclusive clade containing <em>Gansus yumenensis</em> but not <em>Hesperornis regalis</em>, <em>Hongshanornis longicresta</em>, <em>Patagopteryx deferrariisi</em>, <em>Songlingornis linghensis</em>, <em>Vultur gryphus</em> or <em>Yanornis martini</em>&quot;, including <em>Changzuiornis</em>, <em>Gansus</em>, <em>Iteravis</em>, <em>Khinganornis</em>,<em>Shuilingornis</em> and tentatively <em>Hollanda</em> based on Cau's matrix.&nbsp; Thus it has a largely different content than Ambiortiformes on this site.&nbsp; They diagnosed it based on- alveolar margin of dentary subparallel to ventral margin in side view; widely spaced teeth in mid-dentary (distance between alveoli  larger than mesiodistal diameter of alveolus); anterior margin of sternum angular; straight metacarpal III bounding slit-like intermetacarpal space; pubis distal end with prominent posterior projection; medial condyle of tibiotarsus projected more anteriorly than lateral condyle; tarsometatarsus longer than 50% of tibiotarsus; distal end of metatarsal II not gynglymoid.<br>

most of twenty specimens including tarsometatarsi (32-36 mm) (Zhou,

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhou et al., 2014) ischium with concave
ventral margin and weak mid dorsal process (also in <i>Piscivoravis</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>).<br>
(modified after Liu et al., 2014) pedal digit IV subequal to 10% longer
than III, excluding unguals (also in <i>Schizooura</i> and some <i>Gansus</i>);
pedal unguals III and IV plesiomorphically lacking prominent pendant
flexor tubercle of <i>Gansus</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou et al. (2014) listed a number of
characters which are actually symplesiomorphic for <i>Gansus</i>-grade
euornithines- elongate premaxilla; toothless premaxilla; rostrum 50% of
skull length; ectethmoid bone lining anterior half of orbit; flexor
tubercle on posterior margin of manual phalanx III-1; pubes with
posteriorly expanded distal boot. They also listed "maxilla with
numerous teeth", but only "several" teeth are claimed to be present and
only a couple are visible, so this is plesiomorphic for euornithines
too. <br>
Liu et al. (2014) also diagnosed <i>Gansus zheni</i> using several
characters compared to <i>G. yumenensis</i> which are problematic. The
broader interclavicular angle (~45-~53 degrees, not 60 as Liu et al.
state) is found in several other basal euornithines, and almost all
basal euornithines have U-shaped furculae. Compared to <i>Gansus
yumenensis</i>, <i>zheni/Iteravis</i> actually has a longer cnemial
crest (8-15% of tibiotarsal length vs. 4%), a shorter manual digit II
(excluding ungual, 86-102% of metacarpal II length vs. 81-83%; same
ratio as several other basal euornithines), and overlapping pedal digit
III / tarsometatarsal ratios (excluding ungual, 89-97% vs. 74-101%;
same ratio as several other basal euornithines), contra Liu et al..<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Zhou et al. (2014) believed the Sihedang locality
which these specimens derive from to be in the Yixian Formation,
whereas Liu et al. (2014) believed it to be in the overlying Jiufotang
Formation. Zhou et al. cite undescribed turtles and a caudipterid as
being found in the locality, though both are known from both formations
(as <i>Similicaudipteryx</i> has been referred to Caudipteridae,
though it is near certainly more basal). The pterosaurs <i>Guidraco</i> and <i>Ikrandraco</i> are also from Sihedang however, referred to the
Jiufotang Formation in both descriptions. As <i>Ikrandraco</i> is also
known from another Jiufotang locality (Lamadong), the Jiufotang
Formation is favored here as the stratigraphic placement of <i>Iteravis</i>.<br>
Zhou et al. (2014) found <i>Iteravis</i> to be more derived than
hongshanornithids and songlingornithids, but outside hesperornithoids
and Aves. Liu et al. (2014) found it to be sister to <i>Gansus</i> <i>yumenensis</i>,
so they named it as a new species of that genus. The position used
here, just basal to <i>Gansus</i> and more derived birds, is based on
the partly corrected matrix of Liu et al. as described below and
coincidentally matches the first most parsimonious tree found by Zhou
et al. before they found more trees one step shorter. <br>
Note the main skeletal figures in Liu et al. (2014; figures 1 and 2)
have the specimen numbers switched, so figure 1 says its of BMNHC Ph
1342 but is actually of BMNHC Ph 1318, and the reverse is true of
figure 2. Also, Zhou et al. claim they used the data matrix of O'Connor
et al.'s 2011 redescription of <i>Rapaxavis</i>, but that paper has no
phylogenetic analysis. It seems they actually used the matrix of
O'Connor and Zelenkov's 2013 redescription of <i>Ambiortus</i> <br>
<b>Synonymization of <i>Iteravis hutchzermeyeri</i> and <i>Gansis
zheni</i></b>- Mortimer (online, 2014) proposed these two species of
basal euornithines from the same locality that were named within a
month of each other are actually synonyms. <i>Gansus zheni</i> has all
of <i>Iteravis</i>' diagnostic characters, including a toothless
premaxilla and apparent maxillary alveoli that were not noticed by Liu
et al. (2014). Similarly, <i>Iteravis</i> has all of <i>Gansus zheni</i>'s
supposed diagnostic characters as compared to <i>Gansus yumenensis</i>,
excluding those which are actually absent in <i>zheni</i> (see above). <br>
There are also several characters which differ in their descriptions. <i>zheni</i> is said to have a "small, rostrally tapered, and tear-shaped" external
naris (mistakenly cited as the internal naris), but given the odd
premaxillary shape in BMNHC Ph 1318, the premaxilla and maxilla are
probably crushed in largely ventral view (note several possible alveoli
in the maxilla and the deep bone under them which would be the palatal
shelf), artificially shortening and tapering the anterior narial edge.
Liu et al. state <i>zheni</i>'s naris posteriorly overlaps the
antorbital fenestra, which would barely be true in their
interpretation, while the labeled nasal fragment in <i>Iteravis</i> suggests this isn't so in that taxon. However, the antorbital fenestral
area in both specimens is a jumble of bone fragments and multicolored
sediment reflecting the fragile nature of that region in birds and the
separation of slabs which exposed it. Thus any edge of the fenestra is
impossible to identify exactly. Liu et al. claim "Unlike other Jehol
ornithuromorphs [including <i>Iteravis</i>] ... no pre-mandibular
ossification is visible in any of the two studied specimens." This
would be easily explainable by taphonomy as both skulls are rather
poorly preserved and the element is small and loosely connected to the
dentaries. Regardless, there are possible predentaries in each
specimen- contacting the premaxillae just in front of the dentary in
BMNHC Ph 1342 and attached to the left dentary tip projecting dorsally
in BMNHC Ph 1318.<br>
Liu et al. state <i>zheni</i> has "a broad ventral groove running
along the entire exposed surface" of the synsacrum, while Zhou et al.
state <i>Iteravis</i> has "a flat ventral surface". The latter seems
true, but the 'groove' in <i>zheni</i> seems to be the taphonomic
collapse of the hollow interior as seen in its tibiotarsi, humeri and
ulnae. Zhou et al. states <i>Iteravis</i> lacks "the cranial hook
present in <i>Gansus</i>", while it is clearly present in <i>zheni</i>'s
coracoids. Yet both coracoids are broken in this area in <i>Iteravis</i>,
and the left shows a depression in the matrix which seems to indicate
the hook's original presence. Liu et al. state <i>zheni</i> has a
"prominent and triangular-shaped laterocranial process", which is
absent in <i>Iteravis</i>. Yet this process is also absent in the
illustrated <i>zheni</i> specimens BMNHC Ph 1318 and 1342. Liu et al.
cites BMNHC Ph 1394 as having the process, but until this specimen is
illustrated, it can be considered polymorphic at best to misinterpreted
at worst. <i>zheni</i> is said to lack ossified uncinate processes,
whereas <i>Iteravis</i> is reported to preserve "one probable uncinate
process". All three specimens have ribcages which are only partly
articulated and exposed though, so its easily possible uncinate
processes are hidden if present in <i>zheni</i>, or that the one was
misidentified in <i>Iteravis</i>. Liu et al. state <i>zheni</i> has a
deltopectoral crest on the humerus "which extends more than one-third
the total length of the bone", while <i>Iteravis</i>' is described as
extending "the proximal one-third of the humerus", but the crest in the
latter is almost entirely covered by other elements so cannot be
measured. <i>Iteravis</i>' carpometacarpus is described as
incompletely fused versus completely fused in <i>zheni</i>, but the
specimen is slightly smaller than <i>zheni</i> specimens (humeri 97%
of BMNHC Ph 1318, 95-97% of BMNHC Ph 1342) so could be expected to have
less fusion. Liu et al. say <i>zheni</i> lacks an extensor process on
metacarpal I, while <i>Iteravis</i> is said to have a small extensor
process. Both taxa have the same morphology though, which is comparable
to the extensor flange of basal paravians and not the extensor process
of some euornithines. <br>
The authors give very different lengths for <i>Iteravis</i>' and <i>zheni</i>'s
cnemial crests (10 vs. 25% of tibiotarsal length), though the real
apparent values are 8% vs. 15%. The discrepancy largely seems due to <i>zheni</i>'s
tibiotarsi being preserved in anterior view, where the collapse of the
element causes a median groove that exaggerates structures on either
side such as the laterally placed cnemial crest. <i>Iteravis</i>'
right tibiotarsus is in medial view, but the left element is partially
covered by the sternum and has a taphonomic concavity that extends the
apparent length of the cnemial crest. <i>Iteravis</i>' fibula is
described as "just over half the length of the tibiotarsus", while <i>zheni</i>'s
is said to only extend "to nearly the midshaft of the tibia." In
reality, all specimens have distal ends hidden by the tibiotarsus so
cannot be exactly measured. Liu et al. state "the proximal phalanges of
all pedal digits are longer than any of their respective distal
phalanges" in <i>zheni</i>, while Zhou et al. say <i>Iteravis</i> has
a slightly longer II-2 than II-1. Their own measurement table shows <i>zheni</i> is polymorphic for this though. <i>Iteravis</i> is reported to have a
pedal digit IV shorter than III in contrast to <i>zheni</i>, but the
ratio excluding unguals is 110% in <i>Iteravis</i> vs. 99-106% in <i>zheni</i>.
So <i>Iteravis</i> actually has the longer digit IV, but there's more
variation in <i>zheni</i> than difference between it and <i>Iteravis</i>. <br>
Given the lack of difference between <i>Iteravis</i> and <i>zheni</i>,
they are near certainly synonyms. <i>Iteravis</i> was published online
October 29th vs. <i>zheni</i> on November 14th. Yet Zhou et al. didn't
include a ZooBank registration. So the physical publication time is
what counts, which is December 1. Thus <i>zheni</i> wins by 30 days.<br>
<b>Is <i>zheni</i> <i>Gansus</i>?</b> Liu et al. referred <i>zheni</i> to <i>Gansus</i> based on several characters. Of these, the hooked
omal projection on the coracoid's sternolateral process is polymorphic
in <i>Gansus</i> <i>yumenensis</i>, and the intermembral index
(humerus+ulna)/(femur+tibiotarsus) of 0.9-1.1 and pedal digit IV that
is longer than digit III are polymorphic in <i>zheni</i>. The
posteromedially curved posterolateral sternal process is more
accurately understood as a distal expansion of the posterolateral
process that is expanded medially but not much laterally. It is also
present in <i>Jiuquanornis</i>, <i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Jianchangornis</i>, <i>Yumenornis</i> and <i>Ambiortus</i>. A metatarsal II which extends
distally only as far as the base of IV's trochlea is a synapomorphy of
birds more derived than songlingornithids. Proximal pedal phalanges
which are longer than distal phalanges is true in almost every basal
euornithine, with <i>zheni</i> and <i>Gansus</i> ironically being the
only taxa with some discordant specimens (both in digit II). The
supposed absence of a coracoid foramen is untrue in IVPP V18958, so the
foramen may be hidden in the two BMNHC specimens or this may be
polymorphic in <i>zheni</i>. An intermetacarpal space terminating
distal to the distal end of metacarpal I is unreliable, as it varies
with metacarpal I length as well as how the laminar metacarpal III is
crushed in relation to metacarpal II. Some of these characters were
miscoded by Liu et al., and changing these ten miscodings (with <i>zheni</i> conservatively coded as polymorphic for the coracoid foramen) led to <i>zheni</i> being basal to <i>Gansus</i> and birds closer to the crown. Checking
which characters supported this, twenty-two additional miscodings were
discovered. Correcting these left <i>zheni</i> in this position,
supported only by its gastralia. Yet <i>Gansus</i> specimens may have
taphonomically lost their gastralia (e.g. no crania are connected to
any), so this isn't the greatest evidence. Enforcing <i>zheni</i> to
be <i>Gansus</i> results in trees one step longer, so is basically as
parsimonious. Thus neither position is well supported, and the new
combination <i>Iteravis zheni</i> is used until good evidence for
referring it to <i>Gansus</i> is presented. <br>

  <b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1981 and described by
  Hou and Liu (1984), who believed birds were divided into land and water
  clades, with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> ancestral to the former and <i>Gansus</i> ancestral to the latter (except hesperornithines). Hou (1997) placed it
  sister to Ornithurae in his phylogram, and redescribed the taxon. Hope
  (2002) believed the specimen to be an ornithurine, but not an avian.
  Clarke (2002) coded the holotype for her matrix, finding it to be a
  carinate more derived than <i>Ichthyornis</i>, but less than <i>Iaceornis</i> and Aves. She noted the specimen was poorly preserved and "glued into
  the slab after being removed and repaired, obscuring almost all
  morphologies." You et al. (2005) coded the specimen for Chiappe's
  matrix and found it to be a euornithine outside Ornithurae. You et al.
  (2006) describe several additional far more
  complete specimens of this genus, which they place as an ornithurine
  sister to Carinatae. Ji et al. (2006) later described one
  of the new specimens (CAGS-IG-04-CM-008) in detail, noting it preserves
  webbed feet. Bailleul et al. (2019) figured mandibles in their
  supplementary information as an unpublished specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>,
  but these were later described by O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022)

  <b>Hauterivian-Barremian, Early Cretaceous<br>
    Andaikhudag (= Anda Khooduk) Formation, Mongolia</b><br>
  <b>Holotype</b>- (PIN 3790-271/272) (~270 mm) seven cervical vertebrae,
  three or four anterior dorsal vertebrae, dorsal rib fragments,
  incomplete scapula, incomplete coracoid, incomplete sternum, partial
  furcula, proximal humerus (~67 mm), incomplete radius, incomplete ulna,
  proximal carpal, incomplete carpometacarpus, phalanx II-1, phalanx
  II-2, manual ungual II, body feathers, remiges<br>
  <b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kurochkin, 2000) transverse ligamental fossa
  proximal to bicipital crest.<br>
  (after O'Connor and Zelenkov, 2013) posterolateral sternal process
  wide; posterolateral sternal process curved medially; ventral edge of
  proximal end of humerus strongly developed and with distinct tubercle
  on its cranial surface; transverse groove short, fossa-like, and runs
  dorsoventrally; pneumotricipital fossa of humerus not developed;
  deltopectoral crest projected dorsally; bicipital crest distally ends
  abruptly.<br>
  <b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (2000) included several additional
  characters in his diagnosis. Most basal euornithines (e.g. <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Apsaravis</i>, basal Aves) share dorsoventrally compressed acromia.
  The acromia of <i>Patagopteryx</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i> are equally
  long, while that of <i>Apsaravis</i> is even longer. The scapular
  blades of most basal euornithines except <i>Patagopteryx</i> are
  equally slender. The longitudinal groove in the posterolateral scapular
  blade is also present in most basal euornithines (e.g. <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i>). The
  procoracoid process is equally long and broad in <i>Hongshanornis</i> and songlingornithids. The absent capital groove is shared with <i>Apsaravis</i>.
  Several other basal euornithines have a fossa instead of a transverse
  ligamental groove, but that of <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> differ in being on the bicipital crest, not proximal to it. The
  proximal fusion of the carpometacarpus is symplesiomorphic for
  avialans, while the dorsoventrally compressed manual phalanx II-1 is
  seen in euornithines except <i>Patagopteryx</i>.<br>
  O'Connor and Zelenkov (2013) proposed other characters. The hooked
  acromion is shared with <i>Apsaravis</i>. The procoracoid process is
  similarly angled in e.g. songlingornithids. <br>
  <b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1977 and described by
  Kurochkin (1982) as a carinate (which was equivalent to Ornithurae then
  as the few known fragments of taxa intermediate between <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and hesperornithines were not recognized as such). Cracraft (1986) was
  the first to include it in a phylogenetic analysis, which placed <i>Ambiortus</i> in an unresolved trichotomy with <i>Ichthyornis</i> and Aves (his
  Neognathae), though enantiornithines were also placed in this position
  because no other avialans were known and hesperornithines were placed
  too basally based on their flightlessness. Sanz and Buscalioni (1992)
  found <i>Ambiortus</i> to have an uncertain position compared to
  Ornithurae and Enantiornithes in their cladogram.<br>
  <b><i>Ambiortus</i> a palaeognath?</b> Kurochkin referred it to
  Palaeognathae in 1985 based on several characters. The long pointed
  acromion is also found in songlingornithids and anatoids. The
  supposedly wide and short acrocoracohumeral ligament scar is equally
  long in other basal euornithines (e.g. <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i>), and mediolaterally narrower as in <i>Gansus</i>.
  The longitudinal groove on the ventral acrocoracoid face is homologized
  to a pit in palaeognaths, but a similar depressed area is present in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>. In his 1995 paper, Kurochkin added a few
  supposed palaeognath characters. The bicipital crest was said to be
  absent, but is the "slightly pronounced cranial tubercle" he described
  in 1999. The deltopectoral crest begins just as proximally in other
  basal euornithines. The glenoid facet on the coracoid is displaced
  dorsally in <i>Apsaravis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> as well. The
  short and wide acrocoracoid is symplesiomorphic for euornithines. The
  hypocleidium is also absent in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Yanornis</i>, <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>. In 1999, Kurochkin added yet
  more supposed palaeognath characters in his description. The
  dorsoventrally flattened acromion is symplesiomorphic for euornithines
  (e.g. <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Apsaravis</i>, Galliformes). A dorsal
  tubercle on the acromion is also present in <i>Iaceornis</i> and <i>Anas</i>.
  The well developed ventral tuber is also present in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Alamitornis</i>. The "remarkable cranial
  tubercle" with an anterior pit is the bicipital crest, which also has
  such a pit in enantiornithines and <i>Apsaravis</i>. The strongly
  laterally projecting, posteriorly placed "caudal transverse processes"
  seem to be laterally flared postzygapophyseal processes instead, as
  seen in <i>Ichthyornis</i>. <br>
  Hope (2002) states several characters (capital groove; pneumotricipital
  fossa; ventral tuber; bicipital crest) are poorly developed in <i>Ambiortus</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i>, palaeognaths and galliforms compared to most
  neognaths and enantiornithines. She attributes this either to
  convergence in the latter groups or placement of <i>Ambiortus</i> in
  Palaeognathae. Yet the first three characters are well developed in <i>Lithornis</i> and tinamiforms, while the bicipital crest is extremely reduced in
  neognaths in addition to tinamiforms. Given the distribution of
  characters in recently discovered basal euornithines, <i>Ambiortus</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i> lost their capital grooves independently of
  ratites, pneumotricipital fossae developed convergently in some
  enantiornithines and Aves, ventral tuber size is quite homoplasic, and
  a low bicipital crest is primitive for euornithines.<br>
  In conclusion, nearly all of the proposed palaeognath characters in <i>Ambiortus</i> are symplesiomorphic, with the exception of the dorsal acromion
  tubercle.<br>
  <b><i>Ambiortus</i> an ichthyornithine?</b> Martin (1987) believed <i>Ambiortus</i> was the sister taxon to <i>Apatornis</i> (based on the <i>Iaceornis</i> holotype) within Ichthyornithiformes because of their long acromia, but
  those of <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Patagopteryx</i> are also elongate, as are most enantiornithes'.<br>
  Chatterjee (1999) found <i>Ambiortus</i> to clade with
  Ichthyornithiformes in his analysis. This was based on the supposedly
  amphicoelous cervicals (actually heterocoelous in <i>Ambiortus</i>-
  Kurochkin, 1999) and absent bicipital crest (actually present in both <i>Ambiortus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>).<br>
  <b><i>Ambiortus</i> a basal euornithine?</b> Sereno and Rao (1992)
  found <i>Ambiortus</i> to be a euornithine outside of Ornithurae based
  on an unpublished phylogenetic analysis, but this cannot be evaluated.<br>
  Elzanowski (1995) placed <i>Ambiortus</i> in basal Euornithes (his
  Neornithes), excluded from Aves (his Neognathae) due to the dorsally
  projecting deltopectoral crest and lack of an extensor process on
  metacarpal I, and excluded from Carinatae (unnamed node in his
  cladogram, not equivalent to his Carinatae) based on the more laterally
  facing scapular glenoid and prominent acromion process. The
  deltopectoral crest is anteriorly projecting in patagopterygids, but
  otherwise seems to be an unambiguous avian character. As described and
  illustrated by Kurochkin (1999), <i>Ambiortus</i> actually has an
  extensor process, albeit a low one. Small acromia are also present in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i> but absent in the very derived <i>Iaceornis</i>,
  so show some homoplasy. The glenoid does seem less dorsally angled than
  carinates.<br>
  Chiappe (2001) placed <i>Ambiortus</i> closer to Aves than <i>Patagopteryx</i> based on the procoracoid process (also absent in <i>Apsaravis</i>) and
  proximally globe-shaped humeral head. It was excluded from Carinatae
  due to the absent extensor process (again miscoded, as it is actually
  present but low) and the presence of manual ungual II (miscoded as
  absent in <i>Ichthyornis</i> based on an <i>Iaceornis</i> element,
  but still valid to exclude <i>Ambiortus</i> from an <i>Iaceornis</i>+Aves
  clade). While placed between Hesperornithes and <i>Ichthyornis</i> on
  his cladogram, Chiappe later (2002) noted it could equally
  parsimoniously be placed as sister to Ornithurae.<br>
  Clarke (2002) first included <i>Ambiortus</i> in her unpublished
  thesis' matrix, finding it positioned above <i>Patagopteryx</i>, but
  in a polytomy with <i>Apsaravis</i>, <i>Gansus</i>, <i>Hesperornithes</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i>, <i>Limenavis</i> and <i>Iaceornis</i>+Aves. It
  was first published in a version of Clarke's matrix by You et al.
  (2006), which presents <i>Ambiortus</i> as falling out more derived
  that <i>Patagopteryx</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i>, but more basal
  than <i>Apsaravis</i>, songlingornithids, <i>Gansus</i> and
  ornithurines. The supplementary information indicates it also emerged
  as a songlingornithid in some trees. In the first position, <i>Ambiortus</i> was more derived than <i>Patagopteryx</i> and <i>Hongshanornis</i> based on the absent hypocleideum, proximally domed humeral head,
  extensor process on metacarpal I, and highly compressed manual phalanx
  II-1. It was less derived than Aves based on several characters-
  acrocoracoid process not hooked medially; pit on bicipital crest absent
  (miscoded in <i>Ambiortus</i>); extensor process on metacarpal I not
  projecting; thick metacarpal III (which cannot actually be coded, as
  only the fused base is preserved); phalanx II-2 longer than II-1
  (miscoded in <i>Ambiortus</i>).<br>
  While several characters were miscoded by various authors, <i>Ambiortus</i> does seem excluded from Aves based on- scapular glenoid less dorsally
  angled; acrocoracoid not medially hooked; dorsally projecting
  deltopectoral crest; low extensor process on metacarpal I; manual
  ungual II present.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang et al., 2015a) anterior of mandible
straight; teeth only present in maxilla and dentary.<br>
(after O'Connor et al., 2016; for <i>Dingavis</i>) rostrum forms
63-65% of skull length; jugal process of lacrimal posterolaterally
excavated; length of carpometacarpus + major digit exceeds humeral
length by 25% (118-126% in <i>Dingavis</i>' type, ~135% in <i>Juehuaornis</i>'
type, 118-~121% in <i>Changzuiornis</i>' type); short metacarpal I
(13.7% of metacarpal II) (12-14% in <i>Dingavis</i>' type, ~14% in <i>Juehuaornis</i>'
type, 16-18% in <i>Changzuiornis</i>' type); tarsometatarsus with
small but sharp medial and lateral plantar crests, plantar surface of
metatarsus not excavated; metatarsal II much shorter than metatarsal
IV; metatarsal II and IV trochlea plantarly displaced; metatarsal II
trochlea strongly angled craniomedially. <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Wang et al. (2015a) listed a longer snout
length (~70%) as diagnostic of <i>Juehuaornis</i>. They claim the
premaxilla is hooked, but this isn't apparent from the photo. The <i>Dingavis</i>
holotype has a disarticulated predentary which resembles a
frigatebird-style hook at first glance, so this provides a possible
explanation for the <i>Juehuaornis</i> holotype. Wang et al. also list
forelimb and hindlimb similar in length as diagnostic, which is 104% in
<i>Juehuaornis</i> and a similar 96-101% in <i>Dingavis'</i> type.
However, <i>Changzuiornis</i>' type has a longer forelimb (111-112%).<br>
O'Connor et al. (2016) claimed <i>Dingavis</i> lacks teeth, but the
material is very poorly preserved, so that small teeth may not be
visible (as in the <i>Hongshanornis</i> type). <br>
Huang et al. (2016) distinguished <i>Changzuiornis</i> and <i>Juehuaornis</i>
from <i>Dingavis</i> by their longer skulls (221% and 190% of femoral
length vs. 162%), but these form a gradation that matches specimen
size. Similarly, they distinguished <i>Changzuiornis</i> by its longer
scapula (158% of femoral length vs. 123% in <i>Juehuaornis</i> and
101-107% in <i>Dingavis</i>), but this also matches specimen size. One
difference noted by Huang et al. that doesn't match specimen size is
the ratio between manual phalanges II-1 and II-2, which is 109-112% in <i>Changzuiornis</i>,
but 79% in <i>Juehuaornis</i> and 94-100% in <i>Dingavis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- While O'Connor et al. (2016) assigned <i>Dingavis</i>
to the Yixian Formation, it was found in Sihedang, which is here viewed
as belonging to the Jiufotang Formation (see <i>Iteravis</i> entry).
Chen (DML 2016) proposed <i>Dingavis</i> is a junior synonym of <i>Juehuaornis</i>.
As he noted, they have very similar proportions and each has the
others' diagnostic characters when known, with the exceptions of the
supposed hooked bill of <i>Juehuaornis</i>, and toothlessness of <i>Dingavis</i>
as described above under 'Other diagnoses'. The only other significant
difference observed by Chen is that <i>Dingavis</i> supposedly lacks
manual phalanx III-2, but as he says, this is very small in <i>Juehuaornis</i>
and so easily lost in the poorly preserved <i>Dingavis</i> holotype.
Wang et al. (2015b) first noted another Jiufotang longirostrine
euornithine which was formally described by Huang et al. (2016) as <i>Changzuiornis</i>.
Huang et al. considered the possibility their new taxon was synonymous
with the other Sihedang longirostrine birds, stating "while if new data
shows that <i>Xinghaiornis</i>, <i>Juehuaornis</i> and <i>Dingavis</i>
form a clade that constitutes the same genus, the genus name <i>Juehuaornis</i>
would have priority for <i>Dingavis longimaxilla</i> and <i>Changzuiornis
ahgmi</i>." The few differences listed are all proportional, and it's
notable almost all proportional differences between the three holotypes
covary with size, with the generally intermediate-sized <i>Juehuaornis</i>
the usual intermediary proportion-wise too. This suggests the
possibility of a growth series, which is provisionally accepted here.<br>
The holotype of <i>Juehuaornis</i> was briefly described in Chinese
and only illustrated as low resolution photos of part and counterpart.
It has yet to be included in a phylogenetic analysis, but was
classified by Wang et al. (2015a) as an ornuthuromorph. O'Connor et al.
recovered <i>Dingavis</i> as more derived than <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>
but less than hongshanornithids and songlingornithids plus avians using
O'Connor's matrix. Huang et al. (2016) recovered <i>Changzuiornis</i>
as more derived than hongshanornithids and songlingornithids, but less
than <i>Iteravis</i>, <i>Gansus</i> and taxa closer to Aves, using a
version of Clarke's matrix. <br>

<strong>Diagnosis</strong>- (after Wang et al., 2025) combination of- acuminate premaxilla; edentulous premaxilla; premaxilla longer than preantorbital ramus of maxilla; procumbent maxillary teeth; maxillary teeth restricted to anterior end of bone; maxillary teeth much larger than underlying dentary teeth; nasal with large subnarial process;  laterodistal end of coracoid does not define a distinct process, describing an acuminate 45 degree corner; large U-shaped furcula; furcula contacts the sternum; triangular anterior end of sternum; humerus with elongate and gently curved deltopectoral crest; humerus with robust shaft (about five times its mid-shaft diameter); manual phalangeal formula 2-3-2; gracile manual digit I less than half radius shaft width; manual phakanx III-1 more than four times longer than III-2.<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>- Wang et al.

Wang et al.

<b>Comments</b>- O'Connor et al. (2009) propose Hongshanornithidae to
include <i>Hongshanornis</i> and the at-the-time undescribed <i>Longicrusavis</i>.
This is based on- dorsal dentary convex and dorsal surangular concave
(also in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, many enantiornithines and probably <i>Patagopteryx</i>);
posterolateral sternal processes not expanded much distally (probably
symplesiomorphic as it is found in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Gansus</i>
and basal enantiornithines); manus longer than humerus (probably
symplesiomorphic as it is found in non-ornithothoracines, <i>Protopteryx</i>,
<i>Pengornis</i> and <i>Longipteryx</i>); forelimb/hindlimb ratio
(humerus+ulna / femur+tibia) &lt;90% (also in <i>Patagopteryx</i> and
hesperornithines). O'Connor et al. (2010) later described <i>Longicrusavis</i>
and used the same matrix, also adding the manual formula of 2-3-2 to
the diagnosis for Hongshanornithidae. Yet this is plesiomorphic, also
being found in basal enantiornithines. Notably, <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>
was not included in their matrix, <i>Patagopteryx</i> was coded as
lacking the mandibular character even though the surangular is dorsally
concave and the dentary missing, no enantiornithines with the
mandibular character were included, <i>Shanweiniao</i> and <i>Longipteryx</i>
were miscoded as having greatly expanded posterolateral sternal
processes, and basal enantiornithines that have long manus and sternal
processes with small expansions were not included.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zheng et al., 2014) toothed upper and lower
jaws; premaxillary and maxillary teeth much larger than dentary teeth;
anterior half of dentary straight; uncinate processes elongate,
crossing two adjacent ribs; coracoid length/width ratio ~1.6; U-shaped

<b>Comments</b>- Zheng et al. (2014) refer this new taxon to
Hongshanornithidae without a phylogenetic analysis, but as I argue
here, that family is mostly based on symplesiomorphies. <i>Tianyuornis</i>
even lacks the supposed hongshanornithid character of posterolateral
sternal processes not expanded much distally. Also note <i>Hongshanornis</i>
has recently been shown to have both upper and lower teeth, so at least
this character is not diagnostic of <i>Tianyuornis</i>. However, Wang
et al. (2015) added it to O'Connor's bird analysis and found it to fall
within Hongshanornithidae as the sister of <i>Archaeornithura</i>. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Li et al., 2011) coracoid elongate
(length/distal width 2.3) (also in <i>Hongshanornis</i>); furcula
anteroposteriorly compressed proximally (also in <i>Yanornis</i>);
deep groove along clavicular symphysis (also in <i>Yanornis</i>);
fibula close to half tibiotarsal length (also in <i>Longicrusavis</i>).
<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Li et al. (2011) listed other characters in the
diagnosis as well. A U-shaped furcula, elongate sternum, xiphoid
sternal processes, short posteromedial sternal processes (which create
two pairs of posterior excavations), distally expanded posterolateral
sternal processes, anteriorly extensive sternal keel, subequally long
metacarpals II and III, straight and slender manual phalanx II-2,
opisthopubic pelvis and a pubic boot are primitive for euornithines.
The forelimb is also short in <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Hongshanornis</i>
and <i>Longicrusavis</i>. Manual phalanx II-1 is also short in <i>Yanornis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i>. The tibiotarsofemoral ratio is also high in <i>Hongshanornis</i>,
<i>Longicrusavis</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>. The
tibiotarsus is also slender in <i>Hongshanornis</i>, <i>Longicrusavis</i>,
<i>Yixianornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>. The tarsometatarsus is shorter
in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Jianchangornis</i>, <i>Patagopteryx</i>,
<i>Longicrusavis</i>, <i>Yanornis</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Li et al. (2011) referred this taxon to
Hongshanornithidae based on the U-shaped elongated furcula and short
forelimb. The former is also true in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>, <i>Yanornis</i>
and <i>Jianchangornis</i>. The latter is also true in <i>Patagopteryx</i>.
Wang et al. (2015) added it to O'Connor's bird analysis and found it to
clade in Hongshanornithidae as sister to other members except <i>Hongshanornis</i>.<br>
O'Connor
et al. (2005) mention a new euornithine (as an ornithuromorph) in an
SVP abstract, distinct
from most in having a tibiotarsus longer than the humerus. 
While the authorship is the same as <span style="font-style: italic;">Longicrusavis</span>
from JVP five years
later, the locality of near Chaoyang in the Jiufotang Formation matches
<span style="font-style: italic;">Parahongshanornis</span> instead (<span style="font-style: italic;">Longicrusavis</span> was found near
Lingyuan in the
Yixian Formation).  The reported forelimb/hindlimb ratio is also
slightly closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Parahongshanornis</span>
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Longicrusavis</span>
(79% versus 80% and 77%), but whether this is the holotype that was

gastroliths (O'Connor et al., 2010)<br>
(STM coll.) over 24 specimens (Zheng et al., 2011)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (from Zhou and Zhang, 2005) dentary ventrally curved
(also in <i>Archaeorhynchus</i>); posterolateral sternal processes
angled medially; hypocleidium present; forelimb/hindlimb (humerus+ulna
/ femur+tibiotarsus) ratio 83-85%.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zhou and Zhang (2005) included additional
characters in their diagnosis. A premaxilla with a slender and pointed
anterior end is also present in <i>Archaeorhynchus, Longicrusavis</i>,
songlingornithids and hesperornithines. Though they state both the
premaxilla and maxilla are toothless, O'Connor et al. (2010) note
alveoli are present in both. Similarly, contra Zhou and Zhang, Chiappe
et al. (2014) find teeth in the dentary. A sternum with two pairs of
posterior excavations is primitive for ornithothoracines. Chiappe et
al. note the supposed tapering posterolateral process on the holotype's
sternum is too poorly preserved to verify, and DNHM D2945/6 has either
an expanded process or a fenestra. STM 35-3 shows expanded ends. A
U-shaped furcula and laterally expanded manual phalanx II-1 are
primitive for euornithines. Manual phalanx II-2 is also sinuously
curved in <i>Longicrusavis, Yixianornis</i> and <i>Gansus</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note Wang et al. (2014) incorrectly call DNHM D2945/6
the paratype, but it is not as it was not mentioned in the original
description.<br>
<b>Miscoded originally?</b> You et al. (2006) changed numerous codings
for <i>Hongshanornis</i> based on personal observation from Chiappe
and O'Connor. These include making the following states uncertain-
dentary teeth absent (untrue- Chiappe et al., 2014); amount of upper
beak formed by premaxilla (yet the suture seems clear and DNHM D2945/6
also has a short ventral margin); length of dorsal premaxilla process
(yet the tip of the process is clearly seen); length of dorsal maxilla
process; anterior extent of splenial; amphicoely of cervical centra;
length/width ratio of dorsal centra (DNHM D2945/6 shows they were
elongate); presence of uncinate processes (present in DNHM D2945/6);
number of free caudal vertebrae (yet the pygostyle's position indicates
it must be small); epicleidial morphology (hidden by matrix- Nesbitt et
al., 2009); presence of procoracoid process; presence of lateral
coracoid process (it seems absent in the photo of the holotype, but is
definitely present in DNHM D2945/6); length of acromion process (long
in DNHM D2945/6); depth of sternal keel; orientation of deltopectoral
crest (yet it seems obviously dorsally projected in the photo and in
DNHM D2945/6); prominence of bicipital crest; development of semilunate
dorsal condyle on ulna (present in DNHM D2945/6); presence of pisiform;
fusion of carpometacarpus (completely fused in DNHM D2945/6); convexity
of medial edge of metacarpal I (it seems convex in the photo, but is
definitely concave in DNHM D2945/6); ginglymoidy of metacarpal I (seems
flat in DNHM D2945/6); dorsal contact of ilia (at least unfused to
sacral neural spines in DNHM D2945/6); orientation of postacetabular
process; pubic orientation (the pubis is in anterior view, though
O'Connor et al. state they are retroverted; definitely retroverted in
DNHM D2945/6); cross sectional shape of pubis (transversely compressed
in DNHM D2945/6); presence of ilioischiadic fenestra; presence of
proximodorsal ischial process (though O'Connor et al. state one is
absent); presence of obturator flange; tibiotarsal fusion
(astragalocalcaneum fused to tibia but with visible suture posteriorly
in DNHM D2945/6); comparative width of tibiotarsal condyles (lateral
largest in DNHM D2945/6); tarsometatarsal fusion (yet it seems present
in the photo and is complete in DNHM D2945/6); absence of metatarsal V
(yet the holotype and DNHM D2945/6 are complete enough to make its
absence probably not taphonomic); ginglymoidy of metatarsal II (present
in DNHM D2945/6). Additionally, they added several codings- dentary
symphysis dorsally concave; dorsal centra with deep lateral fossae (as
in DNHM D2945/6); gastralia present (as noted by Zhou and Zhang);
lateral coracoid margin not convex (as in DNHM D2945/6; Chiappe et al.
suggest the holotype is too poorly preserved to code); scapula subequal
or longer than humerus (shorter in DNHM D2945/6); intermetacarpal
process absent or present as a scar (process present in DNHM D2945/6);
pubic boot absent (as noted by Zhou and Zhang, though DNHM D2945/6 has
a pubic boot). Unfortunately, the photo of the specimen is small and
often makes independant confirmation of states impossible. <br>

<b>Barremian-Aptian, Early Cretaceous<br>

Holotype</b>- (PM TSU 16/5-45) tarsometatarsus (26.4 mm; II 21.4, III
26.1, IV 25.8 mm) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kurochkin et al., 2011) central proximal
articular facet on tarsometatarsus; canal in lateral extensor sulcus
opening in distal vascular foramen; metarsal II does not reach distal
vascular foramen.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin et al. (2011) listed numerous
characters in their diagnosis of Mystiornithiformes, but among them,
coplanar metatarsals and an absent proximodorsal fossa are primitive
for theropods; dorsally ridged metatarsals are also present in
avisaurids; distally fused metatarsals are also present in <i>Avisaurus
gloriae</i> and <i>Vorona</i>.<br>
Kurochkin et al also listed many supposedly diagnostic characters of
Mystiornithidae and <i>Mystiornis</i>. Of these, metatarsal II is
often the shortest of II-IV in theropods; trochlea often have acutely
angled sagittal planes; dorsally concave metatarsal shafts, an
anteriorly angled proximal surface of metatarsal II, extremely
dorsoventrally flattened trochlea II and a ventrally flat metatarsal
III are also present in avisaurids; the proximal surface of metatarsal
II is not positioned more distally than those of III and IV, nor is the
ventral surface of metatarsal III projected noticably compared to
metatarsal II. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2000 and announced by
Kurochkin et al. (2009). The description was first posted online in
December 2010 before being officially published in March 2011. While
Kurochkin et al. placed the taxon in its own order and family, it is
not as distinctive as their paper would suggest. They included it in a
version of O'Connor et al.'s (2009) matrix, which resulted in an basal
avialan clade of <i>Mystiornis</i>, <i>Avisaurus</i>, <i>Vorona</i>
and <i>Mei</i>. The other newly added taxon, <i>Anchiornis</i>, is in
a polytomy with the aforementioned clade and avebrevicaudans. This
suggests a systematic coding error by the authors for their added taxa,
which I have not yet confirmed via examination. When <i>Mystiornis</i>,
<i>Avisaurus</i> and <i>Vorona</i> are coded for that matrix, the
latter two fall out in their normal positions (derived enantiornithine
and basal euornithine), while <i>Mystiornis</i> is an ornithothoracine
outside of Longipterygidae and <i>Hongshanornis</i>+Aves. Indeed,
Cau's (2011, online) unpublished analysis places <i>Mystiornis</i> as
an avisaurid enantiornithine. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Wang et al.
(2016a) included other characters in their diagnosis.  The furcula
only
appears V-shaped due to the hypocleidium, but has medially curved arms.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The genus <i>Bellulia</i> is preoccupied by a
micronoctuid moth (Fibiger, 2008), so the bird was renamed <i>Bellulornis</i>
by Wang et al. (2016b). The latter name was first used in an IVPP press
release, so was an nomen nudum for a time. Wang et al. (2016a) added
the taxon to O'Connor's bird matrix and found it to be a euornithine
sensu Sereno more derived than only <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> and <i>Jianchangornis</i>,
in a clade with <i>Schizooura</i>. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Wang et al., 2013) long and slim rostrum;
toothless beak; dentary with elongated grooves; slender, Y-shaped

<b>Comments</b>- Wang et al. (2013) believe this taxon may be close to
the base of Ornithothoraces based on the combination of classic
enantiornithine (long hypocleidium; metacarpal III extends distal to

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Norell and Clarke, 2001) dentary forked

strong tubercle on the proximal posterior surface of the humerus
directly distal to the humeral head; distal humerus strongly flared and
anteroposteriorly compressed (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>); humeral
distal condyles strap-like (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>); dorsal
condyle of humerus transversely oriented (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>);
ventral condyle of humerus strongly projected distally (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>);
enlarged lateral ridge on the femur (unknown in Ambiortus; also in
hesperornithines); medial tibiotarsal condyle &lt;60% the width of the
lateral condyle (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>; also in Longicrusavis);
tibiotarsal condyles do not slope towards center in distal view
(unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>; also in <i>Longicrusavis</i>);
tibiotarsal intercondylar groove less than 30% as wide as distal
condyles (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>); well-projected wings of the
sulcus cartilaginis tibialis on the posterodistal tibiotarsus.<br>
(after Clarke and Norell, 2002) laterally hooked acromion process (also
in <i>Yanornis</i>); metatarsal II non-ginglymoid (unknown in <i>Ambiortus</i>;
also in some hesperornithines and <i>Yanornis</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Norell and Clarke (2001) also use the scapular
blade which does not expand at midlength in their diagnosis, though
Clarke and Norell (2002) later exclude it from their diagnosis and
analysis, citing difficulty in defining it objectively. In any case,
such a scapula is also present in songlingornithids and <i>Hesperornis</i>,
making its presence in <i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Ambiortus</i>
equally likely to be convergent as it is to be developed basally in
Euornithes and lost by <i>Apsaravis</i>. Norell and Clarke note a
supposedly apomorphic hypertrophied trochanteric crest on the femur,
which is also described and photographed by Clarke and Norell. However,
this structure is a posterolaterally projected crest distal to the
femoral head, which is unlike trochanteric crests but like the lateral
ridge of more basal maniraptorans which is derived from the
trochanteric shelf. Whether the lateral ridge's size is apomorphic is
uncertain, as hesperornithines have an even larger bulge and <i>Patagopteryx</i>
and <i>Gansus</i> have small tubercles. Another less developed
vertical ridge is present posterior to this, which could also be
homologized to the trochanteric shelf. However, topologically, this
would be equivalent to the posterior trochanter. <br>
Clarke and Norell (2002) also add a fused dentary symphysis to their
diagnosis, but that is optimized as a carinate character here. <br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was discovered in 1998 and described briefly in 2001 by
Norell and Clarke, then in detail the next year (Clarke and Norell,
2002). It was originally placed as the sister taxon to Carinatae, but
Clarke (2002) and Clarke and Norell (2002) found it to be the sister
group of Ornithurae instead. This result has been found in further
permutations of Clarke's matrix as well (e.g. You et al., 2006;
O'Connor et al., 2009).<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b><i>Palintropus</i></b>
Brodkorb, 1970<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Longrich, 2009) acrocoracoid process massive
and knob-like (also in <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>); edge of
humeral articular facet with a prominent lip in ventral view (also in <i>Yixianornis</i>);
prominent scar inside supracoracoid sulcus (unknown in most non-avian
euornithines).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1892) first noted the absent procoracoid
process as diagnostic, but this is shared with <i>Apsaravis</i>.<br>
Here I interpret the very large, centrally and distally placed
supracoracoid foramen noted as diagnostic by Hope (2002) as the
proximal edge of a dorsal coracoid fossa as in <i>Apsaravis</i>. This
same feature was described as "prominent dorsal groove in coracoid
shaft" by Longrich (2009).<br>
Longrich also included the supracoracoid foramen opening into a medial
groove of the coracoid shaft, which is shared with <i>Apsaravis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1892) originally included <i>retusus</i> in <i>Cimolopteryx</i>,
as <i>C. retusa</i>. Shufeldt (1915) noted it was not referrable to <i>Cimolopteryx</i>
and probably not even closely related, though he felt it was too
fragmentary for further evaluation. Brodkorb (1963) first removed it to
<i>Apatornis</i>, which he viewed as an ichthyornithine. He then (1970)
placed it in a new genus <i>Palintropus</i>, which he believed was a
cimolopterygid charadriiform. <br>
<b><i>Palintropus</i> a galliform?</b> Hope (2002) questionably
referred this taxon to Galliformes. This was based on the reduced
procoracoid process, coracoid facet for scapula placed entirely distal
to glenoid. Several other characters were listed in Hope's Galliformes
diagnosis as being reasons why she placed "specimens below" (consisting
solely of <i>Palintropus</i>) in that order, but are eithjer
undescribed (coracoid neck with stout and triangular cross section) or
unknown (elongate coracoid shaft; narrow sternal end of coracoid;
rudimentary lateral process) in that genus. She also noted the
acrocoracoid was similar in size to galliforms (larger than
tinamiforms, smaller than anseriforms and most neoavians), the absence
of a pneumatic foramen is unlike tinamiforms, and the laterally
positioned coracoid tubercle which merges with the glenoid is similar
to galliforms. However, the procoracoid process is also absent in <i>Patagopteryx</i>
and (as noted by Longrich, 2009) <i>Apsaravis</i>, while it is still
present though reduced in basal galliforms like <i>Paraortygoides</i>,
<i>Paraortyx</i> and <i>Ameripodius</i>. I also note <i>Apsaravis</i>
has a coracoid facet placed distal to the glenoid. Lack of coracoid
pneumatization is present in all non-avians (except perhaps <i>Jixiangornis</i>
and <i>Jianchangornis</i>). The laterally positioned coracoid tubercle
that merges with the glenoid is also found in galliforms, tinamiforms, <i>Lithornis</i>,
<i>Patagopteryx</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i>, <i>Jianchangornis</i>, <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Ambiortus</i>, so seems symplesiomorphic for Aves. <i>Gansus</i>
and <i>Ichthyornis</i> also have moderate sized acrocoracoid
processes. <br>
Hope referred it questionably to the basal galliform family
Quercymegapodiidae based on the large free lateral flange on the
coracoid glenoid, further reduced procoracoid process (only with <i>Quercymegapodius</i>
and not <i>Ameripodius</i>), and scar within the supracoracoid sulcus
(only verified in <i>Ameripodius</i>). Also she correctly noticed the
deep cup-like scapular facet is unlike crown galliforms. <i>Apsaravis</i>,
<i>Ichthyornis</i>, <i>Gansus</i>, <i>Yixianornis</i>, <i>Patagopteryx</i>
and <i>Archaeorhynchus</i> also have a large lateral flange on the
coracoid glenoid. Almost all non-avian euornithines also have scapular
cotyla which are deeper than those of crown galliforms. The texture of
the supracoracoid sulcus is generally indeterminable in non-avian
euornithines, even when they expose the sulcus as in <i>Yixianornis</i>.
Hope, Mayr (2009) and Longrich all noted that it was unlike Tertiary
Galliformes in having a supracoracoid foramen, and Longrich stated it
differed further in lacking a strongly hooked acrocoracoid.<br>
Thus <i>Palintropus</i> does not share any characters with galliforms
not seen in <i>Apsaravis</i> except for the larger acrocoracoid (which
is also seen in some non-avian euornithines). As <i>Palintropus</i>
has some characters which exclude it from Galliformes, and the only
character shared with a quercymegapodiid (the supracoracoid sulcus
scar) is indeterminate in <i>Apsaravis</i> and most other non-avian
euornithines, it is near certainly not a member of Quercymegapodiidae.<br>
<b><i>Palintropus</i> related to <i>Apsaravis</i>?</b> Longrich (2009)
suggested <i>Palintropus</i> was related to <i>Apsaravis</i> based on
the absent procoracoid process and medial supracoracoid groove. They
also seem to share a deep dorsal fossa in the coracoid. While these
characters are also shared with most enantiornithines, the
scapulocoracoid articulation is unlike that clade. The referred dorsal
and femur also lack enantiornithine synapomorphies (e.g. they have
anteriorly placed parapophyses and no posterior trochanter). Longrich
et al. (2011) included <i>Palintropus</i> in a version of Clarke's
matrix where it claded with <i>Apsaravis</i>, but did not include
basal galliforms that could test Hope's hypothesis.<br>

(after Buffetaut and Angst, 2019) synsacrum and ilium extensively

<b>Comments</b>-
Buffetaut et al. (1995) described a synsacral fragment of a large bird,
which they left unnamed. Buffetaut and Le Loeuff (1998) later described
the holotype partial pelvis and paratype femur from different
localities as the new taxon <i>Gargantuavis philoinos</i>.
They referred the femur because of its similar size and large
trochanteric crest which could articulate with the holotype's
antitrochanter, but this must be regarded as provisional. While they
state the previously described synsacral fragment MDE-A07 is similar to
the middle of MDE-CE-525, they do not refer it explicitly to the taxon.
Buffetaut (2011a, b) first noted a referred completely heterocoelous
cervical vertebra, which was described by Buffetaut and Angst (2013). A
new femur MC-MN 1335 was described by Angst et al. (2019), which along
with the cervical and sacral and ilial fragments (Buffetaut and Angst,
2016b) "come from the same sedimentary layer and were found a short
distance from each other and may belong to a single individual." 
This
femur is smaller and at first glance very different in shape from the
paratype, but Angst et al. argue to paratype is extremely crushed and
badly reconstructed.  They stated that if the two are different
taxa,
MC-MN 1335 was more likely to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>as
it was found in the same locality as other specimens.  Buffetaut
et al. (2019) describe a new femur Mechin coll. 711 from the same beds
as three other synsacra which resembles MC-MN 1335, further supporting
the referral of this morphotype to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>. 
Mayr et al.
(2020) describe a new partial pelvis found in 2003 in Romania as "Gen.
et sp. indet. (cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx nopcsai</span>
Andrews, 1913)" although they also call it <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span> multiple times in the
paper.  They state it is "only about 80% the size of the <span style="font-style: italic;">G. philoinos</span>
holotype, from which it furthermore
differs in a more caudally positioned acetabulum, which is situated on
the level of the fifth synsacral vertebra, whereas it is on the level
of the fourth vertebra in <span style="font-style: italic;">G.
philoinos</span>"
and thus "certainly represents a different species."  While this
may be
true, Mesozoic theropod species show large varience in size and only
the holotype and Bastide-Neuve pelvises can be shown to have anteriorly
placed acetabula.  If further discoveries show correlated
characteristics in certain localities, it may prove more useful to
separate <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
species.  <br>
Buffetaut and Le Loeuff (1998) placed <i>Gargantuavis</i> as a
non-ornithurine euornithine, closer to <i>Patagopteryx</i>
based on the broad pelvis but closer to ornithurines in sacral number.
Despite the large number of basal euornithines described in the last
two decades, Buffetaut's qualitative opinion has remained vague with
Buffetaut and Angst (2019) stating only "<span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis philoinos</span>
is certainly an ornithuromorph, and in all likelihood a basal
ornithurine" while assigning it a monotypic family.  Mayr (2009;
based
on Worthy, pers. comm.) suggested <i>Gargantuavis</i> was pterosaurian
based on the anteriorly placed acetabulum and contemporaneous large
azhdarchids, but Buffetaut and Le Loeuff (2011) demonstrated pterosaur
femora are highly dissimilar and that that clade generally has
posteriorly placed acetabula.  Mayr et al. (2020) subsequently
agreed
"azhdarchid affinities of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
are not well founded."  Most recently, Mayr et al. (2020)
suggested <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
was excluded from Ornithurae based on the unfused pelvis
(iliopubic and ilioischial articulations in UBB V649) and from
Pygostylia based on middle sacral vertebrae without transverse
expansion.  While sacral expansion has yet to be incorporated into
phylogenetic analyses, a lack of pelvic fusion also seems to be present
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Enaliornis</span> (BGS 87431).
Mayr et al. noted that the proximal femur <span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx</span> "was of a similar
size to UBB V649, and we consider it well possible that the new pelvis
belongs to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx</span>", but
the latter taxon was recovered as a
non-ornithothoracine avialan by Hartman et al. (2019) and certainly
differs from both supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
femora.  They further argued
the basal avialan <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span> was
similar in a few features (ventrally
arched sacrum, broad pelvis, large antitrochanter) although smaller
with a fused pelvis.  This led them to propose the hypothesis that
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
belong to a distinctive theropod clade, which was characteristic for
the Late Cretaceous European archipelago or parts thereof."  <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
has only been entered into a single published phylogenetic analysis,
that of Hartman et al. (2019) which recovered it as a
non-hesperornithoid hesperornithine (a clade which included <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>).  This is
unchanged after entering in the new data from MC-MN 1335 and UBB V649.
Forcing it to be sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span>
takes 11 more steps, while forcing it to be sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>
only takes 1 more step.  Restricting the OTU to sacral and ilial
characters retains its position as a basal hesperornithine, and forcing
it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span> takes 6
more steps while forcing it to be sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx</span> takes 3 steps but the
latter moves to Hesperornithes instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
being more basal.  Forcing all three genera to form an exclusive
clade is 8 steps longer, with the phylogenetic position of <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span> winning out. 
Considering this data, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gargantuavis</span>
is here considered to be an euornithine not particularly close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span>,
with the cervical and femora probably correctly referred considering
their phylogenetic characters and stratigraphical proximity at
Montplo-Nord.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Elopteryx</span>
is more parsimoniously the femur of <span style="font-style: italic;">Balaur</span>
(1 step longer).<br>

<p>Zhyraornithi Nessov, 1992<br>
Zhyraornithidae Nesov, 1984<br>
<i><b>Zhyraornis </b></i>Nesov, 1984<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Nesov, 1984) sacral centra four
through eight extremely narrow ventrally (&lt;30% of dorsal sacral
width); well developed lateral fossa in second sacral centrum.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of Nesov's (1984) other characters in his
diagnosis- amphicoelous centra are symplesiomorphic for theropods; the
sacrum's narrowness is similar to other basal carinates; the neural
spine crest is continuous in most birds and is not tall in <i>Z.
logunovi</i>; and the first sacral centrum has lateral fossae in <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Guildavis</i> as well. Nessov's other characters are based on
the questionably referred paratype dorsal (lateral central fossae in
dorsal vertebrae) and scapula (curved and projected acromion).<br>
Kurochkin (2000) included several additional characters in his
diagnosis for the genus, but none are valid. <i>Apatornis</i> and many
other Mesozoic birds have ventrally concave synsacra. The anterior
articular surface is not particularily broad in <i>Z. logunovi</i> at
least (width ~107% of height), comparable to the subcircular surfaces
described for <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Guildavis</i>. The slight
anterior broadening is comparable to other basal carinates, as is the
absence of a ventral groove. <i>Ichthyornis</i> can also only have one
sacral with small transverse processes in front of those with large
processes (in the holotype, but not YPM 1372). Finally, the largest
transverse processes (on sacrals two and three) are also posteriorly
directed in <i>Ichthyornis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nesov (1984) first referred <i>Zhyraornis</i> to its
own family within Ichthyornithiformes (in which he included <i>Apatornis</i>),
due to the amphicoelous anterior articular surface and pleurocoels in
the first two centra. While the latter seems to be based on incorrect
homology with YPM 1372, Nesov was correct in his general idea. In 1992,
he erected the suborder Zhyraornithi within Ichthyornithiformes,
presumably to separate <i>Zhyraornis</i> further from <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Apatornis</i>. Kurochkin (1995) suggested it was an
enantiornithine, based on several characters and similarity to <i>Gobipteryx</i>
(= <i>Nanantius valifanovi</i> of Kurochkin). Of the characters he
lists, "flatness and general shape" are vague, but <i>Zhyraornis</i>
has highly convex centra ventrally and the general sacral shape is
almost identical to <i>Apatornis</i>. Contra Kurochkin, a ventral
groove is absent in <i>Zhyraornis</i>, and pleurocoels are present
anteriorly in <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Guildavis</i>. In 1996, he
elaborated his view, referring <i>Zhyraornis</i> to the Alexornithidae
within Enantiornithes, again based on comparison to <i>Gobipteryx</i>.
He referred it to Enantiornithes based on three characters. "General
shortness" cannot be evaluated due to the missing posterior ends, but
the taper of the sacrum and proportions of each vertebrae match <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Apatornis</i> closely. The most anterior portion is said to
have small, equisized transverse processes ventrally, but transverse
processes two and three are much larger than the others, as in <i>Apatornis</i>
and somewhat less in <i>Ichthyornis</i> (in the latter the third is
largest, while the second is similar to the fourth). The wide neural
canal is shared with all birds and most small maniraptoriforms. He
referred it to Alexornithidae based on three characters. Dorsal
curvature is also present in <i>Apatornis</i> and many other birds.
Contra Kurochkin, the transverse processes are not equisized, being
much larger in sacrals two and three, as noted above. Finally, he
states only two or three costal processes are enlarged on the anterior
synsacrum, but this is true in <i>Apatornis</i>, and is not
necessarily true in <i>Gobipteryx</i>, as the anterior one or two
sacrals are missing their lateral processes. Kurochkin later (2006)
placed <i>Zhyraornis</i> in Euornithes (his Ornithurae) based on
unstated characters. In both his phylogram and cladogram, it is placed
between Confuciusornithidae (which Kurochkin viewed as basal
euornithines unrelated to dinosaurs, while enantiornithines were
theropods) and Carinatae. His cladogram specifies a placement more
derived than <i>Liaoningornis</i>, yet they share no known elements,
so the result would be impossible in an actual phylogenetic analysis.
His phylogram indicates indicates he believed it branched around <i>Patagopteryx</i>,
<i>Kuszholia</i> and <i>Gargantuavis</i>. O'Connor (2009) correctly
criticized Kurochkin's (1995) characters and felt "a placement in
Ornithuromorpha may be more fitting", noting that both <i>Zhyraornis</i>
synsacra differed from enantiornithines. Yet she also declared the
genus a nomen dubium without demonstrating its published diagnostic
characters are present in any other taxon. Based on the diagnosis
above, the taxon is valid. <br>
Both species of <i>Zhyraornis</i> are similar in general morphology.
The large lateral fossae on centra one and two are likely continuations
of such fossae in the dorsal vertebrae, as seen in most Cretaceous
avialans. <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>'s sacrum includes at least seven
vertebrae, indicating they belong to Avialae or perhaps
Caenagnathoidea. Yet caenagnathoids with seven sacrals differ in having
all sacral vertebrae pleurocoelous, except <i>Avimimus</i> which has
apneumatic centra and a ventral median groove. <i>Sapeornis</i>'
sacrum is dissimilar in that the posterior transverse processes are
most robust and the anterior three are directed anteriorly. <i>Confuciusornis</i>
differs in having broader centra with a ventral groove and robust
posterior transverse processes, though the anterior centra are similar
in having pleurocoels. Most enantiornithines differ in having much
broader centra with ventral grooves where known, and robust posterior
transverse processes. The Lecho Formation enantiornithine PVL-4041-4 is
roughly similar, although the first centrum is narrower and the fifth
and sixth are broader. Also, the second and third transverse processes
angle anteriorly instead of posteriorly, while those of the fourth,
sixth and seventh vertebrae are more prominent. <i>Gansus</i>' is much
broader after sacral two, with transverse processes two and three
directed perpendicular or anteriorly and those of five and six more
prominent. It seems to be similar in having fossae on sacral centra one
and two though. Hesperornithines and neornithines differ in having a
heterocoelous anterior articulation, while hesperornithines also differ
in being non-pneumatic. <i>Ichthyornis</i>' sacrum is extremely
similar in centrum width, transverse process size and direction, though
the third transverse process is broader ventrally and the fourth better
developed. Importantly, they share a series of midsacral reduced
transverse processes, which is a carinate sensu lato character. It is
also similar in having pleurocoels on the first centrum, though
seemingly not on the second. A complication is YPM 1372, which fused an
extra dorsal to its sacrum, giving it two sacrals with pleurocoels. Yet
the transverse process morphology in <i>Zhyraornis</i> suggests its
first sacral is homologous to the second sacral in YPM 1372 and the
first sacral in the <i>Ichthyornis</i> holotype. In <i>Z. logunovi</i>
at least, the second transverse process is as robust as the third,
unlike <i>Ichthyornis</i>. One major difference between <i>Zhyraornis</i>
and <i>Ichthyornis</i> is that the centra of the former narrow
drastically after the third centrum. <i>Apatornis</i>' is similar in
being narrow and having a series of midsacrals with reduced transverse
processes. The transverse process size and orientation are similar
where known. Yet it differs from <i>Zhyraornis</i> in lacking a
pleurocoel on sacral two (sacral one is not preserved), and apparently
having less narrow centra ventrally, especially in the posterior centra
(Nesov, 1984). <i>Guildavis</i> is similar in having narrow anterior
centra without a ventral groove, and a pleurocoel on the first centrum.
There may a be a pleurocoel in the second sacral as well, but if so it
is smaller than <i>Zhyraornis</i>. Poor preservation presents further
comparison. Which of these last three taxa <i>Zhyraornis</i> is more
closely related to is unknown, as the total number of vertebrae, number
of vertebrae with reduced transverse processes, and presence of
parapophyses on the first vertebra are unknown. It is here assigned to
Carinatae sensu Chiappe incertae sedis.<br>

<i><b><a name="Zhyraorniskashkarovi"></a>Z. kashkarovi</b></i> Nesov,
1984<br>
<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
</b><b>Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan<br>
Holotype</b>- (TsNIGRI 42/11915) (~225 mm) anterior synsacrum (27 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b> (after Nesov, 1984) neural spine crest on synsacrum
tall.<br>
(after Nessov, 1992) sacrum more concave ventrally than <i>Z. logunovi</i>
or <i>Apatornis</i>; transverse processes in second and third sacrals
with little projection in dorsal view; transverse processes of second
and third sacrals extremely thin in ventral view.<br>
(after Kurochkin, 2000) sacral centra four to eight &lt;20% of dorsal
width of sacrum.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (2000) listed a couple additional
characters in his diagnosis. The slight anterior expansion of the first
sacral centrum is indistinguishable from <i>Guildavis</i>. He notes
the largest transverse processes (on sacrals two and three) are
posteriorly angled (~55-60 degrees), but <i>Ichthyornis</i> shows this
can be quite variable (~55-71 degrees in YPM 1372 and perhaps 86
degrees in the holotype), so this cannot be used to diagnose species.
The sacrum does not appear more "extended" than in other basal
carinates.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Zhyraornis kashkarovi</i> was first used in Nessov
and Borkin (1983) as a figure caption for the dorsal vertebra TsNIGRI
43/11915, which was later made a paratype of the species. As no
description accompanied the name, it was a nomen nudum. It may belong
to <i>Zhyraornis</i>, as it seems to be an ornithothoracine but not an
enantiornithine, hesperornithine or avian. It is given its own entry
here, however. Nesov made additional specimens paratypes of <i>Z.
kashkarovi</i> as well. The proximal scapula TsNIGRI 44/11915 is here
referred to Euornithes incertae sedis, while the humeral shaft TsNIGRI
45/11915 is referred to Maniraptora indet.. Isolated shafts of long
bones (TsNIGRI 48/11915, 49/11915 and 50/11915) which were not
described or illustrated are similarly referred to Maniraptora indet.. <br>
The tall neural spine is the only one of Nesov's (1984) original
diagnostic characters for <i>Z. kashkarovi</i> that is still valid at
the species level. The others are dealt with under the genus entry.
Nessov (1992) in his diagnosis of the new species <i>Z. logunovi</i>
noted numerous differences, a few of which are apomorphic and are noted
above.<br>

<b>Mid-Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
</b><b>Bissekty Formation, Uzbekistan</b> <br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 4600) (~200 mm) anterior synsacrum (~24 mm) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Nessov, 1992b) wider anterior articular
surface than <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>; pleurocoel in first sacral vertebra
larger than <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of Nessov's (1992b) other listed diagnostic
characters, the narrow sacrum with prominent ventral ridge is also
present in <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>. The second sacral transverse process
angles to be perpendicular to the sacrum long axis distally, which is
indeed unlike <i>Z. kashkarovi</i> (unless it is broken in the
latter), but is similar to <i>Ichthyornis</i>. The third sacral's
transverse processes angle posteriorly ~69-78 degrees, which is less
than <i>Z. kashkarovi</i> (~55-60 degrees), but <i>Ichthyornis</i>
shows this can be quite variable (~55-71 degrees in YPM 1372 and
perhaps 86 degrees in the holotype), so this cannot be used to diagnose
species. The low amount of ventral concavity seem to be primitive, as <i>Apatornis</i>
is similar. The more ventrally placed second vertebra's pleurocoel may
be diagnostic, but the pneumatic features are known to exhibit a high
degree of variation between individuals and even between sides of the
vertebra. The well developed anterior transverse processes (in dorsal
view) and wide ventral struts supporting them are plesiomorphically
similar to <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Apatornis</i>, though indeed
dissimilar to <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>. Nessov stated the upper ridge
behind the contact of the second and third sacrals was wider and better
developed than in <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>, but I don't see a difference.
Most of the spinal nerve foramina are said to be more anteroposteriorly
compressed, but this is not apparent in the poor photocopy available
and has unknown variation. <br>
Kurochkin (2000) listed two additional characters in his diagnosis. The
abrupt anterior expansion of the first sacral centrum is similar to <i>Ichthyornis</i>.
The sacrum is not "generally expanded and broadened" for a carinate,
only in comparison to the derived condition in <i>Z. kashkarovi</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1989 and mentioned as
a new species of <i>Zhyraornis</i> (though unnamed) by Mourer-Chauvire
(1989) and Nessov (1992a). Kurochkin (1996) considered <i>Z. logunovi</i>
to probably belong to a separate genus than <i>Z. kashkarovi</i> based
on the characters described by Nessov, but they seem more similar to
each other than to other Mesozoic birds, with the narrow posterior
centra and lateral fossae on sacral centrum two being derived
characters not present in <i>Ichthyornis</i> or <i>Apatornis</i>. In
contrast, O'Connor (2009) stated the holotypes "are not readily
distinguishable; the differences suggested by the diagnosis provided by
Kurochkin (2003) [actually 2000] cannot be confirmed from published
figures." I disagree and find the characters cited in my diagnoses from
Nessov's and Kurochkin's works to be readily visible in their figures.<br>

Khodzhakul Formation, Uzbekistan</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 3390) (~285 mm) proximal tarsometatarsus<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Horezmavis</i>
was described as Aves (sensu lato) incertae sedis by Nessov and Borkin
(1983), though Nessov later (1992) assigned it to Gruiformes based on
resemblences to Ralli. Kurochkin (1995) considered it a gruiform based
on several characters, but Hope (2002) found these to have a broader
distribution within euornithines. The lateral position of the m.
tibialis cranialis tubercle is shared with most euornithines; the
intercotylar prominence is not as well developed as Aves; the presence
of two proximal vascular foramina is present in carinates sensu
Chiappe; a hypotarsus is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagopteryx</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span> and taxa as close to
Aves as <span style="font-style: italic;">Changmaornis</span>; and an
elongate shaft is also found in such taxa as <i>Gansus</i>, <i>Hollanda</i>,
basal hesperornithines and <i>Apsaravis</i>. Kurochkin (2000) later
stated its position within Gruiformes was less certain, but did feel it
was a neognath. The characters he cites are also present in more basal
euornithines however. A completely fused tarsometatarsus is present in
all euornithines while a infracotylar fossa is present in
songlingornithids and more derived birds. Martin (1995) considered it
an enantiornithine, but this is surely incorrect based on the distal
metatarsal fusion, proximal metatarsal III which is displaced
ventrally, intercotylar priminence, hypotarsus, presence of two
proximal vascular foramina, centrally placed m. cranialis tibialis
tubercle, and unreduced metatarsal IV. The character evidence thus
suggests it is at least as derived as <i>Ichthyornis</i>, but further
resolution depends on more detailed comparisons to basal Aves.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- amphicoelous cervicals; acromion that does not
extend anteriorly past the coracoid condyle; internal index process
on manual phalanx II-1 (absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>
KUVP 2284- ontogenetic?).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1873a, b) originally diagnosed
Ichthyornidae, Ichthyornithes and Odontornithes based on their
amphicoelous vertebrae (only the posterior dorsals were definitely
amphicoelous in <i>Apatornis</i>, based on its sacrum), which are
plesiomorphic.<br>
Marsh diagnosed Ichthyornithes (1875a) then Odontormae (1875b) by their
plesiomorphic presence of teeth placed in sockets (as in most
archosaurs), a keeled sternum (as in most ornithothoracines) and
"developed wings" (as in most birds).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1873a) named Ichthyornidae to include <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Apatornis</i>, which Furbringer (1888) emended to its proper
form Ichthyornithidae. Marsh later (1873b) placed ichthyornithids in
the new order Ichthyornithes, but in the 1875b publication, replaced
Ichthyornithes with Odontotormae because he thought the previous name
was preoccupied. As Clarke (2004) noted though, Marsh never mentioned
which taxon supposedly preoccupied Ichthyornithes, and recent searches
for homonyms have been unsuccessful. Furbringer created
Ichthyornithiformes for a more inclusive group than Ichthyornithes
(though with the same known contents), which became the name generally
used until Clarke phylogenetically defined Ichthyornithes in her <i>Ichthyornis</i>
monograph. Clarke (2002) incorrectly claimed Furbringer never named the
taxon and that it was only mistakenly attributed to him by Brodkorb.
Most recently Ichthyornithes was made official by Benito et al.
(2022).  <br>
Wetmore (1962) named the Plegadornithidae for his new genus <i>Plegadornis</i>,
which he placed in the Ciconiiformes close to threskiornithids. Kashin
(1972) noted <i>Plegadornis</i> was preoccupied, so renamed it <i>Angelinornis</i>
and suggested the family be named Angelinornithidae. <i>Angelinornis</i>
was synonymized with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>
by Olson (1975), making Angelinornithidae a junior synonym of
Ichthyornithidae. It should be noted Plegadornithidae should only be
used for a family containing <i>Plegadornis</i> however. <br>
<b>Ex-ichthyornithines</b>- Marsh (1873a) included <i>Apatornis</i> in
Ichthyornithidae and later Ichthyornithes and Odontotormae, which has
been followed by most authors (based largely on <i>Iaceornis</i>
material after 1880) until Clarke (2004) found a lack of supportive
characters. Nesov (1984) assigned his new taxon <i>Zhyraornis</i> to
Ichthyornithiformes, which may be correct but has not been supported
with any valid characters yet. Nessov (1986) described a partial
synsacrum as <i>Ichthyornis maltshevskyi</i>, but this was placed in
the new genus <i>Lenesornis</i> by Kurochkin (1996) and seems to be a
more basal ornithothoracine, perhaps an enantiornithine. Martin (1987)
assigned <i>Ambiortus</i> to the Ichthyornithiformes, but this has not
been supported by phylogenetic analyses. Nessov (1990) described a
dorsal vertebra as <i>Ichthyornis minusculus</i>,
but this seems to be an enantiornithine (Kurochkin, 1996). Several
specimens from the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan were assigned to
Ichthyornithiformes by Nessov (1992a, b), but are here placed as
Ornithothoraces incertae sedis (partial dentary ZIN PO 4608, and tooth
ZIN PO 4610) or Euornithes incertae sedis (proximal coracoid ZIN
PO 4605, and dorsal vertebra ZIN PO 4607).  Bell and Everhart
(2011) described coracoid FHSM VP-17459 as Ichthyornithes indet., but
the character they based this on ("prominent, medially projecting
acrocoracoid process") is also present in many avians such as
'cimolopterygids'.<br>

<i><b><a name="Ichthyornisanceps"></a>Ichthyornis</b></i> Marsh, 1872b<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (the clade stemming from an ancestor that possessed
amphicoelous cervical centra, an acromion that does not extend
anteriorly past the coracoid condyle, a dorsal ulnar condyle where the
posterior extent of the articular surface is equal to the width of the
articular surface across its distal end, an oval scar on the
posteroventral surface of the distal radius in the center of the
ligamentous depression, and a large tubercle developed on the
laterodistal surface of metacarpal II, homologous with those in <i>Ichthyornis
dispar</i>; <i>Ichthyornis dispar</i> &lt;- <i>Struthio camelus,
Tinamus major, Vultur gryphus</i>) (Clarke, 2004)<br>

<b>Not <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span></b>- A
number of other species have been referred to <i>Ichthyornis</i> in
the past. Marsh (1873a) described <i>Ichthyornis celer</i>, but later
referred it to its own genus <i>Apatornis</i> in 1873b. Marsh (1880)
referred <i>Graculavus lentus</i> to <i>Ichthyornis</i> to form the
new taxon <i>Ichthyornis lentus</i>, but this was placed in the new
galliform genus <i>Austinornis</i> by Clarke (2002, 2004). <i>Ichthyornis
tener</i> was named by Marsh (1880) and assigned to the new genus <i>Guildavis</i>
by Clarke. Martin and Stewart (1982) described a dorsal vertebra from
the Vermillion River Formation of Manitoba as <i>Ichthyornis sp.</i>,
but Clarke identified it as an enantiornithine. Zinsmeister (1985)
reported tentative <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>
material from the Lopez de Bertodano Formation of Antarctica, but
Chatterjee (pers. comm. 12-6-2020) stated "It was misidentified in the
field. These were some shark teeth."  They are assigned to
Odontaspidae here (Mortimer, online 2020).  Nessov (1986)
described a partial synsacrum as <i>Ichthyornis maltshevskyi</i>, but
this was placed in the new genus <i>Lenesornis</i> by Kurochkin (1996)
and seems to be a more basal ornithothoracine, perhaps an
enantiornithine. Nessov (1990) described a dorsal vertebra as <i>Ichthyornis
minusculus</i>, but this seems to be an enantiornithine (Kurochkin,
1996). <br>

(also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tianyuornis</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>) dorsal ulnar condyle where the
posterior extent of the articular surface is equal to the width of the
articular surface across its distal end (unknown in other non-avian
euornithines except <i>Apsaravis</i>); oval scar on the posteroventral
surface of the distal radius in the center of the ligamentous
depression; large tubercle developed on the laterodistal surface of
metacarpal II.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1872a) originally diagnosed <i>Graculavus
anceps</i> as being larger than <i>G. velox</i> (which was not
otherwise comparable, being based on a humerus; contra Clarke, 2004),
and differing from the phalacrocoracid <i>"Graculus violaceus"</i>
(now <i>Phalacrocorax pelagicus</i>) in several characters. These
were- broader and flat articular surface for phalanx II-1; smaller and
oval articular surface for phalanx III-1; larger distal tubercle
between these surfaces. Obviously comparisons to cormorants are of
little use, as <i>Ichthyornis</i> is not even a crown clade bird.<br>
Marsh (1872b) suggested amphicoelous cervicals were diagnostic, but
this is also present in NHMM/RD 271.<br>
Marsh (1872c) distinguished <i>Colonosaurus mudgei</i> from mosasaurs
in its lack of a conspicuous Meckelian groove, but this is common in
derived birds.<br>
Marsh (1873b) distinguished <i>Graculavus agilis</i> from <i>G. anceps</i>
based on its smaller size, gracility and reduced carpal fossa. As
Clarke (2004) noted, the first two differences do not seem to exist,
while the third is unknown in the <i>anceps</i> holotype, since that
only preserves the distal carpometacarpus.<br>
Marsh (1876) distinguished <i>Ichthyornis victor</i> from <i>I. dispar</i>
based on its larger size, but Clarke (2004) determined that there was a
continuous variation in size of <i>Ichthyornis</i> specimens from the
Smoky Hills Chalk and that no morphological differences between small
and large specimens were apparent besides a few forelimb scars being
more prominent on larger ones.<br>
Marsh (1880) distinguished <i>I. anceps</i> from <i>I. dispar</i>
based on a more slender mandible with more teeth, based on a referred
specimen (YPM 1749) that cannot be compared to the <i>anceps</i>
holotype. While Clarke (2004) thought it might be "slightly more
delicate" than YPM 1450, she noted it contained the same number of
teeth. Marsh distinguished <i>I. victor</i> from <i>I. dispar</i>
based on the stouter and deeper mandible of YPM 1735, though Clarke
notes its proportions cannot be determined as it is incomplete.<br>
Harrison (1973) listed two humeral characters as diagnostic of <i>Ichthyornis</i>-
dorsally projecting deltopectoral crest and small bicipital crest, but
Clarke (2004) found these both to be plesiomorphic for birds.<br>
Olson (1975) distinguished <i>I. antecessor</i> from supposed <i>I.
dispar</i> specimen YPM 1764 based on several characters- more gracile
humeral shaft; shallower and more distally positioned brachial fossa;
ectepicondylar process more prominent; pit at base of ectepicondylar
process shallower. Clarke (2004) noted the <i>I. dispar</i> holotype
is slender as in the <i>I. antecessor</i> holotype and that the other
differences were minor and vary in Smoky Hill <i>Ichthyornis</i>
specimens.<br>
Clarke (2004) suggested several diagnostic characters, at least two of
which are now known in NHMM/RD 271- acromion that does not extend
anteriorly past the coracoid condyle; internal index process on manual
phalanx II-1.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- While multiple species of Smoky Hill Chalk <i>Ichthyornis</i>
were recognized early on, the lack of proper diagnoses made referral of
remains to the species level uncertain through the 1900's. Elzanowski
(1995), Clarke (1999, 2000), Clarke and Chiappe (2001) and Chiappe
(2002) all noted the taxonomic mess and only provisionally referred
elements not preserved in the holotype (or specimens which shared
elements with the holotype) to the taxon, fearing multiple species were
represented. Clarke (2002) examined all the specimens at the YPM for
her thesis, removing some from <i>Ichthyornis</i> and synonymizing the
others into one species, which she called <i>Ichthyornis dispar</i>.
This study was published in 2004 in a slightly modified version that
mostly differed in lacking several taxa in its phylogenetic analysis.
Her taxonomy has been followed in the recent literature.<br>
The holotype of <i>Ichthyornis anceps</i> (the distal carpometacarpus
YPM 1208) was discovered in 1870 and described by Marsh (1872a) as <i>Graculavus
anceps</i>. Marsh assigned it to <i>Graculavus</i> because he thought
it resembled phalacrocoraciids, which he placed <i>Graculavus velox</i>
near as well. Marsh (1880) later placed <i>anceps</i> in <i>Ichthyornis</i>
without comment, also referring the mandible and partial humerus YPM
1749 to the species (though they are not comparable to the type).
Shufeldt (1915) believed <i>anceps</i> was too fragmentary and
distorted to diagnose or place precisely within Aves. However, Clarke
(2004) noted it has <i>Ichthyornis</i>' apomorphic distal metacarpal
tubercle and does not differ from the <i>I. dispar</i> holotype except
in size. Clarke misinterpreted the ICZN in respect to <i>Ichthyornis
anceps</i> vs. <i>I. dispar</i> when she sank the former into the
latter though. Although <i>I. anceps</i> cannot be the type species of
<i>Ichthyornis</i>, it can be a senior synonym of of <i>I. dispar</i>.
Furthermore, according to the 1999 edition of the ICZN, <i>I. anceps</i>
is not a nomen oblitum, as it was used as a valid species by Stewart
(1990). While previously this website used <span style="font-style: italic;">I. anceps</span> as a senior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">I. dispar</span>,
the recent recognition of Belgian NHMM/RD 271 as a distinct species of
ichthyornithine complicates matters as it does not preserve a
carpometacarpus.  Thus <span style="font-style: italic;">anceps</span>
cannot be distinguished from it and should not be the holotype of Smoky
Hill ichthyornithines.  Similar issues arise for <span style="font-style: italic;">agilis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">validus</span>,
as NHMM/RD 271 also lacks a preserved ulna, but further consideration
is delayed pending redescription and naming of the Belgian taxon.<br>
Marsh (1872b) briefly described <i>Ichthyornis dispar</i> as a partial
bird postcranium and a week later (1872c) described <i>Colonosaurus
mudgei</i> as reptilian mandibles similar to mosasaurs. However, these
are based on the remains of one individual, as Marsh later (1873a)
realized. Marsh described <i>Ichthyornis dispar</i> in more detail in
1873a, 1875a, 1875b and especially 1880. In the latter publication,
Marsh also referred YPM 1718, 1723 and 1730 to <i>I. dispar</i>
preseumbly based on size. Gregory (1952) believed the mandibular
elements (including <i>Colonosaurus</i>) belonged to juvenile
individuals of the mosasaur <i>Clidastes</i>, which was followed by
several later authors. Gingerich (1972) described a posterior mandible
as <i>Ichthyornis cf. dispar</i>, and agreed with Marsh, Russell
(1967) and Walker (1967) that the toothed mandibles did belong to <i>Ichthyornis</i>.
Olson (1975) referred YPM 1764 provisionally to <i>I. dispar</i>,
pending a revision of <i>Ichthyornis</i> by Brodkorb which never
appeared. Paris and Echols (1992) described a humerus and partial
forelimb from the Ector Chalk Formation of Texas as <i>I. dispar</i>,
though they are currently catalogued as <i>I. victor</i> in the TMM
collections. <br>
Marsh (1873b) named <i>Graculavus agilis</i> based on a proximal
carpometacarpus (YPM 1209) found in 1872. The description was extremely
brief and no type material was mentioned, though Marsh referred both <i>Graculalvus
anceps</i> and <i>G. agilis</i> to the Natatores. Marsh (1880) later
placed <i>agilis</i> in <i>Ichthyornis</i> without comment and
referred the ulna YPM 1453 to the species (though it is not comparable
to the type). Shufeldt (1915) believed the holotype was indeterminate
and impossible to place precisely within Aves. Clarke (2004) found <i>agilis</i>
was identical to other Smoky Hill <i>Ichthyornis</i> specimens, so
synonymized it with <i>I. dispar</i>. <br>
<i>Ichthyornis victor</i> was discovered in 1876 and described that
year by Marsh as a new larger species of <i>Ichthyornis</i>. This was
based on YPM 1452, which consists of three partial forelimb elements.
Marsh (1880) described and referred numerous specimens to <i>I. victor</i>-
YPM 1447, 1456, 1457, 1458, 1461, 1463, 1464, 1724, 1726, 1727, 1732,
1733, 1735, 1739, 1741, 1742, 1743, 1745 and 1775. While a partial
coracoid was originally associated with YPM 1459, Clarke (2004) noted
it articulates perfectly with a partial coracoid from YPM 1458, so was
moved to that specimen. Hope (2002) illustrates these specimens as <i>Ichthyornis
sp.</i>, with the old coracoid number. Chinsamy et al. (1998) described
the histology of KUVP 2294, a specimen they referred to <i>I. victor</i>.
Clarke (1999) considered <i>I. victor</i> a chimera, because the
mounted skeleton which was incorrectly labeled as the holotype actually
contained elements from several <i>Ichthyornis</i> specimens (YPM
1447, 1453, 1461, 1724, 1728, 1732, 1733, 1739, 1741) as well as what
would become the holotype of <i>Iaceornis</i> (which was previously
noticed by Howard, 1955 and Elzanowski, 1995). Clarke (2004) noted YPM
1732 differs from the <i>I. dispar</i> holotype in having twelve
sacral vertebrae, though the <i>victor</i> holotype is identical to <i>dispar</i>
except in size. If the species really are distinct and diagnosed
partially by size, <i>I. anceps</i> would be the valid name for the
large species (with <i>agilis</i>, <i>victor</i> and <i>validus</i>
as synonyms) while <i>I. dispar</i> would be the valid name for the
small species.<br>
<i>Ichthyornis validus</i> based on an ulna (YPM 1740) discovered in
1877 and not diagnosed by Marsh when he named it in 1880. Brodkorb
(1967) claimed a radius was also known for YPM 1740, but this seems to
be untrue. The partial coracoid YPM 1446 was referred to <i>validus</i>
by Marsh (1880) without comment. Clarke (2004) noted it was more robust
and larger than most other YPM specimens, the supracoracoid foramen did
not lie in a groove, and that there is a unique groove extending from
the supracoracoid foramen in the triossial canal. The holotype is the
only subadult YPM specimen of <i>Ichthyornis</i> known, and is larger
than some adult specimens such as the <i>dispar</i> holotype. Clarke
synonymized it with <i>I. dispar</i> since it is morphologically
identical.<br>
Wetmore (1962) described a distal humerus (USNM 22820) as <i>Plegadornis
antecessor</i>, which he thought was a ciconiiform close to
threskiornithids. Kashin (1972) noted that <i>Plegadornis</i> was
preoccupied by a genus named by Brehm in 1855, which in turn is a
junior synonym of the threskiornithid genus <i>Plegadis</i>. Thus he
renamed the genus <i>Angelinornis</i>. Olson (1975) synonymized <i>Angelinornis</i>
with <i>Ichthyornis</i> but retained <i>Ichthyornis antecessor</i> as
a valid species. Paris and Echols (1992) described a distal humerus
(TMM 42522-1) from the Pflugerville Formation of Texas and proximal
carpometacarpus (ET 4396) from the Gober Formation of Texas and
referred them to <i>Ichthyornis antecessor</i>. The humerus was
referred because it was thought to live at a later time than Smoky Hill
<i>Ichthyornis</i> and compare better morphologically to the <i>antecessor</i>
holotype, but the former is not necessarily true while Clarke notes it
is equally similar to the <i>I. dispar</i> holotype. It is currently
catalogued as <i>I. sp.</i> in the TMM collections. The
carpometacarpus was only tentatively referred based on stratigraphy and
supposed differences from Smoky Hill <i>Ichthyornis</i> material, but
Clarke could not confirm these differences. As noted above, Clarke
determined the supposedly distinct characters of <i>antecessor</i>
fell within the range of individual variation for Smoky Hill Chalk <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
so synonymized this species with <i>I. dispar</i>.<br>
Martin and Stewart (1977) described the jaws of a skeleton found in
1970, which was found in 1970 and referred to <i>Ichthyornis sp.</i>.
While they referred to this specimen as SMM 13520, though it is
actually 2503. Clarke (2004) referred this specimen to <i>I. dispar</i>.<br>
Lucas and Sullivan (1982) described a humerus (YPM 9148) from the
Mancos Shale in New Mexico found in 1979 as <i>Ichthyornis sp.</i>,
but Clarke (2004) referred it to <i>I. dispar</i>.<br>
KUVP 119673 was found in 1992 and was announced by Burnham and Hines
(2005), but its fragmentary skull was described in detail by Fields et
al. (2018).  FHSM VP-18702 was found on August 17 2014 and its
nearly complete skull was described by Field et al..  The latter
study also redescribed and refigured all known <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span> cranial elements, but
the postcrania of the new specimens remain undescribed.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Cumbaa and Tokaryk (1993) mentioned two
ichthyornithids from the Ashville Formation of Saskatchewan, which were
later described by Tokaryk et al. (1997) as <i>Ichthyornis</i> species
A (RSM P2077.11, P2077.67, P2077.112 and P2487.5), <i>Ichthyornis</i>
species B (RSM P2077.111) and <i>I.</i> sp. indet. (RSM P2077.71).
They referred the specimens to <i>Ichthyornis</i> based on the
coracoid scapular facet being nearly parallel to the sternal end of the
glenoid facet, which Clarke (2004) noted was found in <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
but not apomorphic. Longrich (2009) suggested the Ashville coracoids
did not resemble <i>Ichthyornis</i>, and were referrable to <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
based on their dimorphism (<i>P. hardiei</i> vs. <i>P? tankei</i>),
pachyostosis, and supposed lack of coracoids in the <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
material. Sanchez (2010) confirms the coracoids are <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>.  The identity of
RSM P2077.71 is unresolved.<br>
Cumbaa et al. (2006) mention <i>Ichthyornis</i>-like bones from the
Bainbridge River bed of the same member, which Sanchez specifies are
two humeri and a questionably referred vertebra.<br>

central fossae; fenestrated ventrolateral tubercles on fourth dorsal
vertebra; pneumatic dorsal ribs; complete absence of an acromion
process on scapula; much larger size than <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>.<br>
compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>-
medial side of the humeral head is flat instead of protruding
proximally; ventral tubercle is more ovoid and dorsoventrally oriented;
shorter deltopectoral crest (31 vs 37-42% of humeral length); dorsal
and ventral rami which surround pneumotricipital fossa are be more
distinct (taphonomic?); craniocaudally narrower manual
phalanx II-1.<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
Discovered in 2000, Dyke et al. (2002) described this specimen as
Ornithurae indet. based on the globular humeral head, and assigned it
to
Carinatae based on the prominent brachial fossa.  Clarke (2004)
considered it Avialae incertae sedis because free proximal tarsals are
generally absent in adult euornithines, but the supposed tarsal was
misidentified.  Dumont et al. (2016) found it was "positively
identifiable as either belonging to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>
sp., or to a closely related taxon within the Ichthyornithiformes"
based on studies of the
tooth.<br>
Benito et al. (2020, 2022) CT scanned the specimen and recognized five
cervical vertebrae, five more dorsal vertebrae, manual phalanx II-1,
the rest of the scapula, proximal femur and a pedal phalanx in addition
to what Dyke et al. reported.  Benito et al (2022) report "the
reported lower jaws, partial jugals and a possible quadrate all
correspond to a portion of the thorax comprising two thoracic vertebrae
and six associated ribs", the supposed proximal coracoid was
reidentified as a pterygoid, "The reported partial right ulna instead
corresponds to the caudal end of the right scapular blade", the
proximal tarsal "most probably corresponds to a partial pedal phalanx"
and "A reported tarsometatarsus also appears to be absent." 
The authors added NHMM/RD 271 to Clarke's and O'Connor's bird matrices
and recovered it as an ichthyornithine.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1875a, b) diagnosed his new taxon
Odontolcae based on several characters. Teeth set in grooves are found
in <i>Hesperornis</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i> and  <i>Pasquiaornis,</i>
but are unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Enaliornis</span>. 
All presacral vertebrae being heterocoeliys is not true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>.  The keelless
sternum is present in <i>Hesperornis</i> and probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Fumicollis</span> but still unknown for
more basal genera, while the reduced forelimb is present at least as
early as <i>Pasquiaornis</i>, but unknown in <i>Enaliornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1875a) named Odontolcae as an order including <i>Hesperornis</i>
but not <i>Ichthyornis</i>. Martyniuk (2012) gave it an
apomorphy-based definition, which could apply to all hesperornithines
or only taxa as derived as <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>
given the lack of information for <span style="font-style: italic;">Enaliornis</span>.
Stejneger (1885) modified it to be the subclass Odontoholcae, and named
the order Dromaeopappi. <br>
Romer (1933) placed <i>Eupterornis</i> from the Paleocene of France in
Baptornithidae, but is was reassigned to Gaviiformes by Brodkorb
(1963). Brodkorb (1963) placed <i>Neogaeornis</i>
in in Baptornithidae, but it was placed in Gaviiformes by Olson (1992)
and has more recently been assigned to Vegaviidae by Agnolin et al.
(2017). Nessov (1992) had identified KKM KP 4925/P131 as the incomplete
humerus of a hesperornithine, but later (in Mourer-Chauvire, 1992)
determined it was a mosasaur limb element. Longrich (2006) stated the
dorsal vertebra TMP 1989.081.0012 from the Dinosaur Park Formation of
Alberta was a possible hesperornithine, but later (2009) referred it to
<i>Palintropus</i> sp.. Dyke et al. (2011) referred a supposed distal
femur (MTCO 17637) from the Cornet bauxite of Romania to Hesperornithes
(earlier listed as isolated bones similar to <i>Enaliornis</i> by
Galton et al., 2009), but Agnolin and Varricchio (2012) believe it is
more similar to an azhdarchid proximal radius.<br>

Differs from other hesperornithines in- smaller size; dentary teeth
shorter, straighter and blunter; shorter dentary tooth row with fewer

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 2004 or
2005, this was first mentioned and figured as an undescribed specimen
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gansus</span>
in the supplementary information of Bailleul et al. (2019). 
O'Connor et al. (2021) presented it at an SVP
presentation as a new taxon "Brachydontornis zhangi", mentioned in the
abstract as that specimen with "blunt, relatively low-crowned teeth
placed in a communal groove".  It was named
and described by O'Connor et al. (2021 online) as "Brevidentavis
zhangi", but the paper has no
mention of ZooBank or an entry on the ZooBank
webite.  Thus according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work
must "be registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Brevidentavis zhangi" O'Connor
et al.,
2021 was a nomen nudum until September 2022.  Interestingly,
"Branchydontornis
zhangi" was used in the graphical abstract, tables 1 and 2 and figure
9 of the Early View version of the paper.  Creisler (DML 2021)
revealed he had suggested both names (the
other as "Brachyodontornis") and "The authors went with Brevidentavis
as the formal name, but the earlier contemplated name apparently was
not caught in editing."<br>
O'Connor et al. (2021, 2022) added it to O'Connor's bird matrix
and recovered it in a polytomy of hesperornithines.  Note the
trees
in their figure are majority rule and implied weighting.  Adding
it to
Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph analysis results in a sister group
relationship with <span style="font-style: italic;">Parahesperornis</span>,
although other positions in Hesperornithidae are only one step longer,
and other positions in Hesperornithes are two steps longer. 
O'Connor et al. (2022) say "Given the differences in dental and
dentary morphology and the absence of any postcranial remains that
could further support this placement, we do not consider <span style="font-style: italic;">Brevidentavis</span>
IVPP V26197 to be a hesperornithiform at this time", but while a
relationship with the later and deeply nested <span style="font-style: italic;">Parahesperornis</span> itself seems
unlikely, the smaller basal hesperornithine <span style="font-style: italic;">Enaliornis</span> is almost
contemporaneous.  Thus a hesperornithine identity may yet be
plausible.<br>

<b>Material</b>- (ZIN PO coll.) tibiotarsal shaft, distal tibiotarsi
(Nessov in Chauvire-Mourer, 1991) <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (in Mourer-Chauvire, 1991) first mentioned two
hesperornithine tibiotarsi from this locality, which may be this
material. Nessov (in Mourer-Chavire, 1992) mentioned small
hesperornithine material slightly larger than <i>Baptornis advenus</i>
and referred to Baptornithidae, but not <i>Baptornis</i> itself
because "of the peculiar structure of the fossa on the tibiotarsus,
related to the side of the foramen interosseum proximale, and because
the crista fibularis is not so strongly turned behind as in <i>Baptornis</i>,
and much weaker." Nessov and Yarkov (1993) reported these as
Baptornithidae indet., and Nessov (1997) commented on small
hesperornithine material, some of which he thought was possibly
referrable to <i>Baptornis</i>. Panteleev et al. (2004) thought this
was possibly based on juvenile specimens of <i>Asiahesperornis</i>,
while Dyke et al. (2006) thought it "probably pertains to a smaller
hesperornithiform taxon, an area for future work." As the traditional
Baptornithidae is paraphyletic and there is no evidence the
Zhuravlovskaya tibiotarsi are more closely related to <i>Baptornis</i>
than to <i>Hesperornis</i>, they are here placed as Hesperornithes
incertae sedis. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Kurochkin (1988) identified a distal tibiotarsus as <i>Baptornis</i>
sp., and later (1995, 2000) as closer to <i>Parahesperornis</i>.
Clarke and Norell (2004) described a similar specimen and referred both
to nonavian ornithurines (sensu Gauthier and de Queiroz), though they
did note characters were shared with <i>Baptornis</i> while
Kurochkin's <i>Parahesperornis</i>-like characters were disputed. They
were skeptical of referring isolated Cretaceous diving euornithine
specimens to Hesperornithines, though no reasons were given for
removing any of it from that clade, and it seems most parsimonious to
assume a single clade of Mesozoic taxa with hesperornithine-like limbs
until shown otherwise. The elements are more similar to <i>Enaliornis?
seeleyi</i> than <i>Baptornis</i> in the anteriorly rounded lateral
condyle in distal view, though the anterior intercondylar sulcus is
narrower as in <i>Baptornis</i>. The medial projection of the medial
condyle is intermediate between the two taxa, while the extensor groove
extends less distally than in both.<br>
Kurochkin (2000) mentioned "two further remains (a cervical vertebra
and the portion of a mandible) representing small hesperornithiforms
were collected by the JRMPE in the Nemegt Beds of Guriliin Tsav and
Tsagaan Khushuu" which were "somewhat different" from other
hesperornithines. The order of localities matches the order of
materials as shown by Kurochkin (1995) who mentioned a "Gurileen Tsav
(vertebra)."  He referred these to "Hesperornithiformes fam. nov."
along with the then unnamed holotype of <i>Brodavis mongoliensis</i>
from Bugin Tsav though he did not list any diagnostic characters. <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Galton and Martin, 2002b) posteromedial ridge
on distal portion of metatarsal II (unknown in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>;
also in <i>Hesperornis? mengeli</i>).<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Galton and Martin (2002a) cited additional
characters. The moderately sized antitrochanter is unlike <i>Baptornis</i>
<i>advenus</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>, but is symplesiomorphic as <i>Brodavis?
varneri</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> are comparable. The lack of a
femoral neck is caused by a lack of marked ventral concavity below the
head in some specimens (e.g. SMC B55287, B55289) and the lack of a a
proximal concavity between the trochanteric crest and head in other
specimens (SMC 55290, NHMUK A483). Thus it is not homologous, and it
varies within species as well. The medial tarsometatarsal cotyla is
reduced in all hesperornithines. The tarsometatarsus is distally arched
in all hesperornithines. Having the trochlea of metatarsals III and IV
subequal in size is plesiomorphic for hesperornithines, also found in <i>Pasquiaornis,
Baptornis</i> and <i>Brodavis? varneri</i>. The trochlea of metatarsal
IV does not extend dorsally past that of III, which is unlike <i>Pasquiaornis?
tankei </i>, <i>Baptornis</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>
but also plesiomorphically found in most other theropods such as <i>Gansus</i>.
<br>

Galton and Martin (2002b) also included the ventrally keeled anterior
synsacrum in their diagnosis, but this is only known for certain in <i>E.
barretti</i>. The hypotarsal ridge on metatarsal III is also present in
some <i>Hesperornis</i> species (e.g. <i>H. regalis</i> and <i>H.
chowi</i>). <br>

<b> Comments</b>- The first <i>Enaliornis</i> specimens may be bird
bones found in 1858 and noted by Lyell (1859), and a hesperornithiform
distal tarsometatarsus mentioned by Owen (1861). None of this material
was in the Woodwardian Museum (now part of the SMC) when Seeley
examined it in 1859 though (Seeley, 1866). Seeley (1864) mentioned two
new bird taxa in the title of an article ("Pelargonis sedgwicki" and
"Palaeocolyntus barretti"), but as nothing else was published, these
are nomina nuda. He later (1866) mentioned the name "Pelagornis
barretti" (note the genus was spelled correctly this time) in a summary
paragraph, which was also a nomen nudum. Because <i>Pelagornis</i> was
preoccupied by a pelagornithid "odontopterygiform" genus, Seeley (1869)
placed his two species in the new genus "Enaliornis." However, these
names are only used in a list of taxa which references a list of bones
at the Woodwardian Museum (now at the SMC), with no element referred to
any particular species. This makes them nomina nuda, as does Seeley's
statement that names used in the paper are not meant to take taxonomic
precedence. While Seeley does type "J. d, p.7" after <i>E. barretti</i>
and "p. 8" after <i>E. sedgwicki</i>, the specimens are listed in
order of tablet in their drawer, and those few on page 8 (tablets
18-20) don't seem to be purposefully separated from those on page 7
(tablets 1-17). Seeley (1876) finally described his two species
officially, also noting the prior use of "Palaeocolyntus" was a
misspelling of "Palaeocolymbus." However, he did not designate
holotypes for each species and left many specimens unfigured and
referred to in passing, often not assigned to a particular species.
Elzanowski and Galton (1991) redescribed the braincases, while Galton
and Martin (2002a, b) redescribed the postcrania. The latter two
references also excluded a number of remains from <i>Enaliornis</i>,
and Galton and Martin (2002b) revised the taxonomy of the genus,
assigning most elements to particular species and erecting the new
species <i>E. seeleyi</i>.<br>

YORYMG 584 was identified as an <i>Enaliornis</i> dorsal vertebra by
Seeley (1876), but is a posterior cervical vertebra of a
non-hesperornithine bird (Galton and Martin, 2002a, b). SMC B55286 is a
caudal vertebra identified as "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869) and <i>Enaliornis</i>
by Seeley (1876), but was reidentified as the testudine <i>Rhinochelys</i>
by Galton and Martin (2002b). SMC B55328 was stated to be a proximal
coracoid by Seeley (1869), and while possibly true, Galton and Martin
(2002b) and Galton et al. (2009) exclude it from Hesperornithes. This
will be redescribed by Galton (in prep.). One "Enaliornis" sacrum was
mentioned in the Woodwardian Museum by Seeley (1869), but it is
uncertain which of SMC B55281-55284 it was. <br>

(after Galton and Martin, 2002b) slope of lateral condyle continuous
with intercondylar sulcus that meets the medial condyle at an obtuse
angle.<br>

(proposed) centra of anterior synsacral centra transversely constricted
ventrally to form a median longitudinal ridge; anterior projection of
medial tibiotarsal condyle much wider than deep.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>-
Galton and Martin (2002b) proposed several additional diagnostic
characters. The large and rugose trochanteric crest in adult specimen
NHMUK A5803 (cited as diagnostic by Galton and Martin, 2002b) is also
present in <i>Hesperornis</i>, ontogenetically variable and is unknown
in <i>E? seeleyi</i>. The cnemial crest is no taller than in <i>E?
sedgwicki</i> and is actually less laterally flared compared to the
lateral extent of the proximal tibial articular surface. The increased
depth of the tibiotarsal condyles (minimum depth over half of
transverse width) may be plesiomorphic, as it is also present in <i>Gansus</i>.
The tibiotarsal condyles are even more massive anteriorly in <i>Hesperornis</i>,
while the medial condyle is massive in <i>E? seeleyi</i>. The
laterally positioned posterior intercondylar sulcus on the tibiotarsus
is also present in <i>E? sedgwicki</i>. Small, angular posterior
tibiotarsal condyles are also present in other <i>Enaliornis</i>
species and in <i>Baptornis</i>. The medial cotyla is not transversely
compressed in <i>Ichthyornis</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i>, <i>Hesperornis
bairdi</i> and <i>H. mengeli</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Brodkorb (1963) made <i>E. barretti</i> the type
species of <i>Enaliornis</i> and designated NHMUK A112 (as BMNH A112;
mistyped A1112) the lectotype, which is a cast of NHMUK A477. Seeley
originally catalogued (1869) and described (1870a, b) the braincase SMC
B54404 as a pterosaur. The partial pelvis BGS 87936 is misidentified as
87431 in the text and 87436 in figure 1 of Galton and Martin (2002b).
SMC B55277 and B55304-55306 were identified as "Enaliornis" by Seeley
(1869). While the referred femora were no doubt among the many noted to
exist by Seeley (24 femora from the Woodwardian Museum now at the SMC;
6 femora from the Jesson collection now at the NHMUK), they were not
identified to species in that work. SMC B55312 and 55313 were listed as
"Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869). SMC B55313 is no doubt one of the four
large proximal tibiotarsi referred to <i>E. barretti</i>
by Seeley (1876) (the others being SMC B55312, NHMUK A478, YOYRMG
587/8), so should be a paralectotype, contra Galton and Martin (2002b).
SMC B55316 is probably one of the two distal tibiae listed as
"Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869). Proximal metatarsus SMC B87932 is
misidentified as B17432 by Galton and Martin (2002b) in the section on
proximal tarsmetatarsal variation.<br>

SMC B55281 was identified by Seeley (1876) as a partial sacrum of <i>E.
barretti</i>, reidentified as a pterosaur notarium by Galton and Martin
(2002a), then identified again as a possible theropod sacrum by Galton
and Martin (2002b). SMC B55285 is a caudal vertebra identified as
"Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869) and <i>E. barretti</i> by Seeley (1876)
but was reidentified as Chelonia indet. by Galton and Martin (2002a)
and specified as <i>Rhinochelys</i> by Galton and Martin (2002b). <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Seeley, 1876) smaller than <i>E. barretti</i>
and <i>E. seeleyi</i>.<br>

(after Galton and Martin, 2002b) distal tibiotarsus with small anterior
medial condyle.<br>

(suggested) cnemial crest extends laterally significantly past proximal
tibial articular surface; medial tibiotarsal condyle wider than lateral
condyle.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- The laterally positioned posterior
intercondylar sulcus on the tibiotarsus is also present in <i>E.
barretti</i>. <i>Baptornis</i> also has medial and lateral anterior
tibiotarsal condyles which are equal in size, while <i>E. barretti</i>
also has a small lateral condyle and thus a broad shallow intercondylar
fossa. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- SMC B55314 is the proximal tibiotarsus with a cnemial
crest listed by Seeley (1869) as "Enaliornis." Brodkorb (1963)
designated it the lectotype of <i>Enaliornis sedgwicki</i>. SMC B55295
and 55297-55302 were identified as distal humeri of "Enaliornis" by
Seeley (1869), but later as distal femora by Seeley (1876; based on how
many distal femora he noted) and explicitly so by Galton and Martin
(2002b). SMC B55302 was identified by Seeley (1876) as "another species
of bird", and later by Galton and Martin (2002a) as <i>E. barretti</i>.
SMC B55288-55289 were identified as "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869). SMC
55287 is probably "Enaliornis" specimen "d 8 1" of Seeley (1869), as it
is the only SMC femur remaining after the others are taken into
account. NHMUK A479 wasn't originally identified to the species by
Seeley (1876), but was listed as a paralectotype by Galton and Martin
(2002b). SMC B55310 was identified as "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869).
While the referred femora were no doubt among the many noted to exist
by Seeley (24 femora from the Woodwardian Museum now at the SMC; 6
femora from the Jesson collection now at the NHMUK), they were not
identified to species in that work. NHMUK A480 was mentioned by Seeley
(1876) as a juvenile proximal tibiotarsus of <i>E. sedgwicki</i> from
the Jesson collection, so should be a paralectotype, though it was not
listed as such by Galton and Martin (2002b). SMC B55320 and 55332 are
two of the three "Enaliornis" distal tibiotarsi listed by Seeley
(1869). SMC B55320 and 55332 (and maybe NHMUK 41790) are probably some
of the several "smaller and less perfect" examples of distal
tarsometatarsi at Cambridge, said to have "belonged chiefly to <i>Enaliornis
sedgwicki</i>" by Seeley (1876).<br>

SMC B55274 (mistyped B55279 in the figures of Galton and Martin, 2002b)
and B55280 are dorsal vertebrae referred to <i>E. sedgwicki</i> by
Seeley (1876), but as they differ from hesperornithines, were placed in
Avialae incertae sedis by Galton and Martin (2002a, b).<br>

This species has been assigned to <i>Enaliornis</i> by every author
since its description, but this has been largely due to <i>barretti</i>
and <i>sedgwicki</i> being of similar size, locality and grade.
However, the posteromedial ridge on metatarsal II noted by Galton and
Martin (2002b) and metatarsal II trochlea which is mostly hidden in
anterior view may serve to group these species, <i>seeleyi</i> and <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
in a clade (though the ridge is unknown in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>). Also,
<i>barretti</i> and <i>sedgwicki</i> share the shallow anterior
tibiotarsal intercondylar groove and laterally placed posterior
tibiotarsal intercondylar groove (both absent in <i>seeleyi</i> but
unknown in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>). Another possibility is that <i>sedgwicki</i>
is more closely related to <i>Baptornis</i> and hesperornithids than
to <i>Enaliornis</i>. This could be supported by the reduced medial
femoral condyle (also present in <i>seeleyi</i>, but absent in <i>Baptornis</i>)
and metatarsal IV trochlea which is higher in distal view than trochlea
III (shared with <i>Pasquiaornis? tankei</i> as well).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Galton and Martin, 2002b) larger than <i>E?
sedgwicki</i> and smaller than <i>E. barretti</i>.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Galton and Martin (2002b), the cnemial
crest is flared laterally a comparable amount to <i>E? sedgwicki</i>,
though it primitively does not extend lateral to the proximal tibial
articular surface. The centrally positioned posterior intercondylar
sulcus and deep and narrow anterior intercondylar fossa on the
tibiotarsus are also present in <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>.
Rounded anterior tibiotarsal condyles are also present in <i>Hesperornis</i>.
The transversely compressed medial tarsometatarsal cotyla is also
present in <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>, <i>H. bazhanovi</i> and <i>H.
chowi</i>. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Seeley (1876) first noted he thought the <i>Enaliornis</i>
material probably belonged to three species, but only named two- <i>E.
barretti</i> and <i>E. sedgwicki</i>. Until Galton and Martin (2002b)
named <i>E. seeleyi</i>, only those species were recognized, so <i>seeleyi</i>
remains were at least implicitly referred to <i>E. barretti</i> or <i>sedgwicki</i>,
though much was never explicitly referred to either species. Much of
the <i>E. seeleyi</i> material was originally referred to <i>E.
barretti</i> by Seeley (1876) (NHMUK A478, SMC B55283, B55290, B55308,
B55318, B55319) and Galton and Martin (2002a) (NHMUK A478, SMC B55283,
B55290). Some was also referred to <i>E. sedgwicki</i> by Galton and
Martin (2002a) (SMC B55317, B55318, B55319). Elzanowski and Galton
(1991) referred both YORYMG 585 and 586 to <i>E. barretti</i>.
SMC B55290-55293 and B55307-55308 were identified as "Enaliornis" by
Seeley (1869). While the referred femora were no doubt among the many
noted to exist by Seeley (24 femora from the Woodwardian Museum now at
the SMC; 6 femora from the Jesson collection now at the NHMUK), they
were not identified to species in that work. NHMUK A5803 is listed as a
referred specimen for both <i>E. barretti</i> and <i>E. seeleyi</i>
in Galton and Martin's (2002b) material list, but is clearly <i>E.
barretti</i> based on the text and figures. Either YORYMG 587 or 588 is
the adult proximal tibiotarsus of <i>Enaliornis barretti</i> from the
Reed collection mentioned by Seeley (1876). YORYMG 587 is listed as <i>E.
seeleyi</i> in Galton and Martin's (2002b) materials list, but is <i>E.
barretti </i>based on the text and figures. NHMUK A481 was mentioned
by Seeley (1876) as a juvenile proximal tibiotarsus of <i>E. sedgwicki</i>
from the Jesson collection. SMC B55317 is probably one of the two
distal tibiae listed as "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869), and was
mislabeled B55310 by Galton and Martin (2002b) in their discussion of
distal tibiotarsal variation. SMC B55321 is one of the three
"Enaliornis" distal tibiotarsi listed by Seeley (1869). SMC B55321 (and
maybe NHMUK A485 a and b) are probably some of the several "smaller and
less perfect" examples of distal tarsometatarsi at Cambridge, said to
have "belonged chiefly to <i>Enaliornis sedgwicki</i>" by Seeley
(1876). "J d 5 1-2" (now SMC B55318-55319) were thought to be distal
metacarpals of "Enaliornis" (Seeley, 1869), then proximal fibulae
(Seeley, 1976), then proximal ulnae (Furbringer, 1888), but are
proximal tarsometatarsi. <br>

<i>seeleyi</i> was named based on material originally referred to <i>Enaliornis</i>,
but most of Galton and Martin's (2002b) justification for placing <i>seeleyi</i>
in <i>Enaliornis</i> was due to symplesiomorphies (see other diagnoses
section of <i>Enaliornis</i>' entry). However, the posteromedial ridge
on metatarsal II noted by Galton and Martin (2002b) and metatarsal II
trochlea which is mostly hidden in anterior view may serve to group <i>Enaliornis
barretti</i>, <i>E? sedgwicki</i>, <i>E? seeleyi</i> and <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
in a clade (though the ridge is unknown in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>).
Another possibility is that <i>seeleyi</i> is more closely related to <i>Baptornis</i>
and hesperornithids than to <i>Enaliornis</i>. This could be supported
by the reduced medial femoral condyle (also present in <i>sedgwicki</i>,
but absent in <i>Baptornis</i>). In either case, there is no valid
published reason to place seeleyi closer to <i>Enaliornis</i> than to <i>Pasquiaornis</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- All of the SMC material was originally referred to
"Enaliornis", but may belong to another bird or vertebrate taxon. SMC
B55323-B55327 were thought to be metacarpal fragments of "Enaliornis"
by Seeley (1869), but were reidentified as tibiotarsal shafts by Galton
and Martin (2002b), though not explicitly referred to <i>Enaliornis</i>,
let alone a particular species. A Woodwardian Museum specimen noted by
Seeley (1869) (J d 2 1) as a "fragment of a curved bone" of
"Enaliornis" is presumably at the SMC now, but has not been
reidentified in the literature. SMC B55296 was originally identified as
a distal humerus of "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869), but reidentified as
a distal femur by Galton and Martin (2002b), though not referred to a
particular species. The identity of Woodward Museum specimen "d 10 1",
listed as an undetermined element of "Enaliornis" by Seeley (1869) is
unknown.<br>

Most recently, Galton (in prep.) will describe seven bird elements from
the Booth Museum (mentioned as "<i>Enaliornis</i> and Aves incertae
sedis, including ends of humeri"). Galton et al. (2009) state <i>Enaliornis</i>
has rudimentary humeral heads, indicating the ends of humeri mentioned
are from that taxon.<br>

<p><b><i>Pasquiaornis</i></b> Tokaryk, Cumbaa and Storer, 1997<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Tokaryk et al. (1997) used the less laterally
projected trochanteric crest and less mediolaterally expanded proximal
femur to distinguish <i>Pasquiaornis</i> from <i>Baptornis</i>, but
this is primitive and also found in <i>Enaliornis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i>.
The intercotylar prominence is anteriorly positioned and overhangs the
shaft in <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i> as well. The
trochlea of metatarsal II is posterior to and close to the base of
trochlea III in all hesperornithines.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Both of these species were only briefly described and
illustrated by Tokaryk et al. (1997), and not compared to the similar <i>Enaliornis</i>.
This leaves them without a valid published diagnosis, nor are any
characters known which could group them together to the exclusion of
more derived hesperornithines.  To the contrary, the larger size
and metatarsal IV trochlear neck which is placed dorsal to that on
trochlea III are characters which <i>P? tankei</i> shares with <i>Baptornis</i>
and hesperornithids to the exclusion of <i>P. hardiei</i>. However,
officially removing <i>tankei</i> from <i>Pasquiaornis</i> should not
be done until the material of both <i>hardiei</i> and <i>tankei</i>
is examined in detail, including the Bainbridge River specimens. Bell
and Chiappe (2016) found both species to score identically in their
matrix, and emerge basal to <i>Enaliornis</i>,
but noted most material was unavailable for study.  More recently
Tanaka et al. (2018) gained access to the Bainbridge River material and
recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>
(scored as a single OTU) closer to hesperornithoids than <span style="font-style: italic;">Enaliornis</span>
(also a single OTU) based on three unambiguous characters, which also
matches stratigraphically.  Sanchez (2010) has described the
Bainbridge River material in his thesis.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Tokaryk et al., 1997) smaller than <i>P?
tankei</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Tokaryk et al. (1997) say the medial
tarsometatarsal cotyle is "deflected toward shaft", but those of most
hesperornithines are angled somewhat as well. The neck of trochlea III
being higher anteriorly than that of trochlea IV is primitive, being
present in <i>Enaliornis barretti</i> and <i>E? seeleyi</i> as well.
The "distal rim" of the femoral head is said to be perpendicular to the
shaft, but this does not appear to be true for either the rim of the
articular surface or the medial or ventral edges of the head. <br>
<b>Comments</b>-
Excavated in 1992 and 1993, this was first noted as a new species of
baptornithid by Cumbaa and Tokaryk (1993) before being described by
Tokaryk et al. (1997).  Tokaryk et al. (1997) reported that in
1994 and 1995 numerous bird fossils similar to <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
were discovered at the Bainbridge River Bonebed. Cumbaa et al. (2006)
states hundreds of bird specimens are known, mostly hesperornithine,
and illustrates four teeth. Sanchez et al. (2009) note both <i>P.
hardiei</i> and <i>P? tankei</i>
are represented in this material, which was described by Sanchez
(2010).  Type A teeth of Sanchez (2010) are here assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">P. hardiei</span> because they are
larger.  Sanchez lists RSMP2989.19 as "small, may be <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>."<br>
Cumbaa and Tokaryk mentioned two ichthyornithids from the Ashville
Formation of Saskatchewan, which were later described by Tokaryk et al.
(1997) as <i>Ichthyornis</i> species A (RSM P2077.11, P2077.67,
P2077.112 and P2487.5), <i>Ichthyornis</i> species B (RSM P2077.111)
and <i>I.</i> sp. indet. (RSM P2077.71). They referred the specimens
to <i>Ichthyornis</i> based on the coracoid scapular facet being
nearly parallel to the sternal end of the glenoid facet, which Clarke
(2004) noted was found in <i>Ichthyornis</i>, but not apomorphic.
Tokaryk et al. distinguished species A from species B by its gracility
and round (vs. angular) scapular facet. Longrich (2009) suggested the
Ashville coracoids did not resemble <i>Ichthyornis</i>, and were
referrable to <i>Pasquiaornis</i> based on their dimorphism (<i>P.
hardiei</i> vs. <i>P? tankei</i>), pachyostosis, and supposed lack of
coracoids in the <i>Pasquiaornis</i> material. Sanchez (2010) confirms
the coracoids are <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span> species A is
here placed in <span style="font-style: italic;">P. hardiei</span>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Tokaryk et al., 1997) larger than <i>P.
hardiei</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Tokaryk et al. (1997) also state the "distal
rim" of the femoral head is slanted toward the shaft, but the meaning
of this is uncertain. The medial tarsometatarsal cotyle is said to be
level in medial view, which is unlike <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i>,
but similar to <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Enaliornis? seeleyi</i>, so may
be plesiomorphic. The neck of trochlea III being lower anteriorly than
that of trochlea IV is present in <i>Enaliornis? sedgwicki</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i>
and <i>Hesperornis</i> as well. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Excavated in 1992 and 1993, this was first noted as a
new species of baptornithid by Cumbaa and Tokaryk (1993) before being
described by Tokaryk et al. (1997). As noted in the <i>Pasquiaornis</i>
comments, <i>tankei</i> may not belong to that genus and may be more
closely related to <i>Baptornis</i> and hesperornithids.  <br>
Tokaryk et al. (1997) reported that in 1994 and 1995 numerous bird
fossils similar to <i>Pasquiaornis</i> were discovered at the
Bainbridge River Bonebed. Cumbaa et al. (2006) states hundreds of bird
specimens are known, mostly hesperornithine, and illustrates four
teeth. Sanchez et al. (2009) note both <i>P. hardiei</i> and <i>P?
tankei</i>
are represented in this material, which was described by Sanchez
(2010).  Type B teeth of Sanchez (2010) are here assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">P. tankei</span> because they are smaller.<br>
Cumbaa and Tokaryk mentioned two ichthyornithids from the Carrot River
beds of the Ashville Formation of Saskatchewan, which were later
described by Tokaryk et al. (1997) as <i>Ichthyornis</i> species A
(RSM P2077.11, P2077.67, P2077.112 and P2487.5), <i>Ichthyornis</i>
species B (RSM P2077.111) and <i>I.</i> sp. indet. (RSM P2077.71).
They referred the specimens to <i>Ichthyornis</i> based on the
coracoid scapular facet being nearly parallel to the sternal end of the
glenoid facet, which Clarke (2004) noted was found in <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
but not apomorphic. Tokaryk et al. distinguished species A from species
B by its gracility and round (vs. angular) scapular facet. Longrich
(2009) suggested the Ashville coracoids did not resemble <i>Ichthyornis</i>,
and were referrable to <i>Pasquiaornis</i> based on their dimorphism (<i>P.
hardiei</i> vs. <i>P? tankei</i>), pachyostosis, and supposed lack of
coracoids in the <i>Pasquiaornis</i> material. Sanchez (2010) confirms
the coracoids are <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>,
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span> species B is
here placed in <span style="font-style: italic;">P? tankei</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Shufeldt (1903) named Hesperornithoidea to contain
both Enaliornithidae and Hesperornithidae. A clade to the exclusion of <i>Enaliornis</i>

the amphicoelous presacrals referred to <i>Enaliornis</i> are now
thought to belong to another taxon (Galton and Martin, 2002b). Bell and
Chiappe (2016) recovered this clade to the exclusion of <i>Enaliornis</i>
and <i>Pasquiaornis</i> in their phylogenetic analysis but left it
unnamed.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Martin and Lim, 2002) small size, with
tarsometatarsal length estimated at &lt;60 mm (also in <i>Pasquiaornis
hardiei</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martin and Lim (2002) also diagnosed this
species based on the deeply concave lateral femoral margin, which is
also present in <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Bryant first mentions the holotype as one of "several
femora including some very small (and presumably very young) ones
collected by myself and others working with a Los Angeles County Museum
field party in 1964", though it was undescribed at the time. Martin and
Lim (2002) believe the holotype is an adult due to its well formed
articular surfaces, but Bell and Chiappe (2016) stated the small size
"may be due to the immature ages of the specimen, which is difficult to
determine due to the poor preservation of the elements and in the
absence of histological data." Aotsuka and Sato (2016) referred femora
to <i>macdonaldi</i> from Manitoba based on their size. <br>
This species was described in <i>Hesperornis</i> by Martin and Lim.
However it has an uncertain placement, as the femora of hesperornithids
besides <i>Brodavis? varneri</i> and <i>Hesperornis regalis</i> are
still undescribed, and mostly unpreserved. The extreme robusticity is
shared with <i>H. regalis</i>, but seemingly not <i>H. bazhanovi</i>
or <i>Parahesperornis</i>. The strong anteroposterior compression of
the shaft is also shared with <i>H. regalis</i> but not <i>B? varneri</i>
or <i>H. crassipes</i>. However, the medial condyle is not distally
projected, unlike <i>B? varneri</i> and <i>H. regalis</i>. The small
size is unlike Hesperornithidae. Bell and Chiappe found <i>macdonaldi</i>
to code identically to taxa placed in <i>Hesperornis</i> here.<br>

Holotype</b>- (ZIN PO 3389) incomplete last dorsal vertebra (14.1 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) highly elongate dorsal vertebrae (~2.5
longer than posteriorly high).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (2000) listed dorsal central
articular surfaces transversely expanded, ventral surface of dorsal
centrum transversely narrow in middle and expanded posteriorly, and
prezygapophyses with little transverse separation in his diagnosis, but
then correctly noted these are general hesperornithine characters in
the comments section. In addition, he listed the trapezoidal dorsal
central articular surfaces in his diagnosis, but these are found in
other hesperornithines as well. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov and Borkin (1983) originally referred <i>Judinornis</i>
to the Charadriiformes, but it was reassigned to the Baptornithidae
without evidence by Nessov (1986). Kurochkin (2001) listed characters
shared with <i>Baptornis</i>, but these are plesiomorphic as noted in
the Baptornithidae comments. The holotype is indeed extremely similar
to <i>Baptornis</i>, though no synapomorphies seem evident. The low
central articular surfaces with projecting ventrolateral corners
indicate it is more derived than <i>Enaliornis</i>. Several characters
are more similar to <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Parascaniornis</i> than
to <i>Hesperornis</i>- the prezygapophysis is elongate and well
separated from the centrum in lateral view; ventral centrum surface is
transversely constricted; the transverse processes extend further
anteriorly.<br>

Holotype</b>- (MGUH 1908.214) posterior dorsal vertebra (15 mm)<br>
<b>Referred</b>- ?(RM PZ R1261) distal tarsometatarsus (Rees and
Lindgren, 2005)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1908 and described by
Lambrecht (1933) as a "scaniornithid" (<i>Scaniornis</i> is a Paleocene
bird variously allied with ciconiiforms or phoenicopteriforms).
Lambrecht originally spelled the species <i>stensiöi</i>, which must
be corrected to <i>stensioei</i> according to ICZN Article 32.5.2.1-
"in a name published before 1985 and based upon a German word, the
umlaut sign is deleted from a vowel and the letter "e" is to be
inserted after that vowel." Howard (1950) believed <i>Parascaniornis</i>
was a phoenicopteriform, but it was reidentified as a hesperornithine
by Nessov (in Mourer-Chauvire, 1990) and Nessov and Prizemlin (1991).
Rees and Lindgren (2005) reexamined this vertebra and found it to be
identical to <i>Baptornis advenus</i> and RSM P2306.2 of the Judith
River Group, except for the more horizontally directed prezygapophyses.
They viewed it as indeterminate within <i>Baptornis</i> and called it <i>Baptornis</i>
sp., but as Ford (online, 1995) notes, you cannot sink a named species
into "sp.". Instead, it would be named <i>Baptornis stensioei</i>,
though this combination is not yet published. However, Rees and
Lindgren did not list any derived characters that could be used to
place <i>stensioei</i> in <i>Baptornis</i>, nor even any shared
primitive characters. The low central articular surfaces with
projecting ventrolateral corners indicate it is more derived than <i>Enaliornis</i>.
In elongation, <i>Parascansiornis</i> is similar to <i>Baptornis</i>,
more elongate than <i>Hesperornis</i>, but less than <i>Judinornis</i>.
The prezygapophysis is elongate and well separated from the centrum in
lateral view, as in <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Judinornis</i>, but
unlike <i>Hesperornis</i>. The ventral surface is transversely
constricted and the transverse processes extend further anteriorly as
in <i>Baptornis</i> and especially <i>Judinornis</i>, but less than <i>Hesperornis</i>.
As <i>Parascaniornis</i> is roughly equally similar to <i>Baptornis</i>
and <i>Judinornis</i>, and shares to obvious apomorphies with either,
it is here retained in its own genus.<br>

more than <i>Baptornis</i> in size and crescent-peg articulations, the
latter of which are also known in <i>Parahesperornis</i> but
unpreserved in <i>Brodavis</i> and <i>Fumicollis</i> (these would
thus be hesperornithids but are not assigned to the family here because
exactly which phalanges have the character is unreported).<br>

<b><a name="Baptornithidae"></a>Baptornithidae</b> American
Ornithologist Union, 1910<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (<i>Baptornis advenus</i> ~ <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>)
(Martyniuk, 2012)<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martin and Tate (1976) included several
characters in their diagnosis for Baptornithidae, in which they
included <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Neogaeornis</i> (now thought to be a
gaviiform). The character "fully heterocoelous vertebrae" was supposed
to distinguish them from <i>Enaliornis</i>, but the amphicoelous
presacral vertebrae assigned to that taxon are now thought to belong to
another bird. The angled uncinate processes and elongate pygostyle are
unknown for any putative baptornithid except <i>B. advenus</i>, so are
made an apomorphy of that species here. The highly compressed pygostyle
and uncompressed patella of <i>Baptornis advenus</i> are unlike <i>Hesperornis</i>,
but unknown in other basal euornithines, so are provisionally made
apomorphies of that species. The unfused chevrons ("intercentral
bones"), slender coracoid, elongate preacetabular process, metatarsal
II trochlea which is less rotated ventromedially, open groove between
metatarsal trochlea III and IV, and comparatively small metatarsal
trochlea IV are primitive characters.<br>
Tokaryk et al. (1997) use some of the previous characters and the
slender femora to place <i>Pasquiaornis</i> in the Baptornithidae, but
this is also primitive.<br>
Kurochkin (2000) noted three characters he thought united <i>Baptornis</i>
with <i>Judinornis</i> in the Baptornithidae. Of these, a pneumatic
pit between the transverse process and prezygapophysis on dorsal
vertebrae is probably plesiomorphic, being present in <i>Ichthyornis</i>
as well. A ventrally flat centrum is only found in the last dorsal of <i>Baptornis
advenus</i>, as more anterior vertebrae are similar to <i>Hesperornis</i>
in having prominent hyapophyses. Yet the last dorsal of <i>Enaliornis</i>
also lacks hyapophyses, as do the last few dorsals of <i>Ichthyornis</i>
and <i>Gansus</i>, so this is a plesiomorphy. Some presacrals of <i>Baptornis
advenus</i> and <i>Brodavis? varneri</i> resemble <i>Judinornis</i>
in having a central pit on their articular surfaces. While these seem
to be absent in the two preserved presacrals of <i>Enaliornis</i>,
they are likely to be remnants of the amphicoelous condition in more
basal euornithines like <i>Ichthyornis</i>, <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Yixianornis</i>.
<br>
Martin and Cordes-Person (2007) note other characters supposedly
diagnostic of baptornithids. A smooth femoral patellar groove,
subcircular femoral shaft, and unreduced metatarsal II trochlea are
plesiomorphic. The cervical vertebrae of <i>Brodavis? varneri</i> are
said to be like those of <i>B. advenus</i> in being more elongate than
<i>Hesperornis</i> (and <i>Parahesperornis</i>), but this does not
seem to be true based on the photograph.<br>
Everhart and Bell (2009) diagnosed a Baptornithidae including <i>Baptornis</i>,
<i>Pasquiaornis</i> and FHSM VP-6318. The rounded intercotylar
prominence is a plesiomorphy compared to <i>Hesperornis</i>, while the
intermediate height between <i>Enaliornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>
cannot be used as a synapomorphy to exclude both of those taxa from a
baptornithid clade. Similarly, the indentations which partially
constrict the distal vascular foramen between metatarsals III and IV
are an intermediate state between the unconstricted <i>Enaliornis</i>
and the distally closed foramen in <i>Hesperornis</i>, and are also
seen in <i>Parahesperornis</i>. The infracotylar fossa and anteriorly
tilted cotyla are present in hesperornithids as well. Contra Everhart
and Bell, <i>Enaliornis barretti</i> and <i>E? seeleyi</i> also have
the groove on trochlea III deeper than that on trochlea IV. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Baptornithidae has been a paraphyletic taxon for
hesperornithines which are more basal than <i>Parahesperornis</i>, but
there is currently no evidence any other species was more closely
related to <i>Baptornis</i> than to <i>Hesperornis</i>. Taxa which
have been assigned to Baptornithidae in the past include <i>Eupterornis</i>
(Romer, 1933), <i>Neogaeornis</i> (Brodkorb, 1963), <i>Judinornis</i>
(Nessov, 1986) and <i>Pasquiaornis</i> (Tokaryk et al., 1997). The
former two are now thought to be gaviiforms (Brodkorb, 1963 and Olson,
1992 respectively), while the latter two are <i>Baptornis</i>-grade
hesperornithines. <br>

<p><i><b><a name="Baptornisadvenus"></a>Baptornis </b></i>Marsh, 1877<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- as for <i>B. advenus</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martin and Tate (1976) used the size as a
diagnostic character of <i>Baptornis</i>, but it is similar to <i>Pasquiaornis
tankei</i>. The greatly reduced forelimb is present in hesperornithids
as well, while the retention of the radius and ulna are plesiomorphies
also present in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>. Martin and Tate also
distinguished <i>Baptornis</i> from <i>Neogaeornis</i> by having a
less compressed tarsometatarsus, but this is true of all
hesperornithines. <br>
Tokaryk and Harington (1992) include a few dorsal characters in their
diagnosis. The heterocoely of dorsal four is present in all
hesperornithines. The narrower and lower posterior central articular
surface (compared to centrum length) is plesiomorphic, being present in
<i>Enaliornis</i> and <i>Judinornis</i> as well, while the lower
anterior central articular surface and small parapophysis are also
present in <i>Judinornis</i>. The centrally placed hypapophysis is
also present in <i>Hesperornis</i>.<br>
Martin and Cordes-Person (2007) list several synapomorphies of <i>Baptornis
advenus</i> and <i>"B." varneri</i>. As noted under Baptornithidae,
the cervical vertebrae of <i>varneri</i> do not appear to be more
elongate than those of <i>Hesperornis</i>, contra the text. The
absence of "vertebrarterial canals" (= transverse foramina) in <i>Baptornis</i>
seems implausible, as all theropods have diapophyseal and parapophyseal
articulations with their cervical ribs, and may refer to an absence of
fused cervical ribs instead. This is affected by ontogeny, and was not
stated to be certainly absent in <i>B. advenus</i> by Martin and Tate
in any case. Heterocoelous dorsal vertebrae and medial femoral condyles
which are smaller than the lateral condyle are present in all
hesperornithines. Pits in the posterior central articular surfaces of
presacral centra, a subcircular femoral cross section, a smooth
patellar groove and subequally sized tarsometatarsal trochlea are
primitive characters.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Several other taxa have been referred to <i>Baptornis</i>
in the past. Kurochkin (1988) referred a distal tibiotarsus from the
Nemegt Formation of Mongolia to <i>Baptornis</i> sp., but this is here
shown to resemble <i>Enaliornis? seeleyi</i> as well and thus referred
to Hesperornithes incertae sedis. Tokaryk and Harington (1992)
described a dorsal vertebra from the Judith River Group of Asakatchewan
as <i>Baptornis</i> sp., but the characters they used were
symplesiomorphic and the specimen is here referred to the <i>Baptornis</i>
+ <i>Hesperornis</i> clade as a nomen dubium. Nessov (1997) thought
some small hesperornithine material from the Zhuralovskaya Svita of
Kazakhstan could be referrable to <i>Baptornis</i>, but this
undescribed material is here referred to Hesperornithes incertae sedis.
Rees and Lindgren (2005) placed <i>Parascaniornis stensioei</i> in <i>Baptornis</i>
as <i>B. sp.</i>, which as noted in its description here was not based
on any synapomorphies. More recently, a specimen was described as the
new species <i>Baptornis varneri</i> by Martin and Cordes-Person
(2007), but this is based on a mix of symplesiomorphies and
synapomorphies of more inclusive clades as noted above. The species is
here placed as a basal hesperornithid and has been provisionally
reassigned to <i>Brodavis</i>. A distal femur from the Pierre Shale
group of Manitoba was initially identified as <i>Baptornis advenus</i>
by Aotsuka et al. (2012), but Aotsuka and Sato (2016) later described
it as <i>Brodavis sp.</i>. <br>

?(YPM 1467) femur, tibiotarsus (~125 mm) (Marsh, 1880)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Marsh, 1880) prominent medial tibial crest.<br>
(after Lucas, 1903) cervical vertebrae highly elongate; procoracoid
process absent.<br>
(proposed) uncinate processes angled dorsally at base; pygostyle longer
than four vertebrae; highly transversely compressed pygostyle; pubis
and ischium appressed; patella transversely wider than deep;
proximolateral fossa for fibula on tibiotarsus narrow and deep;
intertrochlear grooves on tarsometatarsus not extending proximal to
trochlea II.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1877) mentions only plesiomorphies-
metatarsal trochlea III and IV subequal in width and length.<br>
Marsh (1880) later mentions the slender femur, which is also
plesiomorphic.<br>
Lucas (1903) lists several features which differ from <i>Hesperornis</i>,
but most are plesiomorphic- short sacrum; elongate coracoid; radius and
ulna present; femur not projected transversely; high cnemial crest.<br>
The extreme transverse slenderness of the tarsometatarsus noted by
Shufeldt (1915) is also present in <i>Pasquiaornis hardiei</i>.<br>
Martin and Cordes-Person (2007) listed several characters for <i>B.
advenus</i>, most of which are plesiomorphic and also present in <i>Brodavis?
varneri</i>- heterocoelous dorsal vertebrae; subcircular femoral cross
section; smooth patellar groove in femur; tarsometatarsus with proximal
cap; metatarsal II trochlea which is less rotated ventromedially. The
lack of crescent and peg articulations on pedal digit IV phalanges is
also primitive, though unpreserved in <i>B? varneri</i> and other
non-hesperornithid hesperornithines. The femoral medial condyle is
actually larger than in <i>B? varneri</i> (as in <i>Pasquiaornis</i>),
not smaller as in <i>Enaliornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>. The
distal tibiotarsus being angled anteriorly is plesiomorphic as well,
being shared with <i>Parahesperornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The lectotype and paralectotype were discovered in
1876 and described by Marsh in 1877, though Shufeldt (1915) and Martin
and Tate (1976) confirmed they were from different individuals, as YPM
1465 is adult and YPM 5768 is juvenile. They designated YPM 1465 the
lectotype. The large humerus reported by Walker (1967) for KUVP 16112
is a tibial shaft. Elzanowski et al. (2001) state that there is no
quadrate catalogued under AMNH 5101, nor could any record of it be
found there. They furthermore believe that the quadrate was too small
to be derived from the specimen and question its referral to <i>Baptornis</i>,
though they do believe it is an "odontognath." Bell and Chiappe (2020)
stated "very small fragments of the quadrate and frontal of <span style="font-style: italic;">Baptornis</span>
(AMNH 5101) were previously reported, however no such elements are
included with the specimen today. ... Likewise, a fragment of the bill
was reported with <span style="font-style: italic;">Baptornis</span>
specimen KUVP 16112, however the specimen did not include material
identifiable as such when consulted for this study."  Martin and
Tate (1976) noted they examined specimens at the Fick Fossil Museum,
which are not described further, but are photographed on Oceans of
Kansas (Everhart, online 2005). Chiappe (1996) listed KUVP 2295 as a <i>Baptornis</i>
specimen, but probably meant KUVP 2290. Bell and Chiappe (2016) found
most referred specimens coded identically or near identically to each
other, but did not mention YPM 1467, YPM 5768 or the Fick Fossil Museum
specimen. UNSM 20030 was described by Martin and Tate (1976) as a
specimen of <i>B. advenus</i>, but Bell and Chiappe found it was
actually a more derived taxon sister to <i>Parahesperornis</i>+<i>Hesperornis</i>
and described it later (Bell and Chiappe, 2015) as <i>Fumicollis
hoffmani</i>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Elzanowski et al., 2001) distinct medial
depression for m. protractor pterygoidei et quadrati dorsal to orbital
process.<br>
(after Longrich et
al., 2011) (for Lancian Ornithurine D) shallowly concave, subtriangular
scapular facet; short,
deep, and weakly hooked acrocoracoid process; coracoid shaft
mediolaterally compressed and bowed dorsally; procoracoid hooked
ventrally around the triosseal canal; glenoid lateral to scapular
cotyle.<br>
(for Lancian Hesperornithiform A) short, broad metatarsus;
metatarsal IV subequal in length to metatarsal III; dorsal flange of
metatarsal IV does not extend the full length of the metatarsus; distal
metatarsus not twisted relative to proximal metatarsus; large and
proximally located depression for reception of metatarsal I.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Elzanowski et al. (2001) list the strongly
asymmetrical quadrate head, with the beak-shaped medial part
overhanging the otic process as an apomorphy, but note it is also
present in most palaeognaths, <i>Psophia</i>, <i>Cariama</i> and <i>Opisthocomus</i>.
Similarly, they list the presence of a quadratojugal buttress as
diagnostic, but then state it is also present in <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i>.
A pit on the medial part of the quadrate head and small orbital process
are also present in <i>Ichthyornis</i>, so are possibly
plesiomorphies. Elzanowski et al. state the low angle between the
lateral and medial condyles is diagnostic, as those of <i>Baptornis</i>
and hesperornithids are higher, but that of <i>Ichthyornis</i> is even
lower, making it a probable plesiomorphy. The smooth connection between
medial and "posterior" condyles is plesiomorphic (Clarke, 2004), while
contra Elzanowski et al., the lateral condyle is separated from the
posterior articular surface by a groove.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Elzanowski et al. (2001) do not describe the
tentatively referred paratype tarsometatarsi, merely stating they are
the right size to belong to <i>Potamornis</i>. The UCMP specimens are
identified as <i>Potamornis</i>
in the UCMP collections, but cannot be compared to the holotype. UCMP
159208, 187205 and 187206 are from the Danian (Paleocene), so were
presumably reworked. The coracoids were called Lancian Ornithurine D by
Longrich et al. (2011), who recovered it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>
using Clarke's bird matrix.  He suggested it "appears to be
closely
related to Judithian Ornithurine A" and that "both morphotypes closely
resemble coracoids described from the Carrot River Formation of
Saskatchewan", which have since been referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Pasquiaornis</span>.  Coracoid RSM
P2992.1 is tentatively referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis</span>
sp. nov. here while AMNH 22002 may be <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span>
based on provenence and UCMP 187207 could be <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis? baileyi</span>.  Indeed,
it's probable <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis</span> refer to the same concept,
and the Hell Creek material listed here might all be better referred to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis? baileyi</span>. 
Then again, Lancian Ornithurine D coracoids seem to be from a smaller
species than Lancian Hesperornithiform A tarsometatarsi (<span style="font-style: italic;">B? baileyi</span>-sized), and two
distinctly sized species are present in the Frenchman Formation. 
Which size class the <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span>
type quadrate falls into is unknown and none of the tarsometatarsi
listed as <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span> here
have been described or figured so cannot be compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis</span> species.<br>
While the lack of pneumaticity and quadratojugal buttress suggests <i>Potamornis</i>
is a hesperornithine, the lack of and elongate orbital process excludes
it from the <i>Parahesperornis</i> + <i>Hesperornis</i> clade.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1992) first commented on the possibility of
small volant hesperornithines based on small elements in North American
museums from the Late Campanian and Maastrichtian of the US and Canada.
No details were given, but Martin et al. (2012) eventually described
these tarsometatarsi including one from the Nemegt Formation previously
described by Kurochkin (2000) as species of the new genus <i>Brodavis</i>.
Further study will be necessary to determine whether the diagnosis
provided by Martin et al. includes synapomorphic characters, or merely
symplesiomorphies, and thus whether <i>B? baileyi</i>, <i>B? varneri</i>
and <i>B? mongoliensis</i> are properly referred to this genus. Bell
and Chiappe (2016) did find <i>baileyi</i> and <i>varneri</i> to
group together in their phylogenetic analysis, but did not test the
type species <i>B. americanus</i> or <i>mongoliensis</i>.  It's
likely material assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Potamornis</span>
belongs here as well, which may move the clade stemward of <span style="font-style: italic;">Baptornis</span>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Martin et al., 2012) facet for metatarsal one
placed below the middle of tarsometatarsus; metatarsal shaft broader
and more robust than in <i>B. baileyi</i> but is smaller and less
robust than <i>B? varneri</i>; trochlea for digit IV swollen
proximally, being slightly broader than the trochlea for digit III,
with broad and flat anterodistal surface.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Longrich et al.
(2011) described three tarsometatarsi as Lancian Hesperornithiform A,
noting similarity to what would be named <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis? mongoliensis</span> the
following year.  One (RSM P2315.1) was described as <span style="font-style: italic;">Brodavis americanus</span> by Martin et
al. (2012), and another (RSM MB.AV.705) is tentatively assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">B. americanus</span>
here based on provenance and size.  Note Longrich et al. also
propose a second smaller species Lancian Hesperornithiform B from the
same formation.<br>

vertebra, two dorsal ribs, posterior synsacrum, posterior ilia, pubes,
ischia, partial femora, tibiotarsus (206.47 mm), fibula,
tarsometatarsus (96.13 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Martin and Cordes-Person, 2007)
tarsometatarsus more robust than other hesperornithines.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martin and Cordes-Person (2007) list elongate
cervical vertebrae as a character of this species, but they are shorter
than in <i>B. advenus</i>. The capitulum and tuberculum of the
illustrated dorsal rib are similarly placed to <i>B. advenus</i>, not
necessarily more separated as stated by the authors, especially when
one considers that only two proximal rib portions are photographed for <i>B.
advenus</i>. The indistinct antitrochanter is a plesiomorphy shared
with <i>Enaliornis</i> <i>barretti</i>, while the open acetabulum is
also a plesiomorphy shared with taxa such as <i>Ichthyornis</i> and <i>Apsaravis</i>.
The well separated pubis and ischium is a plesiomorphy found in <i>Enaliornis</i>,
<i>Parahesperornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>. The proximolateral
ischial fossa is said to be more shallow than in <i>B. advenus</i> and
<i>Hesperornis</i>, but does not seem so in the photo. A broad
popliteal fossa is primitive, being present in <i>Enaliornis</i>, <i>Hesperornis</i>
and <i>Pasquiaornis? tankei </i>(but perhaps not <i>P. hardiei</i>),
whereas the fossa does not appear smoother in <i>varneri</i> than in
other hesperornithines. A shallow popliteal fossa is also present in <i>Enaliornis</i>,
while a wide intercondylar fossa is also present in <i>Enaliornis</i>
and <i>Hesperornis</i>. The prominent medial femoral condyle is also
present in <i>Enaliornis? sedgwicki</i>, and the lateral condyle does
not appear more "high and distinct" than in <i>B. advenus</i>. The
anteroposteriorly expanded proximal tibiotarsus and elongate fibular
crest (~59% of tibiotarsal length) are shared with <i>Hesperornis</i>.
The straightness of the fibular crest might refer to the fact it
doesn't seem to curve distally onto the anterior shaft as in <i>B.
advenus</i>, but polarity is difficult to establish. <i>Enaliornis</i>
shares the shallow proximolateral fossa for the fibula, making the
opposite state a possible apomorphy of <i>B. advenus</i>. Contra
Martin and Cordes-Person, the distal tibiotarsus does not curve
medially more than in <i>B. advenus</i>. Proximal foramina are present
in <i>Parahesperornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i> as well (and <i>Pasquiaornis?
tankei</i>), as noted in the description of FHSM VP-17312, making the
reported absence in <i>B. advenus</i> probably due to incomplete
preparation. Elongate intertrochlear grooves are also found in <i>Enaliornis</i>,
<i>Pasquiaornis</i>, <i>Parahesperornis</i> and <i>Hesperornis</i>,
making their absence an apomorphy of <i>B. advenus</i>. The
tarsometatarsi of all hesperornithines are waisted transversely just
proximal to trochlea II as in <i>varneri</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1991 and first
published in an abstract by Martin and Varner (1992), to be formally
described and named by Martin and Cordes-Person (2007). While most
published references refer the species to <i>Baptornis</i>, this is
based on a mix of symplesiomorphies and synapomorphies of more
inclusive clades as noted in the <i>Baptornis</i> other diagnoses
section. In contrast, there is some support for placing this species as
the basalmost hesperornithid, as seen in the Hesperornithidae diagnosis
above. Martin et al. (2012) included it in their new genus <i>Brodavis</i>
based on "overall shape of the tarsometatarsus" and the
symplesiomorphic small metatarsal IV trochlea compared to <i>Hesperornis</i>.
As this is vague and problematic reasoning and the authors themselves
state it "should probably have its own generic designation", this
assignment is provisional. However, Bell and Chiappe (2016) did recover
a phylogeny similar to my unpublished one where <i>varneri</i> is a
basal hesperornithid, and found <i>Brodavis? baileyi</i> to be its
sister group. The <i>Brodavis</i> type species <i>B. americanus</i>
was not included though, making it still uncertain whether <i>varneri</i>
should be referred to that genus.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Martin et al., 2012) external cotyla in

foramina are well developed; metatarsal facet for digit I placed almost
in the middle of the tarsometatarsus; metatarsal shaft slender;
transverse section in the middle of shaft close to quadrangular.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1987. Kurochkin (2000)
described it and mentioned a small mandible and cervical vertebra which
were "somewhat different" from other hesperornithines. He referred
these to "Hesperornithiformes fam. nov." though he did not list any
diagnostic characters. Kurochkin also related these to small
hesperornithine remains from the Zhuralovskaya Svita (Mourer-Chauvire,
1992), which are presently undescribed and generally referred to
Baptornithidae. The mandible and vertebral may be the same taxon as <i>B.
mongoliensis</i> and IGM 100/1311, which are of similar size and also
have thinner bone walls than <i>Baptornis</i> or <i>Hesperornis</i>.<br>

report this tarsometatarsus "shows the following features unique to
non-hesperornithid hesperornithiforms: (1) the proximally positioned
distal edge of metatarsal trochlea II which does not reach the base of
metatarsal trochlea IV; (2) metatarsal trochleae III and IV which
distally extend to a similar level; and (3) the equally mediolaterally

Bell and Chiappe did not mention the free caudals, pectoral elements or
humerus described by Martin and Tate, and reidentified the six pedal
phalanges. Bell (pers. comm., 2016) stated she didn't know "if the
material has been lost or was incorrectly attributed to 20030", but
that it wasn't catalogued with that number when she examined it. The
cololites include a jaw of the fish <i>Enchodus</i> cf. <i>parvus</i>.

femur more elongate and less proximally expanded. Contra Lucas, the
nasal processes do not appear shorter than <i>H. regalis</i>. While
the orbital quadrate process is much longer than <i>H. regalis</i>
specimen YPM 1206 as illustrated by Marsh, it is not much longer than
the actual specimen of YPM 1206 or KUVP 71012, making this difference
invalid.<br>
Martin (1984) stated <i>Parahesperornis</i>' skull was mesokinetic
(has a flexible frontoparietal joint), but this was later disproven by
Buhler et al. (1988). Two of the characters listed by Martin are
plesiomorphies compared to <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>- coracoid
elongate; tarsometatarsal trochlea IV smaller and less projected
distally. Contra Martin, the anterior lacrimal process is less extended
anteriorly than in <i>Hesperornis</i>. Crescent and peg articulations
on pedal digit IV are shared with <i>Hesperornis</i>. The tibiotarsus
is said to be less compressed than <i>Hesperornis</i>, but without
knowing the plane of depression this is vague.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1894 and referred to <i>Hesperornis
gracilis</i> by Williston (1896, 1898). Lucas (1903) described it as an
example of <i>Hesperornis gracilis</i>, using it to separate the
species as <i>Hargeria gracilis</i>. However, the ICZN dictates <i>Hargeria</i>
must stay associated with its type species regardless of what specimen
its description was based on. The mandible was illustrated by Gregory
(1951, 1952) as <i>Hesperornis gracilis</i> and Swinton (1975) as <i>H.
regalis</i>, while a tooth was illustrated by Martin et al. (1980) as
"a hesperornithid." Gregory (1951) argued the differences between <i>regalis</i>
and KUVP 2287 were insufficient for generic separation, partially
caused by inaccuracies in Marsh's illustrations. In 1952, he argued the
quadrate was not disimilar when compared to the actual material instead
of Marsh's illustration and that femoral differences could be caused by
crushing. Gingerich (1973) described the skull and stated <i>gracilis</i>
only differs from <i>regalis</i> in being slightly smaller, while in
1976 he deferred identification of KUVP 2287 to the species. Martin
(1983) proposed the new taxon <i>Parahesperornis alexi</i>
for KUVP 2287, but as Neas and Jenkinson (1986) note, it is not a
proper description as it lacks a diagnosis (ICZN Article 13.1.1). The
name is thus a nomen nudum until Martin's (1984) official description.
While Martin (1984) stated he had a full description in preparation,
one didn't appear until Bell and Chiappe (2020). Some cranial
morphologies were described by Buhler et al. (1988) and Witmer (1990).
Both Witmer and Elzanowski (1991) have noted various unfused cranial
sutures suggest it was not an adult but Bell and Chiappe say "compound
bone development is consistent with that of a fully-grown
individual."  Williston described a patch of material associated
with pedal scales as feathers, but Bell and Chiappe find "it is not
possible to confirm his interpretation."<br>
Martin (1984) mentions a partial tarsometatarsus of <i>Parahesperornis</i>
which was going to be described by Wetmore, but the paper was never
completed. <br>
KUVP 24090 was discovered in 1981.  Witmer (1990) says it includes
a "fragment of the articular region of the right lower jaw", but this
is not mentioned by Bell and Chiappe in their description.<br>
Bell and Everhart (2009) described tarsometatarsus FHSM VP-17312 as <i>Parahesperornis</i>
sp., which is slightly more elongate with a smaller trochlea III (about
half the size of IV). It was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">P. alexi</span> by Bell and Chiappe
(2020).  As it was discovered in the early 1990s, this cannot be
the specimen Martin mentioned.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (CFDC B.78.01.08; = BO 780108) tarsometatarsus (85.6
mm)<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Martin and Lim (2002) diagnosed this based on
its small size, which is probably primitive and still larger than <i>Hesperornis?
macdonaldi</i>. The more slender shaft is also plesiomorphic. Trochlea
III is not smaller compared to IV than in <i>Hesperornis crassipes</i>
and <i>H. rossicus</i>. Trochlea II is more hidden behind III in <i>H.
crassipes, H. rossicus</i> and <i>H. bazhanovi</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was described as a species of <i>Hesperornis</i>,
but its true position is more uncertain. The slender tarsometatarsus is
more primitive than the <i>Baptornis</i> + <i>Hesperornis</i> clade,
while the small size is unlike hesperornithids. However, the deep
proximodorsal metatarsal III fossa and enlarged metatarsal IV trochlea
are shared with the <i>Parahesperornis</i> + <i>Hesperornis</i>
clade. The distally projecting metatarsal IV is like <i>Hesperornis</i>,
but the rounded intercotylar process is not. The slender
tarsometatarsus and medial cotyla which is not transversely compressed
suggests it is not part of the large <i>Hesperornis</i> clade. It is
here tentatively assigned to the <i>Parahesperornis</i> + <i>Hesperornis</i>
clade, where it may be an extremely basal species of <i>Hesperornis</i>.
Bell and Chiappe (2016) found it to group with other <i>Hesperornis</i>
species in their analysis. They also noted the specimen number of the
holotype is BO 780108, not BO 780106 as reported by Martin and Lim.<br>

with a deep cavity below the transverse process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Hou studied the type remains in 1991 and described
them in 1999 as a new taxon of hesperornithid- <i>Canadaga arctica</i>.
While the diagnosis does distinguish <i>Canadaga</i> from <i>Baptornis
advenus</i> and <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>, the remains of other
hesperornithines are either not comparable or not described/illustrated
well enough to compare. The size (estimated tarsometatarsal length of
212 mm) is greater than other hesperornithids, which suggests it may be
referrable to the subgroup of large <i>Hesperornis</i> species.
However, no other characters are presently known which could resolve
where <i>Canadaga</i> belongs within Hesperornithes.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- While numerous species and specimens have been

as a separate genus. Yet no reasons for excluding the latter taxon from
<i>Hesperornis</i> have been given, and it clades within <i>Hesperornis</i>
when included in a phylogenetic analysis (Bell and Chiappe, 2016;
Mortimer, unpublished). Bell and Chiappe found all of these taxa to
code identically in their matrix and suggested the current named
species diversity is unsupported, though they did not create any new
formal taxonomy. <i>Hesperornis mengeli</i> and <i>H. macdonaldi</i>
were named by Martin and Lim (2002), but are here provisionally removed
from the genus though Bell and Chiappe found the first to only differ
from other <i>Hesperornis</i> by one character and the latter to code
identically to other <i>Hesperornis</i>.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- indeterminate relative to <i>H. regalis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1892 and described by
Marsh (1893) as a new taxon of hesperornithine, which he named <i>Coniornis
altus</i>. This was based on two characters- lateral condyle projects
distally further than medial condyle; medial condyle does not extend
medially past shaft. Shufeldt (1915a) believed Marsh only separated <i>Coniornis</i>
from <i>Hesperornis</i> on stratigraphic grounds, though he did not
officially place <i>altus</i> in <i>Hesperornis</i>. Shufeldt (1915b)
compared the element to <i>Hesperornis regalis</i> and found them
similar enough to place in the same genus, or even the same species. He
noted "where the condylar crests are more prominent in <i>Hesperornis</i>,
they have been broken off in Marsh's <i>Coniornis altus</i>." He thus
synonymized <i>Coniornis</i> with <i>Hesperornis</i>, which was
followed by Martin (1984) due to the compressed distal end. Indeed,
comparing the holotype to <i>H. regalis</i>, the two characters
described by Marsh could be eliminated by rotating the distal end of <i>altus</i>'
tibiotarsus so that the condyles are vertical instead of medially
tilted. There is an obvious plaster filled area just proximal to the
condyles where misalignment could have taken place. Once this is
corrected for, the tibiotarsi are extremely similar. YPM 515 seems to
have a more anteriorly projected lateral condyle, but this would again
be solved by rotating the distal area. The lack of a medial epicondyle
on YPM 515 could be due to damage. <br>
Shufeldt (1915a) described <i>Hesperornis montana</i> from a dorsal
vertebra found in the Claggett Shale of Montana and considered the
possibility YPM 515 was from the same beds (as the area was not well
segregated when it was collected), but felt it more likely that the
size difference indicated there were two species present. They are here
kept separate as many formations have more than one hesperornithid
species, and there is no overlapping material. <br>
The referred material from the Pierre Shale Group may be <i>H. bairdi</i>,
<i>H. chowi</i>, <i>H? macdonaldi</i> or <i>H? mengeli</i> based on
stratigraphy.  Martin et al. (2016) describe a pathology on YPM PU
17208D (as <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis sp.</span>
YPM PU 17208), noting it "is smaller than the common <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis regalis</span> of the Niobrara
Chalk, but it differs from the slender limbed, contemporary <span style="font-style: italic;">H. chowi</span>  by having a broader
tarsometatarsus with a more enlarged outer trochlea."<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Shufeldt (1915) reported on a dorsal vertebra
discovered in 1914, which he sent to Lull for examination. Lull
determined it most closely matched the last dorsal vertebra of <i>Hesperornis</i>,
differing only in minor ways, most of which also varied between
different spcimens of that genus. He concluded it was referrable to <i>Hesperornis</i>,
and only perhaps a new species due to stratigraphy. Shufeldt noted it
may have been found in the same beds as <i>Coniornis altus</i> but
thought it was too small to derive from the same species, so named it <i>Hesperornis
montana</i>. However, the ICZN dictates it must be emmended to <i>montanus</i>,
as <i>Hesperornis</i> is masculine.<br>
Marsh (1893) earlier described <i>Coniornis altus</i> from what may be
the same beds and while Shufeldt considered the possibility of synonymy
(as have later authors), he felt it more likely that the size

gracilis</i> by Marsh (1880). The holotype was discovered in 1876 and
briefly described by Marsh that year, but it was not illustrated until
Martin (1984). Williston (1896, 1898) referred KUVP 2287 to <i>Hesperornis
gracilis</i>, but it was later made the holotype of <i>Parahesperornis
alexi</i> by Martin (1984). Lucas (1903) also believed KUVP 2287 was
referrable to <i>gracilis</i> and used it as the basis for
transferring that species to his new genus <i>Hargeria</i>. However,
the ICZN dictates <i>Hargeria</i> must stay associated with its type
species regardless of what specimen its description was based on. Lang
(1973) placed a species of leptocheliid tanaidacean <i>Leptochelia
rapax</i> Harger, 1879 into the new genus <i>Hargeria</i>. Thus the
crustacean <i>Hargeria</i> is preoccupied by the bird <i>Hargeria</i>,
contra Bell and Everhart (2009). Martin (1984) synonymized <i>Hargeria</i>
with <i>Hesperornis</i>, but retained <i>gracilis</i> as a distinct
species. The taxon needs to be described in detail to determine how it
compares to other <i>Hesperornis</i> species.<br>
YPM 1679 was referred to <i>H. gracilis</i> by Marsh (1880), but only
listed as <i>Hesperornis</i> sp. by Chiappe (2002) and the YPM
catalog. YMP 55000 is listed as <i>Hesperornis gracilis</i> in the YMP
catalog, but as <i>Hesperornis sp.</i> by Bell, Irwin and Davis (2015).<br>

However, the more elongate tarsometatarsus and slender lateral anterior
metatarsal ridge are plesiomorphic, while the fourth trochlea is not
more enlarged compared to trochlea III. A short medial anterior

outline in proximal view; indistinct triangular surface on posterior

Nicholls' (1988) thesis and Aotsuka et al.'s (2012) thesis as <i>Hesperornis

UA 9716 was discovered in 1972 and described by Fox (1974) as <i>Hesperornis
cf. regalis</i>. He noted it was more similar to <i>regalis</i> than
to <i>crassipes</i> in being slender and lacking the metatarsal II
tuberosity of <i>crassipes</i>, though it is slightly larger. However,
the lack of a rugosity is plesiomorphic and the width / length ratio
(4.47) resembles <i>H. gracilis</i> (4.45) more than <i>H. regalis</i>
(4.00-4.13). Nessov and Yarkov (1993) thought it possibly belonged to
"another more advanced species", and indeed it was referred to Aotsuka
and Sato's new species <i>H. lumgairi</i> by those authors.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Marsh, 1875a, b) seventh through tenth caudal
vertebrae with extremely long and flattened transverse processes
(unknown in other hesperornithids); pygostyle extremely broad and
flattened (unknown in other hesperornithids).<br>
(after Marsh, 1876) four sternal rib articulations; deep posterolateral
excavations in sternum.<br>
(after Marsh, 1877) radius, ulna and manus absent (unknown in other
hesperornithids).<br>
(after Lucas, 1903) fourteen sacral vertebrae (unknown in other
hesperornithids; also in Aves).<br>
(after Witmer, 1990) medial pneumatic lacrimal fossa small and shallow
(unknown in other <i>Hesperornis</i>); articular lacks pneumaticity
(unknown in other <i>Hesperornis</i>; also in <i>Patagopteryx</i>).<br>
(proposed) scapular expanded distally (unknown in other
hesperornithines; also in <i>Songlingornis</i>); humerus longer than
scapula (unknown in other hesperornithines; also in <i>Gansus</i> and <i>Yanornis</i>);
<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh's (1872a) original paper only described a
few characters, which are either more broadly distributed among
hesperornithines (short femur, elongate tibiotarsus) or incorrect
(unfused metatarsals).<br>
Marsh's (1872b) later description mentions several features as being
distinctive, but these are either primitive (trochanteric crest less
expanded anteroposteriorly than in grebes; supratendinal groove absent;
hypotarsal grooves absent) or found in other hesperornithines (femur
with compressed cross section; metatarsal IV longest; trochlea IV
enlarged; pedal digit IV with crescent and peg articulations between
phalanges). <br>
Marsh (1875a, b) mentions several characters as being distinctive,
though the described proximal caudal morphology (short centra, moderate
sized transverse processes and tall neural spines) is primitive. The
partially closed acetabulum is present in some other hesperornithines
as well.<br>
In 1877, Marsh noted <i>Hesperornis</i> was also distinctive for
having dentary teeth placed in grooves (also in <i>Parahesperornis</i>),
a sternum without a keel (probably also in <i>Baptornis</i>), and a
hindlimb with diving adaptations (too vague, and found in other
hesperornithines in any case).<br>
Lucas (1903a) noted the femur was articulated so that it projected
transversely, which is also now known to be true in <i>Parahesperornis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1871, though another
specimen (YPM 1205) was discovered in 1870 but not recognized as such
until Marsh (1875a, b). Marsh (1872a) gave a very brief commentary on
the holotype, to be followed by a more detailed description in 1872b.
Marsh (1875a, b) added details from a more complete specimen with a
skull (YPM 1206). Marsh (1880) monographed the taxon, using the
holotype, YPM 1206, 1207, 1476 and 1477. He misidentified the
predentary as a basihyal (Martin and Naples, 2008). Palatal elements
have been controversial- a structure was identified by Marsh (1880) as
a vomer, Gingerich (1973, 1976) as a palatine, and Elzanowski (1991) as
an anterior pterygoid. Another element was identified as a palatine by
Marsh, a vomer by Gingerich, and a composite maxilla and palatine
fragment by Elzanowski. Witmer and Martin (1987) identified elements as
a paired vomer which Elzanowski identified as palatines. Bock (1969)
questioned whether <i>Hesperornis</i> was really toothed, but their
presence in its jaws is unambiguous. Although the YPM lists YPM
1201-1204 as paratypes, Marsh 1872a only mentions one specimen in his
initial description. These are probably the four specimens mentioned in
Marsh 1872b. Note Gregory (1951) incorrectly called YPM 1206 the type. <br>
While <i>Hesperornis</i> specimens have generally been thought to be
limited to the Early Campanian <i>Hesperornis</i> Zone of the Smoky
Hill Chalk, Everhart (2011) showed that the holotype and several other
specimens (FSHM 186, 349 and 2069, UNSM 1212, USNM 13581, and YPM
1202-1204) are actually from the earlier <i>Spinaptychus sternbergi</i>
Zone. As it is unclear from the literature and online databases which
specimens (if any) are actually from the <i>Hesperornis</i> Zone, they
are not distinguished in this material list. It's also possible that
other bird material listed on this site as being from the <i>Hesperornis</i>
Zone is actually from the <i>Spinaptychus sternbergi</i> Zone.<br>
Several specimens from other formations have been referred to <i>Hesperornis
regalis</i>. Russell (1967) mentioned many specimens from the Smoking
Hills Formation of the Northwest Territories. Bardack (1968) referred
several specimens from Manitoba to <i>H. regalis</i> (FMNH PA216-219,
MM V-532). Witmer (1990) noted differences in some Manitoban material,
but Aotsuka and Sato (2016) referred FMNH PA218 to <i>H. regalis</i>,
and FMNH PA216-217 and MM V-532 to <i>H. sp.</i>. Fox (1974) referred
a tarsometatarsus from the Foremost Formation of Alberta to <i>Hesperornis
cf. regalis</i>, though this seems untrue based on its proportions.<br>

<i>Hesperornis</i> Zone of the Smoky Hill Chalk Member of the Niobrara
Formation, Kansas, US</b> <br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (YPM 1474) partial skeleton including dentary
fragment, anterior angular, teeth, atlantal centrum, fourth cervical
vertebra (24 mm), coracoid, clavicle (~80 mm), sternum (196 mm),
partial femur (103 mm), patella (109 mm), tarsometatarsi (135 mm),
phalanx II-1 (40.5 mm), phalanx III-1 (39 mm), phalanx IV-1 (42 mm),
phalanx IV-2 (38 mm)<br>
<b>Referred</b>- ?(AMNH 5102) incomplete tarsometatarsus (Nessov and
Yarkov, 1993) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Marsh, 1876) shallow posterolateral excavation
in sternum; large proximolateral rugosity on metatarsal II.<br>
(proposed) coracoid articulations on sternum widely separated (unknown
in other <i>Hesperornis</i>; also in <i>Patagopteryx</i>). <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh (1876) also noted the sternum had five
rib articulations as opposed to <i>H. regalis</i>' four, but this is
primitive as <i>Baptornis</i> and <i>Ichthyornis</i> also have five.
The less excavated posterolateral sternal margin has uncertain
polarity, as <i>Ichthyornis</i>' is also shallow, whereas <i>Gansus</i>'
is very deep.<br>
Contra Marsh (1880), the tarsometatarsus does not appear more robust
than in <i>H. regalis</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1876, the specimen described that year
by Marsh as a new genus of hesperornithid. Marsh (1880) placed it in <i>Hesperornis</i>
without comment, provided illustrations and further measurements. The
angular is illustrated by Gregory (1952). The species was accepted as
valid by Martin (1984), but it desperately needs to be redescribed. The
tarsometatarsus as illustrated by Marsh is quite distinct in shape from
other <i>Hesperornis</i>, but the taxon clades within <i>Hesperornis</i>
when included in phylogenetic analyses (Mortimer, unpublished; Bell and
Chiappe, 2016).<br>

?(CFDC B.2010.01.23) proximal tarsometatarsus (Aotsuka et al., 2012;
described by Aotsuka and Sato, 2016) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Nessov and Yarkov, 1993) adult size with
tarsometarsus over 150 mm long (also in <i>Canadaga</i>).<br>
(after Kurochkin, 2000) proximal end of tarsometatarsus over 160% wider
than deep.<br>
(after Panteleev et al., 2004) tarsometatarsal trochlea IV over 250% as
wide as trochlea III in anterior view.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (2000) listed several diagnostic
characters. The proximal tarsometatarsal articular surface is not more
diagonally oriented than in <i>H. crassipes </i>or <i>H. bairdi</i>.
The lateral edge of the lateral cotyla does not extend proximally past
the intercotylar eminance, contra Kurochkin. He states the medial
cotyla is located more distally than the lateral cotyla, which may be
the same character as Rees and Lindgren's (2005) "cotyla medialis
slopes distally in regard to the nearly horizontal plane formed by the
cotyla lateralis." However, it seems Rees and Lindgren mistook their
proximal metatarsus SGU 3442 Ve01 as a left element when it is in fact
from the right side. Perhaps Kurochkin made the same mistake with the
holotype, as the lateral condyle is more distally placed in all
specimens, which is typical of hesperornithids. <br>
Panteleev et al. (2004) noted the inner toes were reduced, and while it
seems trochlea IV was indeed enlarged compared to III, the size of II
is uncertain due to damage. The absence of a ginglymoid trochlea II and
III is shared with <i>Hesperornis mengeli</i>, while trochlea II is
equally hidden behind metatarsal III in <i>H. bazhanovi </i>and<i>
crassipes</i>.<br>
Rees and Limdgren (2005) listed a few additional diagnostic characters.
They state the cotyla have less curvature, but this seems untrue of
lateral cotyla at least, while the concavity of <i>H. bazhanovi's</i>
medial cotyla does not seem very different. The intercotylar eminence
does not seem more pointed than <i>Hesperornis bazhanovi</i>, <i>H.
chowi</i> or <i>H. bairdi</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This species was originally named <i>H. rossica</i>,
but must be emended to <i>rossicus</i> as <i>Hesperornis</i> is
masculine (Kurochkin, 2000). The holotype was first reported by Nessov
(in Mourer-Chauvire, 1991) as "an advanced hesperornithiform." The two
vertebral fragments and pedal phalanx were referred to <i>H. rossicus</i>
by Nessov and Yarkov (1993), though Kurochkin and Rees and Lindgren
(2005) felt this was problematic due to the presence of ZIN PO 5099.
ZIN PO 5099 was originally referred to <i>Hesperornis</i> sp. by
Nessov and Yarkov (1993), but determined to be a young specimen of <i>H.
rossicus</i> by Panteleev et al. (2004). Thus only <i>H. rossicus</i>
is known from that locality, which makes the referral of the vertebrae
and phalanx more probable. Yarkov and Nessov (2000) referred a
tarsometatarsal fragment reworked to Paleocene deposits at Bereslavka
to Hesperornithidae indet., but Panteleev et al. (2004) referred it to <i>H.
rossicus</i>. Yarkov and Nessov also described a proximal
tarsometatarsus and dorsal vertebra as <i>Hesperornis sp.</i>, which
is tentatively referred to <i>H. rossicus</i> here, as it is from the
same locality. Rees and Lindgren (1999, 2005) described a dorsal
vertebra and partial tibiotarsus as <i>Hesperornis</i> sp., but these
are here provisionally referred to <i>H. rossicus</i> due to the
presence of only one known hesperornithid at that locality and their
large size. LO 9067t had been previously mentioned as a possible large
hesperornithine by Nessov (in Mourer-Chauvire, 1992).<br>

? two distal tibiotarsi, proximal tarsometatarsus (Nessov in
Mourer-Chauvire, 1992) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Nessov and Prizemlin, 1991) (?) medial
tibiotarsal condyle markedly compressed transversely; (?) anterior
intercondylar groove deep; (?) scar for the attachment of the first
metatarsal is very small, located proximally on the shaft.<br>
(proposed) round fossa around distal vascular foramen between
metatarsals III and IV.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurochkin (2000) listed the characters from
Nessov and Prizemlin's (1991) diagnosis (which has not been translated
from Russian) which he considered were not generalized hesperornithine
characters. The gracility and parallel sides of the tarsometatarsus are
plesiomorphies compared to <i>Hesperornis regalis</i>. The sharp
posterolateral tarsometatarsal crest is also present in <i>Hesperornis
bairdi</i>, while a sharp posteromedial crest is present in <i>H.
bairdi, H? mengeli</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i>. A deep
proximodorsal metatarsal III fossa is also present in <i>Hesperornis</i>
and <i>Parahesperornis</i>, while those of <i>H. regalis</i> and <i>H.
chowi</i> are equally narrow. The high dorsolateral crest by this
feature is not easily observable in the figures, so cannot be compared
to other taxa. <i>Hesperornis chowi</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i>
also have an expanded fossa distally between metatarsals III and IV,
though they are not as round as in <i>Asiahesperornis</i>. Trochlea IV
is larger compared to III in <i>Hesperornis crassipes, H? mengeli</i>
and <i>H. rossicus</i> than in <i>bazhanovi</i>. The remaining
characters listed above aren't possible to see in the published
figures, making comparison to other taxa and thus their diagnostic
status uncertain. However, compressed medial tibiotarsal condyles and
deep intercondylar grooves are present in most derived hesperornithines.<br>
Dyke et al. (2006) listed a couple additional features in their
diagnosis. <i>Hesperornis</i> and <i>Parahesperornis</i> also have
prominent medial and lateral grooves on the dorsal tarsometatarsus
between the metatarsals. <i>Hesperornis regalis</i> and <i>H. bairdi</i>
both have well developed grooves on the posterior surface of their
third trochlea.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The type material was first reported by Prizemlin and
Nessov (in Mourer-Chauvire, 1990) as "a large hesperornithiform bird of
a new genus, and maybe a new family." Nessov and Prizemlin (1991) later
described it as the new genus <i>Asiahesperornis</i>, which they
placed in a new subfamily Asiahesperornithinae. Yet comparisons suggest
the species is more similar to <i>Hesperornis regalis</i> than some
other species assigned to that genus such as <i>H. gracilis</i>, <i>H.
bairdi</i> and <i>H? mengeli</i>, where is is resolved in phylogenetic
analyses (Mortimer, unpublished; Bell and Chiappe, 2016). Thus it is
placed within <i>Hesperornis</i> here, in a combination not seen in
the literature.<br>
The stratigraphy of the Kushmurun Quarry where <i>Asiahesperornis</i>
is found has been controversial, with Dyke et al. (2006) assigning it
to the Zhuravlovskaya Svita, not the Eginsaiskaya Svita as found in
Nessov in Mourer-Chauvire (1992) and Kurochkin (2000). IZASK 5/287/86
was originally misidentified as a cervical vertebra by Nessov and
Prizemlin (1991), but reidentified by Kurochkin (2000). This material
is only provisionally referred to a single taxon of hesperornithine,
based on size. Nessov and Yarkov (1993) later illustrated IZASK
5/293/87 and 5/287/86B as merely "hesperornithiforms" and provisionally
assigned IZASK 5/287/86b to another species, but Dyke et al. found no
reason to doubt their assignment to <i>Asiahesperornis</i>. 
Bell and Chiappe (2020) stated dentary IZASK 4/KM 97 "shows clear
alveoli for the teeth. As this is not the case among other
hesperornithiforms, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Asiahesperornis</span>
material consists entirely of unassociated elements, it is unlikely
this specimen belongs to a hesperornithiform bird" and reassigned it to
Aves incertae sedis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1962 and described by
Bryant (1983) as <i>Hesperornis</i> sp.. He found no differences
between it and <i>H. regalis</i> specimen USNM 13580, and thought
differences from the <i>H. regalis</i> holotype were due to age.
However, other hesperornithines are difficult to compare, so the
generic assignment should be provisional.<br>

in June 1988 and was listed by Wilson and Chin (2014) as one of the
"Arctic specimens identified as hesperornithiforms in museum
collections", but is currently identified as indet. in the collection
so is probably one of the specimens which "could not be confidently
attributed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis</span> or
even Aviale."  <br>
TMP 1997.004.0001 was found in July 1992 and was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis</span> sp. by Hills et al.
(1999).  <br>
NUVF 286 was found in 2003, initially described in Wilson's (2012)
thesis.  The latter states "a few associated bones below the
specimen could not be collected because they were frozen in
permafrost."  The thesis was later published as Wilson and Chin
(2014) for the histology and Wilson et al. (2016) for the anatomy,
where it is referred to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis
sp.</span>.  This is due to the uncertain status of <span style="font-style: italic;">Canadaga</span> and controversial synonymy
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornis</span> species, but
they do say it is more robust than <span style="font-style: italic;">Parahesperornis</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Several specimens were referred to <i>H. regalis</i>
by Bardack (1968). Nicholls and Russell (1990) stated 170 specimens of <i>Hesperornis</i>
were known from the Pembina Member, which presumably included those
listed above whose CFDC catalog numbers indicate they were catalogued
before this (the number after the B). These were detailed by Aotsuka
and Sato (2016), who assigned most to <i>Hesperornis sp.</i>.<br>

Zelenkov et al. (2017) listed several differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">H. rossicus</span> that resembled <span style="font-style: italic;">H. regalis</span> instead.  They
stated "the only essential difference of the specimen described here
from <span style="font-style: italic;">H. regalis</span>
is the absence in proximal view of a distinct incisure in the dorsal
margin of the bone medial to the eminentia intercotylaris (this

Zelenkov et al. list several characters distinguishing distal
