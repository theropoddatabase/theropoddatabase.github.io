<b>Comments</b>- Osborn (1924) described <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> as an ornithomimid based
on the toothless jaws, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
was originally (Sternberg, 1940) assigned to its own order
Caenagnathiformes believed to be closer to crown Aves than
hesperornithines or <span style="font-style: italic;">Ichthyornis</span>.&nbsp;
Cracraft (1971) further placed caenagnathiforms closest to
galloanserines based on the sliding mandibular glenoid.&nbsp; Osmolska
(1976) first noticed the similarity between her '<span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor sp.</span>' (actually <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>,
assigning both to Caenagnathidae within Theropoda.&nbsp; "The
caenagnathids may represent a Cretaceous continuation of the same
dinosaur lineage that gave rise to the birds", she said, and "a new
suprafamilial taxon will have to be established as soon as the new
material of <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> has
been described."&nbsp; This was done that same year when Barsbold
(1976) erected Oviraptorosauria (incorrectly attributed in his paper to
Barsbold, 1974) for oviraptorids.&nbsp; He wrote "the difference in
the type of [edentulous] structure itself and undoubtedly the ecology
of the oviraptorids and the ornithomimids are so great that their
separation is presently fully valid."&nbsp; Barsbold viewed
oviraptorosaurs as potentially diverging early from 'coelurosaurs'
(coelophysoids and coelurid/compsognathid-grade taxa) due to supposedly
primitive characters like the 'interclavicle' (actually a furcula
unrecognized in other theropods at the time).&nbsp; By 1981 Barsbold
had read Osmolska's paper and agreed with her the genera were closely
related but wrote "considerable differences in the structure of the
lower jaw of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
make it necessary to assign them to different families, which enter the
infra-order Oviraptorosauria."&nbsp; Currie and Russell (1988) were the
first authors to recognize <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span>
and the 'elmisaurids' (caenagnathid manus and pedes) belonged to
Oviraptorosauria, but in 1994 Russell and Dong tried to expand the
concept to include therizinosaurs, troodontids and ornithomimosaurs as
well.&nbsp; Besides a few suggestions therizinosaurs might belong, this
more inclusive Oviraptorosauria was not followed, and with the addition
of basal taxa like <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>
the group's content remains similar to this day.&nbsp; Note references
to an "Oviraptorosauridae" as in Norell et al. (2000) are in error as
there is no genus "Oviraptorosaurus" to base it on.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> was described in 1981
as closer to Aves than other theropods known at the time, then in the
1990s was associated with arctometatarsalian coelurosaurs.&nbsp; Currie
(1989) was prescient in saying "similarities in the foot suggest that <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> may have been derived from
elmisaurid dinosaurs" but <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
was first assigned to Oviraptorosauria in the first TWiG analysis
(Norell et al., 2001).&nbsp; Chatterjee (1991) created a classification
for Mesozoic birds where "each Mesozoic avian genus has been assigned
to a corresponding higher level taxon or order" and so proposed an
Avimimiformes for <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>,
which has been ignored since then for being monotypic.<br>
Sereno (online 2005) proposed the name Oviraptoriformes "to accommodate
clades most closely related to Oviraptorosauria", with the phylogenetic
definition "the most inclusive clade containing <em><em><em>Oviraptor</em>
philoceratops</em></em> Osborn 1924 but not <em>Passer domesticus</em>
(Linnaeus 1758)."&nbsp; Yet online citations do not count for
nomenclature. Benson (2008) is the first author to publish the name
Oviraptoriformes, though he did such undefined in a phylogram without
comment or definition.&nbsp; Holtz (2012) stated "<span class="st">Therizinosauria
and Oviraptorosauria may together form
a clade Oviraptoriformes" but again provided no definition.&nbsp;
Martyniuk (2012) created a stem-based definition for Sternberg's (1940)
Caenagnathiformes, generally unused since the 1970s, as all taxa closer
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus collinsi</span> than
to <span style="font-style: italic;">Passer domesticus</span>,
which seemed more like an attempt to replace the newer Oviraptorosauria
since he placed therizinosaurs further from birds.&nbsp; Yet it would
work for a topology in which therizinosaurs were closer to
oviraptorosaurs than to birds, is published with a proper definition
and is an older name than Oviraptoriformes.<br>
Paul (2016) used the informal term oviraptorosauriforms for
"omnivoropterygids, oviraptorosaurs, and avians and their common
ancestor, operative only if three groups form a clade that excludes all
other dinosaurs."&nbsp; This would imply an 'Oviraptorosauriformes'
with a partial definition (<span style="font-style: italic;">Omnivoropteryx
sinousaorum</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor
philoceratops</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">Passer
domesticus</span>,
- XXX), but such a clade is poorly supported, taking 37 extra steps in
Hartman et al.'s TWiG maniraptoromorph analysis for instance.<em></em></span><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Oviraptorosauria defined</span>-
The first proposed phylogenetic definition of Oviraptorosauria was
written in "A Note Added by the Editors" in Barsbold's (1997)
encyclopedia entry, so is properly cited Currie and Padian in Barsbold,
1997.&nbsp; Their definition was "Oviraptoridae and all taxa closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
than to birds" which would have included therizinosaurs in most
topologies over the following decade.&nbsp; Padian et al. (1999) noted
this was inconsistant with common usage and so proposed a node-based
definition instead- "<span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> (=<span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>) and all descendants
of their most recent common ancestor."&nbsp; However in the early 2000s
taxa like <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Incisivosaurus</span>
were consistantly recognized as related to but outside this node and
called oviraptorosaurs, so Hu et al. (2009) finally proposed a
stem-based definition excluding therizinosaurs.<br>
<b>Ex-oviraptorosaurs</b>-
A partial sacrum and ilium (SMNS 58023) described by Frey and Martill
(1995) as a possible oviraptorosaur, but was reidentified as a
megaraptoran (Aranciaga Rolando et al., 2018).<br>
A femur (ZIN PH 1/13) identified as oviraptorosaurian or ornithomimid
by Nessov (1995) is ornithomimid (Averianov et al., 2003).<br>
Currie et al. (1996) identified a surangular (NMV P186386) and dorsal
(NMV P186302) from the Eumeralla Formation of Victoria as
oviraptorosaurian, but these have been placed more ambiguously as
theropod (Agnolin et al., 2010) and maniraptoran (Benson et al., 2012)
lately.<br>
A cervical vertebra (MACN 622) discovered with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Noasaurus</span> holotype was originally
identified as an oviraptorosaur (Frankfurt and Chiappe, 1999), but
reidentified by Agnolin and Martinelli (2007) as a noasaurid, and
probably part of the holotype individual. <br>
Paul (2010) placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Sapeornis</span>
in Oviraptorosauria, but that takes 37 more steps in Hartman et al.'s
(2019) matrix so is highly unlikely.&nbsp; Paul also placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Epidexipteryx</span> there (but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Scansoriopteryx</span>), and Brusatte et
al. (2014) recovered an <span style="font-style: italic;">Epidexipteryx</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Pedopenna</span>
pair as the basalmost oviraptorosaurs.&nbsp; Cau (2018) recovered all
scansoriopterygids as oviraptorosaurs in his Bayesian analysis.&nbsp;
In a modified version of the Hartman et al. matrix, scansoriopterygids
move to Oviraptorosauria in 9 steps, but getting <span style="font-style: italic;">Epidexipteryx</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Pedopenna</span> there without <span style="font-style: italic;">Scansoriopteryx</span> takes 13 steps and
4 steps respectively.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>-
(NGMC 2125) (690 mm) incomplete skull (70 mm), mandibles, hyoid, six
cervical vertebrae (16 mm), five dorsal vertebrae (13 mm), sacrum,
fourteen caudal vertebrae, chevron, proximal scapula, partial

metatarsal IV (81 mm), phalanx IV-1, phalanx IV-2, phalanx IV-3,
phalanx IV-4, pedal ungual IV, metatarsal V, contour feathers, retrices<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Senter et al., 2004) six maxillary teeth;
seven dentary teeth. <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>-
Ji and Ji's (1997) initial diagnosis is formed entirely of
plesiomorphies (claviform and unserrated dentition; sternum is thin and
flat; tail is long; forelimb/hindlimb index is 0.7; forelimb resembles <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
in morphology with three unguals, the second of which is enlarged;
ilium is large and elongated; pubes are robust and distally fused; hind
limb is long and robust with digit I reduced and dorsally migrated;
torso feathers are 50 mm in length with short and robust shafts; tail
fan is extremely well developed; retrices are as long as 150 mm with a
slender and elongated shaft and slender and gracile barbs) and untrue
statements (proximal
metatarsals are fused; pedal digit I lies in opposition to digit III
and forms a grasping apparatus).<br>
Ji et al. (1998) also included the following characters in their
diagnosis- large straight premaxillary teeth (also in <i>Incisivosaurus</i>);
short, bulbous maxillary and dentary teeth (plesiomorphic for
Maniraptora); all of which are primitively serrated (incorrect- Senter
et al., 2004); rectrices form a fan at the end of the tail
(plesiomorphic for Pennaraptora).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1996.<br>
<b>Phylogenetic relationships</b>- Ji and Ji (1997) initially referred <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>
to Archaeopterygidae based on constricted tooth roots ("claviform"
teeth; primitive for maniraptorans) and "elongated forelimb or
primitive wing with three talons" (primitive for maniraptoriforms) and
"extremely well developed tail fan, and feather morphology" (primitive
for pennaraptorans).<br>
Zhou (1997) classified <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> as a sauriurine bird
more closely related to enantiornithines than <i>Confuciusornis</i>
due to the smaller manual ungual III, but Sauriurae is near universally
rejected and subsequent analyses have shown <span style="font-style: italic;">Confuciusornis</span> is far more similar
to enantiornithines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.<br>
Xu et al. (1999) resolved <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> as a paravian in a
trichotomy with <i>Caudipteryx</i> and Troodontidae+Eumaniraptora. Xu
et al. (2000) used 86 of the same characters plus three new ones, added
<i>Microraptor</i> and removed Tyrannosauridae and <i>Unenlagia</i>.
Their tree was slightly more resolved, as <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> was
found to be the sister taxon of Troodontidae+Eumaniraptora, and thus
closer to birds than <i>Caudipteryx</i>. However, both studies
supported the paravian status of <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>
using the same seven characters.&nbsp; Of these, three (deep suborbital
bar; unfused interdental plates; pubic foot projects posteriorly only)
are unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>,
and two others (less than 11 caudal
vertebrae with transverse processes; metacarpal I less than 33% of
metacarpal II in length) are not present in the taxon.&nbsp;
Oviraptorids and troodontids are miscoded as lacking a proximodistally
elongate coracoid, which is actually a pennaraptoran
synapomorphy.&nbsp; A radius less than 70% of ulnar width is shared
with e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> and is highly homoplasious in
basal Paraves.<br>
Xu et al. (2000) resolved <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> as a paravian more
derived than <i>Caudipteryx</i>
based on four additional characters.&nbsp; Two (teeth with serrated
mesial and distal carinae; mid and distal caudal vertebrae at least
130% longer than proximal caudals) arn't present in <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>
, while a short dorsal process of the
premaxilla cannot be determined.&nbsp; The remaining character (manus
over 120% of ulnar length) was misscored as lacking in <i>Compsognathus</i>,
ornithomimids, <i>Caudipteryx</i> and oviraptorids (ornithomimids and
oviraptorids are polymorphic), but is also a composite character
involving lengths of different manual elements.<br>
Holtz (2001) found <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> to be either a basal
member of the therizinosaur-oviraptorosaur clade, sister taxon to
Pennaraptora, or a basal paravian.<br>
Ji and Ji (2001) placed <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> as a basal avialan in
their cladogram, using the name Dromavialae for the node of <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>+Aves.
This was based on the character "real wings with symmetrical feathers
of modern concept", which is vague and also occurs in basal
pennaraptorans.<br>
Gishlick (2002) found <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> to be in a
eumaniraptoran polytomy with <i>Deinonychus</i>, <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
<i>Archaeopteryx</i> and Pygostylia, though the matrix only included
forelimb characters.<br>
Paul (2002) assigned <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> to the Archaeopterygidae
based on several characters, none of which are convincing. For
instance, the teeth are virtually identical to those of <i>Incisivosaurus</i>,
so <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>'s "small, conical teeth" are not
distinctively archaeopterygid. The sternal morphology is invalid
because <i>Archaeopteryx</i>'s supposed sternum is actually a
coracoid. Other characters such as the "slender fingers", and
"non-fused but tighly articulated metacarpals, tarsals and metatarsals"
are symplesiomorphic within maniraptorans and vague. Only one third
manual digit of <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> is crossed under digit II,
which is taphonomic instead of structural in any case. The ilium is too
incomplete to know if the preacetabular process would make it
parallelogram-shaped, while the pubis is too incomplete to measure
pelvic canal depth. I cannot confirm the coracoid is strongly bent as
in avepectorans. The robust second manual digit is shared with
caenagnathids, while the low ilium and slender pointed postacetabular
process are unquantified but also present in e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span>.<br>
Senter (2003) combined <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> and <i>Incisivosaurus</i>
into one OTU, which he found to be the basalmost oviraptorosaur. Senter
et al. (2004) came to the same conclusion.<br>
Holtz et al. (2004) recovered <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> as a paravian
more derived than alvarezsaurids, excluded from Deinonychosauria and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>+Ornithurae.<br>
Senter (2007) and Cau (2018) found <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> to be the
sister group of <i>Incisivosaurus</i>, with both of these taxa as the
most basal oviraptorosaurs.<br>
Funston and Currie (2016) added the taxon to a version of Maryanska's
oviraptorosaur matrix and found it emerged as the sistergroup of <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>, albeit with <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Herrerasaurus</span> as the only other
included non-oviraptorosaurs.<br>
Hartman et al. (2019) recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>
as the sister taxon to Pennaraptora, but after adding more taxa it is
the most basal oviraptorosaur.&nbsp; In that updated matrix it takes 13
steps to be an archaeopterygid, 34 steps to be between <span style="font-style: italic;">Confuciusornis</span> and
enantiornithines, 5 steps to be a paravian, <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from He et al., 2008) puboilial ratio of
1.46.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- In its
diagnosis, He et al. list a dagger-like pygostyle (also present in <i>Nomingia</i>
and <i>Citipati</i>), ilium shaped like <i>Caudipteryx</i>
(ambiguous), two large anterior dorsal hypapophyses (present in
caenagnathoids) and puboilial ratio of 1.46. The latter compares with
1.04-1.12 in <i>Caudipteryx</i>, .96 in <i>Nomingia</i> and .99 in <i>Microvenator</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was first mentioned by Wang et al. (2007)
as an unnamed caudipterid and later described and named by He et al.
(2008).&nbsp; Xu et al. (2010a) briefly describe two new, younger
specimens which are almost complete.<br>
He et al. referred it to Caudipteridae based on several characters.
Most are symplesiomorphic for maniraptorans (low number of caudal
vertebrae; deep pubic peduncle; unfused metatarsus; metatarsal III
longest; metatarsals II and IV subequal in width; metatarsal II
slightly shorter than IV; subarctometatarsal metatarsus), the
proximally placed metatarsal I is also present in <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>,
and the preacetabular depth is intermediate between other
oviraptorosaurs.<br>
Xu et al. (2011) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span>
to Senter's TWiG matrix and recovered it as an oviraptorosaur more
derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.&nbsp;
<br>
Lamanna et al. (2014) added this to Maryanska's oviraptorosaur matrix
and recovered it as a caudipterid.<br>
Cau (2018) recovered it as more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Incisivosaurus</span>, but less than <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>.<br>
Most recently, Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as the most basal
oviraptorosaur, but after adding several taxa <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span> moves to be the
basalmost member instead.&nbsp; <br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was purchased from a fossil dealer and
initially mentioned in an abstract by Wang and Xu (2012) before being
officially described by Wang et al. (2013). Initially the partial tibia
was thought to be a femur by Wang and Xu.&nbsp; Note the diagnosis
given by Wang et al. includes numerous symplesiomorphies and will need
to be revised.<br>
Wang and Xu found it to be a heyuannine in their unpublished analysis,
while Wang et al. found it to be most closely related to <i>Citipati</i>

<b>Comments</b>- In 2000, Zhou and Wang proposed the family
Caudipteridae for <i>Caudipteryx</i>.
Osmolska et al. (2004) emmended this to Caudipterygidae, since
Caudipteridae is formed incorrectly (ICZN Article 29.3). It has been
suggested this is unecessary, since according to Article 29.4, "if
after 1999 a new family-group name is based on a generic name which is
or ends in a Greek or Latin word or ends in a Greek or Latin suffix,
but its derivation does not follow the grammatical procedures of
Articles 29.3.1 or 29.3.2, its original spelling must be maintained as
the correct original spelling." However, Article 29.4.2 states this is
only true provided the genus was treated as an arbitrary combination of
letters (e.g. "Caudipteryxidae"), which is not the case. To complicate
matters, Article 29.5 states "If a spelling of a family-group name was
not formed in accordance with Article 29.3 but is in prevailing usage,
that spelling is to be maintained, whether or not it is the original
spelling and whether or not its derivation from the name of the type
genus is in accordance with the grammatical procedures in Articles
29.3.1 and 29.3.2."&nbsp; Caudipteridae has 6420 search results
compared to Caudipterygidae's 402 on Google, and 15 vs. 14 on Google
Scholar (as of 8-26-19). Thus Caudipteridae should be maintained.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (suggested) large premaxillary subnarial process;

posteroventral process; posterodorsal dentary process longer than
posteroventral process; no intramandibular joint; vomers do not extend
past external nares?; ectopterygoid very thin and C-shaped; twelve
cervical vertebrae?; ventral margin of coracoid irregular?; anterior
margin of preacetabular process posteroventrally oriented.<br>
<b>Comparison of specimens</b>- Five specimens of <i>Caudipteryx</i>
have been described. NGMC 97-4-A, NGMC 97-9-A and BPM 0001 are referred
to the type species, <i>C. zoui</i> (Ji et al., 1998; Zhou et al.,
2000). IVPP V 12344 was referred to a new species, <i>C. dongi</i>
(Zhou and Wang, 2000). IVPP V 12430 was referred simply to <i>C. sp.</i>
(Zhou et al., 2000). Zhou and Wang differetiated <i>C. dongi</i> from <i>C.
zoui</i> based on the smaller sternum and longer first metacarpal. Most
differences I can see between the specimens are cranial, although this
may be due to the fact the skulls are well illustrated, while the
postcrania is not. Are these differences real or preservational? A
large amount of the variety seems to be due to crushing and distortion.
For instance, there is no way the lacrimal of IVPP V 12430 could have
had such a small angle between its anterior and posterior processes in
life. Similarily, the posterior postorbital process of BPM 0001 is much
too long, as it would extend well past the quadrate when articulated.
The anterior squamosal process of that specimen is much too large and
bulbous, as it would reach through the postorbital and into the orbit.
More evidence that distortion has occured might come from the asymmetry
in specimens. The dorsal cranial elements (nasal, frontal, parietal)
are often distorted and asymmetrical. The differences least likely to
be due to distortion or individual variation support BPM 0001 and IVPP
V 12430 being separate from NGMC 97-9-A. Characters these two specimens
share not found in the latter are- premaxilla blunt anteriorly; large
premaxillary subnarial process; maxilla extended anteriorly with
promaxillary fossa; external naris close to antorbital fenestra in
length; jugal strongly concave posterodorsally; quadratojugal posterior
process not developed; posterodorsal dentary process subequal in width
to posteroventral process; posterodorsal dentary process longer than
posteroventral process; no intramandibular joint. Most of the
postcranium is not figured in sufficient detail to determine
morphological differences in specimens. The differing number of
reported cervical vertebrae might be due to misinterpretation, as Zhou
et al. state "there are estimated twelve cervical vertebrae". The
coracoid has a smoothly rounded ventral border in NGMC 97-9-A, unlike
the irregular border of BPM 0001, although the significance of this is
uncertain. The orientation of the anterior preacetabular edge differs
in IVPP V 12344 and IVPP V 12430, but as the skull of the former is
fragmentary, it cannot be determined if this is correlated with the
cranial differences noted above. Contra Zhou and Wang, no significant
differences in postcranial ratios is evident. Most ratios vary within a
few percentage points of each other, so fall within the expected range
of individual variation. The sternal plates are 24% of femoral length
in the holotype of <i>C. zoui</i>, 17% in the holotype of <i>C. dongi</i>
and an intermediate 21% in BPM 0001. A three percent difference in size
does not seem to fall outside the range of individual variation. The
first metacarpal of BPM 0001 and IVPP V 12430 is 39% of metacarpal II
length. In IVPP V 12344, the ratio is 45%. This difference might be
considered diagnostic if not for NGMC 97-4-A, which has a 42% ratio.
Although stated to be "about .4" in Zhou and Wang, this figure comes
from Ji et al., who only measured to the tenths place. The exact ratio,
as mentioned above, is intermediate between the more divergent
specimens. Once again, the 3% difference is considered insufficient to
diagnose a species. The ilium is much shorter in NGMC 97-4-A (69% of
femoral length) than in BPM 0001, IVPP V 12344 and IVPP V 12430
(77-79%). This is due to the broken anterior edge in the former
specimen however, as can be seen in the specimen (pers. obs.). The only
potentially significant proportional difference between specimens is-
manual ungual I vs. manual ungual II (106% in BPM 0001 and IVPP V
12430, 84% in IVPP 12344). Although the first manual ungual of NGMC
97-4-A is incomplete, it was much smaller than manual ungual II, so
seems to match IVPP V 12344 better. It therefore seems that BPM 0001
and IVPP V 12430 share several cranial characters not seen in NGMC
97-9-A; NGMC 97-9-A has a slightly different coracoid morphology than
BPM 0001; BPM 0001 and IVPP V 12430 have a different preacetabular
morphology than IVPP V 12344; and that BPM 0001 and IVPP V 12430 have
different manual ungual ratios than IVPP V 12344 and NGMC 97-4-A. Two
groups of specimens are suggested by these differences- IVPP V 12344,
NGMC 97-4-A and NGMC 97-9-A are one group, while BPM 0001 and IVPP V
12430 are in the other. The inclusion of IVPP V 12344 and NGMC 97-4-A
with NGMC 97-9-A is far from certain, but the fact they all differ from
the other two specimens and that the latter two have similar ungual
ratios suggests this may be the case. Are these differences due to
ontogenetic, sexual or taxonomic variation? The minute size variation
(femora vary between 145-152 mm) suggests it is not ontogenetic.
Settling whether two sexes or species are involved is not easily
resolved with only five specimens to work with, all from different
localities. One potential way to decide this would be if the groups are
not sister groups in a phylogenetic analysis.<br>
<b>Phylogenetic relationships</b>- Sereno (1999) was the first to
recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> as an
oviraptorosaur which has been the consensus since 2002, but a few other
possibilities have been proposed over the years.<br>
<b><i>Caudipteryx</i> in Avialae?</b> Ji et al. (1998) first included <i>Caudipteryx</i>
in Chiappe's bird matrix, also including alvarezsaurids and <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>,
with <i>Velociraptor</i> as an outgroup. Note this doesn't allow <i>Caudipteryx</i>
to fall outside of Eumaniraptora. Also note it was only examined with
characters that were thought to be useful for analyzing Avialae. With
these caveats in mind, Ji et al. found it to be an avialan based on two
characters- unserrated teeth; dorsal premaxillary process reaches to
anterior border of antorbital fossa. As only the premaxilla is toothed
in <i>Caudipteryx</i>, and premaxillary teeth are plesiomorphically
unserrated in maniraptoriforms (only derived dromaeosaurids and derived
troodontids have serrations; <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> was misscored as
having them), this doesn't support placing <i>Caudipteryx</i> in
Avialae instead of Oviraptorosauria. The second character is also seen
in caenagnathoids (<i>Anzu, Avimimus</i>, oviraptorids), though absent
in <i>Incisivosaurus</i>. <br>
Those who doubted the dinosaur-bird link have always said <i>Caudipteryx</i>
is a bird due to its unambiguous remiges and retrices. Originally, this
meant separating it from other non-avialan maniraptoriforms, which they
viewed as dinosaurs. Since 2002 however, as more maniraptoriforms are
discovered with remiges and retrices, workers such as Feduccia and
Martin have allowed oviraptorosaurs, dromaeosaurids, troodontids, and
possibly even alvarezsaurids and ornithomimosaurs to be birds as well
(though they still insist therizinosaurs are sauropodomorphs). Thus
their arguments for placing <i>Caudipteryx</i> as a bird (e.g. Martin
and Czerkas, 2000; Geist and Feduccia, 2000; Ruben and Jones, 2000) are
no longer valid, as they now think some taxa which lack these bird-like
characters (e.g. <i>Velociraptor</i>) are birds anyway. Similarily,
Feduccia et al. (2005) and Martin (2004) now agree <i>Caudipteryx</i>
is a basal oviraptorosaur, though their placement of oviraptorosaurs
and other maniraptorans outside of Theropoda remains incorrect.<br>
Martin and Czerkas (2000) argued <i>Caudipteryx</i> was a sauriurine
more closely related to <i>Confuciusornis</i> than to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.
It is uncertain whether they considered enantiornithines to be the
sister taxon to <i>Confuciusornis</i> or to <i>Caudipteryx</i>+<i>Confuciusornis</i>.
Of their supporting characters, a reduced fibula, reduced calcaneum,
and "evidence of pygostyle formation" are not present in <i>Caudipteryx.&nbsp;
</i>A reduced hypopubic cup is a fictional character, as no bird has a
hypopubic cup. The external mandibular fenestra and ball-shaped femoral
head are plesiomorphies only absent in a few basal paravians like <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>, but present in at
least some enantiornithines in addition to confuciusornithids. On the
other hand, the enlarged premaxilla, reduced maxilla, toothless maxilla
and dentary and shortened tail are indeed shared with <i>Confuciusornis</i>
but not <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, but are also found in
caenagnathoids.&nbsp; Martin (2004) even suggested <i>Caudipteryx</i>
and other oviraptorosaurs may be most closely related to
confuciusornithids. This is highly unparsimonious though, as
oviraptorosaurs lack numerous paravian/eumaniraptoran, avialan,
avebrevicaudan and pygostylian characters found in confuciusornithids;
basal oviraptorosaurs such as <i>Incisivosaurus</i> and <i>Caudipteryx</i>
lack most of the confuciuornithid-like characters found in derived
oviraptorosaurs; and confuciusornithids in turn lack most
oviraptoriform and oviraptorosaur characters. <br>
Lu et al. (2002) found <i>Caudipteryx</i>
to be closer to birds than <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
but basal to paraphyletic
alvarezsaurids, oviraptorids and ornithothoracines. Similar to Ji et
al.'s analysis, this was based on Chiappe's bird matrix so has the same
issues, except this time almost all alvarezsaurid characters were
excluded and Oviraptorosauria was added as an OTU though without many
characters linking <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>
to it.&nbsp; So this matrix again forces <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>, alvarezsaurids and now
oviraptorosaurs to be avialans, which is unparsimonious when
non-paravian outgroups are used.<br>
<b><i>Caudipteryx</i> in Paraves?</b> Xu et al. (1999) resolved <i>Caudipteryx</i>
as a paravian in a trichotomy with <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> and
Troodontidae+Eumaniraptora. Xu et al. (2000) used 86 of the same
characters plus three new ones, added <i>Microraptor</i> and removed
Tyrannosauridae and <i>Unenlagia</i>. Their tree was slightly more
resolved, as <i>Caudipteryx</i> was found to be outside a clade
consisting of <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> and Troodontidae+Eumaniraptora.
However, both studies supported the paravian status of <i>Caudipteryx</i>
using the same ten characters.&nbsp; Of these, a deep jugal, unfused
interdental plates, less than 11 caudal vertebrae with transverse
processes, metacarpal I less than 33% of metacarpal II in length, pubic
foot projects posteriorly only and posterior trochanter present are
misscored in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>.&nbsp;
Oviraptorids and troodontids are miscoded as lacking a proximodistally
elongate coracoid, which is actually a pennaraptoran
synapomorphy.&nbsp; Most deinonychosaurs (except <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ningyuanosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinfengopteryx</span>) and jeholornithids
have more than 25 caudal vertebrae, so the low number in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> is not a paravian
character (and is shared with e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span>).&nbsp;
A radius less than 70% of ulnar width is shared with e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
and is highly homoplasious in basal Paraves.&nbsp; However, mid and
distal chevrons dorsoventrally flattened (defined as in Hartman et al.
2019 as 'Chevrons - anteroposterior length &gt;75% of dorsoventral
depth by chevron 10') is shared with almost all paravians to the
exclusion of oviraptorosaurs.<br>
<b><i>Caudipteryx</i> outside Pennaraptora?</b> Holtz (2001) found <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> to either be sister to
a therizinosaur plus oviraptorosaur clade or a basal
pennaraptoran.&nbsp; Gishlick (2002) found <i>Caudipteryx</i> to be in
a trichotomy with therizinosaurs and Pennaraptora, but the matrix only

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>-&nbsp; Of the
listed characters in Qiu et al.'s (2019) diagnosis, none definitely
distinguish this taxon from <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.<br>
- "small pleurocoel close to the dorsal edge of the lateral surface of
the dorsal vertebral centrum", pleurocoels are also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>'s posterior
dorsals (unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>)
although their size and position are unreported.<br>
- "humerus longer than the scapula" is unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span> as only the
proximal scapula is preserved.<br>
- "proportionally long ulna (as long as humerus)" with an ulnohumeral
ratio of 101%, which is larger than ~86% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.&nbsp; This is
actually due to the longer humerus in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>,
as the femur and ulna are about the same length in each specimen.&nbsp;
One interesting possibility is that previous authors were mistaken in
identifying the proximal humerus of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>,
as the purported fragment of is indistinct and even has a hole which
could be a coracoid foramen.<br>
- "relatively small radiale [= scapholunare] angle (39°, compared to
&gt;48° in other
oviraptorosaurs with known radiale angle)" compared to 26° in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.<br>
- "extremely short metacarpal I (&lt;40% length of the metacarpal II)"
is actually 41%, compared to ~39% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.&nbsp;
<br>
- "small ligament pits on the manual phalanges" doesn't seem distinct
from some <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> (NGMC
97-9-A) in the one phalanx illustrated as preserving them (II-2), but
does seem larger in at least I-1 and III-3 of <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>.&nbsp; Qiu et
al.'s <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span> example
(their Fig. 7c) is IVPP V12430, which does have a large pit on II-2.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was described by
Qiu et al. on April 25 2019 as a new taxon
of caudipterid.&nbsp; However, this paper has no mention of ZooBank
and as of February 6 2020
"Xingtianosaurus" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.&nbsp; Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Xingtianosaurus ganqi" Qiu
et al., 2019 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically.<br>
If <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>'s
humerus has been correctly interpreted, it's much longer than
"Xingtianosaurus"',
but the altter's greater scapholunare angle and smaller manual ligament
pits
on at least two phalanges may be outside of individual variation.&nbsp;
Yet the sternal plates would certainly seem to be very different.&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>'s are a
rounded rectangle, while "Xingtianosaurus"'
are illustrated as being drop-shaped with a notch that creates
anterolateral and posterolateral processes.&nbsp; Yet the medial edge
is along a crack in the matrix, with similar texture to the sternal
bone on the other side in some areas, and the entire anterior edge is
hidden by ribs.&nbsp; Only a short section representing about a fourth
of the supposed lateral notch is exposed, and this could be
breakage.&nbsp; Indeed, with only a short curved portion of the edge
obviously visible, the whole bone could easily be one of the otherwise
missing coracoids.&nbsp; Thus definitely distinguishing the taxa may
involve the proper identification of elements beyond what published
photos allow.&nbsp; <br>
Qiu et al. (2019) used a version of Maryanska's oviraptorosaur matrix
and recovered "Xingtianosaurus" as a caudipterid.&nbsp; Adding it to
Hartman et al.'s analysis also recovers it as a caudipterid.<br>

very short maxillary process (plesiomorphic for Oviraptoriformes);
longitudinal crest on the ventral surface of the basisphenoid

fenestra shifted between the ectopterygoid and palatine as in

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This node covered
known oviraptorosaurs until Sereno (1999a) identified <span style="font-style: italic;">Caudipteryx</span>
as a basal oviraptorosaurian and proposed Oviraptoroidea as a
name.&nbsp; However, according to ICZN rules Caenagnathoidea was
implicitly named in 1940 when Sternberg erected Caenagnathidae, so it
must have priority over Oviraptoroidea which was implicitly created in
1976 by Barsbold.&nbsp; Thus (though without explanation in the text)
Sereno (1999b) next used Caenagnathoidea for this node, with its
eponymous genera implied by the families it contains in the
cladogram.&nbsp; <br>
Funston et al. (2020) noted "a well-supported (decay index 2) group of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
and Caenagnathoidea, referred to here as Edentoraptora based on the
ubiquitous absence of teeth in these animals."&nbsp; No phylogenetic
definition was provided and the group has the same content as
Caenagnathoidea in this site's topology based on Hartman et al. where <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> is a caenagnathid.&nbsp;
Forcing <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> outside
Caenagnathoidea in that matrix and thus making Edentoraptora a unique
clade takes ten additional steps.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Caenagnathoidea defined</span>-
Maryanska et al. (2002) specified the defining genera and species, but
Sereno (online 2005) tried to replace <i>Caenagnathus</i> with <i>Chirostenotes</i>.
This is a poor decision, as the taxa are not definitely synonymous. <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i> and <i>Elmisaurus elegans</i> co-occur in the same
formation, and the only reason <i>Caenagnathus</i> is synonymized with
<i>pergracilis</i> instead of <i>elegans</i> is size. Until taxonomic
problems are solved for caenagnathids, it's best to associate the
family with its eponymous species.&nbsp; Hendrickx et al. (2019) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> to the definition as an
internal specifier, but this is unneccesary and indeed whether <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> is a caenagnathoid is an
active problem in oviraptorosaur phylogeny.<br>

philoceratops</i>) (modified)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Elmisaurids were
first listed in Osmolska's (1980) Table III as carnivores of the Nemegt
Formation represented by two individuals of one taxon, but as <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
itself was still listed as "small theropod gen. et sp. nov.", the name
was unofficial.&nbsp; It is later listed as "a new family [Osmolska, <span style="font-style: italic;">in press</span>]"
with "OSMOLSKA H. (in press). - Coossified tarsometatarsi in theropod
dinosaurs and their bearing on the problem of bird origin." in the
bibliography.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Ex-caenagnathids</span>- Possible
caenagnathid material from the Yalovach Formation of Tadjikistan (Ryan,
1997) is probably based on reports of oviraptorids by Nessov (1995),
which probably belongs to therizinosaurs instead (Alifanov and
Averianov, 2006). Reported caenagnathid forelimb elements from the
Densus-Ciula Formation of Romania (Csiki and Grigorescu, 2005) have
since been referred to the paravian <i>Balaur</i> (Csiki et al., 2010).<br>

added it to Maryanska's oviraptorosaur analysis and found it resolve
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Similicaudipteryx</span>

find their shortest trees).&nbsp; Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Anonymous (1997)
reported a <i>Chirostenotes</i> metatarsal associated with <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
specimen FMNH PR2081.<br>
Buckley (2002) referred two
distal metatarsals II to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
(her <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus elegans</span>)
because of their longitudinal
ridge which would have made the posterior metatarsus surface deeply
concave as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>. However, these are the
size of large <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
specimens.&nbsp; <br>
DePalma (2010) referred material to <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <i>Caenagnathus</i>.<br>
Funston et al. (2016) figured a tiny distal metatarsal III (TMP
1996.005.0012) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos
elegans</span>, claiming well-defined cruciate ridges as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, and that the distal
articular surface was taller than wide as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>.&nbsp; However, all
verified specimens <span style="font-style: italic;">of Citipes</span>
have surfaces wider than tall as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>.&nbsp;
While this and the other three figured metatarsals (TMP 1995.403.0010,
1984.163.0036 and 1986.036.0186) have surfaces taller than wide, that
has not been shown to be taxonomically informative.&nbsp; Note while
the
figure caption states it and the other figured metatarsals are "from
the Upper Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation, Dinosaur Provincial Park,
Alberta, Canada" the TMP online catalogue shows this specimen is from
the Hell Creek Formation of Montana.&nbsp; While these metatarsi may be
<span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, the large coeval <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> has not had its distal
metatarsals described yet (though TMP 1996.005.0012 would have to be a
juvenile if referred to it).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Only specimens through 1980 have been added from the
TMP online catalogue so far.&nbsp; These are often referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
in the catalogue, but are retained as Caenagnathidae here as
differences between these geneera have been contentious and only
recently resolved.<br>
TMP 1981.019.0252 and 1992.036.0053 were referred to <i>Caenagnathus
sp.</i> by Currie (1992) and Currie et al. (1993) respectively. Sues
(1997) referred TMP 1975.011.0033 (misidentified as a caudal on the TMP
online catalog) to <i>Chirostenotes</i>, while Makovicky (1995)
referred TMP 1984.167.0044, 1989.036.0109 and 1991.036.0146 to that
genus. The latter material did not have locality information listed,
but is probably from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. TMP
1995.403.0010 is figured by Funston et al. (2016) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchus elegans</span> (now <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>), but seems too
large.&nbsp; It may be <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
or young <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
instead.&nbsp; Funston (2019) describes and figures partial ilium TMP
1998.093.0013, pubes TMP 1994.012.0603 and pubis TMP
1980.016.2095.&nbsp; The pubes differ from the larger one referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, so are believed by
Funston to be either <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>.&nbsp;
Atkins-Weltman et al. (2024) mention "an undescribed partial
tibiotarsus" with astragalocalcaneum fused to the tibia as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoneophron</span>
"possibly also from a caenagnathid, from the Dinosaur Park Formation of
Alberta (TMP 1985.065.0001; GFF pers. obs.). The latter specimen (TMP
1985.065.0001) is catalogued as an ornithomimid, but shares several
features with caenagnathids, including a semi-circular cross-section of
the shaft and the absence of a groove or ridge for the fibula (which
sits lateral to the tibia throughout its length in oviraptorosaurs, as
opposed to other theropods including ornithomimids)."<br>

distinct from other coelurosaurs known at the time, though possibly
referrable to <i>Chirostenotes</i> or Dromaeosauridae (neither of
which were then known from vertebrae). Currie et al. (1993) noted the
caudals belonged to an oviraptorosaur, referring them to <i>Caenagnathus
</i>sp.. Bell et al. (2015) described two manual unguals as cf. <i>Anzu</i>,

deeper concavity between the flexor tubercle and articular surface than
that genus.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>

<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was collected in 1933 but not described until 1970
(Ostrom, 1970).&nbsp; As noted by Ostrom, "associated with the type
specimen were 25 teeth of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
type which Barnum Brown believed belonged to this specimen."&nbsp;
"Because of the extremely large size of the associated teeth, this
specimen has been known informally in conversation by the name
"Megadontosaurus""&nbsp; As Chure and McIntosh (1989) stated, Brown
proposed "Megadontosaurus ferox" with the intended holotype AMNH 3041,
but "never got around to
describing these animals, and it was left to John Ostrom to describe
and name them many years later in 1970, based in many cases on much
better and more diagnostic material which he had collected."&nbsp;
"None of
Brown's names were ever published (until Glut 1972 [for "Peltosaurus"])
and it does no harm to mention them here, as Ostrom's names are well
established taxa having full priority. Brown's names, however, were
used in public lectures, and for a time on some exhibited specimens. In
addition, they were written on photographs and preliminary skeletal
reconstructions made under Brown's direction."&nbsp; Ostrom writes
"without excveption, the 25 associated teeth duplicate in size and form
the teeth found with the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus
antirrhopus</span>", including the high DSDI.&nbsp; He referred them to
that taxon, and noted "they are still catalogued with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span> remains under AMNH
3041."<br>
The tooth (YPM 5366) questionably referred to <i>Microvenator</i>
by Ostrom is unlikely to belong to an oviraptorosaur, as it is
plesiomorphically recurved and ziphodont, so is referred to Tetanurae
indet. here.&nbsp; The same is true of another tooth (MOR coll.)
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span> by
Maxwell (1993).&nbsp; Yun and Funston (2021) figured the first
metatarsal in detail.<br>
This genus has a controversial placement in recent analyses, from being
a caudipterid in Senter et al. (2012), avimimid in Lee et al. (2014),
sister to caenagnathoids in Brusatte et al. (2014) and Foth et al.
(2014), and basal caenagnathid in Funston and Currie (2016).&nbsp;
Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as a basal oviraptorid, but with the
addition of more taxa it moved to the first branching caenagnathid.<br>

35 degrees in dorsal view" is not true in the <span style="font-style: italic;">L. gaddisi</span> holotype.&nbsp; Indeed,
the diagnosis of <span style="font-style: italic;">L. gaddisi</span>
lists "lateral occlusal margins of the dentaries not as strongly
divergent in dorsal view, with the tip of the beak being narrower and
more spoon-shaped in dorsal view", which is true as they show an angle
of about 20 degrees.&nbsp; Both this and the "short caudal symphyseal
shelf"
fall within the range of variation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
(again compare to TMP 2001.012.0012 which has a ~20 degree angle and a
shorter symphysis than <span style="font-style: italic;">gaddisi</span>'s
holotype).&nbsp; Of the remaining two listed characters for <span style="font-style: italic;">L. gaddisi</span>, "a strongly rounded
anteroventral margin of the symphysis" is indistinguishable from some <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> (TMP 1992.036.0390)
and "a more anteriorly projecting tip of the beak" than 1992.036.0390
is true in other <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
jaws like 2001.012.0012.&nbsp; Thus all suggested characters fall
within the range of variation of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes
pergracilis</span>.&nbsp; The size is relatively small but within the
range of known juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>,
plus Funston et al. (2020) showed dentary fusion occurs even in those
juveniles, so this does not suggest "that the animal was mature" as
Longrich et al. claim.&nbsp; Intriguingly, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos</span>
holotype seems to show fibrous external bone texture (Longrich et al.'s
Fig. 8D below the label) and a poorly developed m. genioglossus
attachment, both of which Funston et al. suggested could be associated
with immaturity.&nbsp; Thus it could easily be a juvenile of a <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>-sized taxon.&nbsp; As
it cannot presently be distinguished from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> or the cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span> dentaries IGM
102/107, it is here considered an indeterminate caenagnathid.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Some of this material was first reported as
Caenagnathidae indet. by Longrich et al. (2010). While Longrich et al.
(2013a) intended to name <i>Leptorhynchos gaddisi</i>, they did not
specify a type species, making the correction Longrich et al. (2013b)
necessary to specify <i>gaddisi</i> as the type species and make the
names official.<br>
Longrich et al. (2013a) proposed this species is sister to <i>elegans</i>,
both being closer to <i>Chirostenotes</i> than to <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i>.
Their phylogenetic analysis would seem to support this, but <i>Elmisaurus
rarus</i>' basal position is due to their figure 14 being an Adams
consensus tree. Because <i>rarus</i> lacks described mandibular
material, it cannot be placed precisely compared to <i>Caenagnathasia</i>
and their <i>Caenagnathus</i> OTUs, so will have a position at the
base of the largest clade it can belong to in an Adams consensus tree.
When their analysis is rerun to a posteriori exclude taxa incomparable
to <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i>, it is in a trichotomy with <i>Chirostenotes</i>
and <i>elegans</i>. Further, their analysis miscodes <i>rarus</i> as
lacking metatarsal fusion and excludes the other five characters
suggested by Currie (1989) to unite <i>rarus</i> and <i>elegans</i>
to the exclusion of <i>pergracilis</i>.<br>
Longrich et al. do claim <i>elegans</i> is more similar to <i>Chirostenotes</i>
in one way. They state "Longrich (2008a) tentatively placed [<i>elegans</i>]
in <i>Chirostenotes</i>, because the third metatarsal has an
anteroposteriorly flattened shaft that is concave and broadly exposed
on the posterior of the metatarsus (Currie 1989). This is a derived
feature found in <i>Chirostenotes</i> (Currie and Russell 1988) but
not <i>Elmisaurus</i> (Osmólska 1981)." This seems related to their
new character 205- "Metatarsal III with an ovoid or subtriangular cross
section (0) or anteroposteriorly flattened, with a concave posterior
surface (1). Primitively in theropods the third metatarsal has an ovoid
cross section, or a triangular cross section in arctometatarsalian
forms. This condition is retained in most oviraptorosaurs, including
the basal caenagnathid <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i>. In Caenagnathinae, the
third metatarsal is anteroposteriorly compressed." Yet the posterior
transverse exposure of proximal metatarsal III proximally seems
intermediate in <i>E. rarus</i>' holotype compared to the two
specimens of <i>elegans</i>. More distally, Currie's (1989) figure 2P
section indicates the posterior exposure is narrow as in <i>E. rarus</i>.
Currie's (1989) figure 2Q shows <i>E. rarus</i> has a concave
posterior metatarsal III surface as well. As for shape, the main issue
seems to be the use of different proximodistal points along the bone.
Currie and Russell (1988) state in <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>
"The proximal end, viewed dorsally, is diamond shaped, tapering both
anteriorly (between the contact of metatarsals II and IV) and
posteriorly. Its major horizontal axis, 17.5 mm long, is
anteroposterior in orientation and thins backwards." Sternberg (1932)
also states the <i>Macrophalangia</i> holotype (possibly <i>Caenagnathus
collinsi</i> according to Longrich et al.) has a transversely
compressed proximal end. The proximal ends of <i>E. rarus</i>' and <i>elegans</i>'
metatarsal III are fused too well with surrounding bones to compare.
Once <i>C. pergracilis</i>' anterior surface is exposed, "the bone
twists until the medial surface is facing anteriorly" and "the anterior
edge has broadened out to 7.5 mm to separate the adjacent metatarsals
and is triangular in section" (Currie and Russell, 1988). <i>elegans</i>'
holotype is broken at about this same point and also shows a triangular
section. Note a triangular section is what Longrich et al. are claiming
caenagnathines don't have, though it exists in both <i>pergracilis</i>
and <i>elegans</i>. Currie (1989) was also wrong in comparing the
proximal diamond shape of <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i> with the
more distal triangular shape of <i>elegans</i>, and none of these
areas have been described in <i>E. rarus</i>. At two-thirds down in <i>Chirostenotes</i>,
"In section, a shallow concave surface faces posteriorly at this level,
while slightly concave surfaces face posteromedially and
posterolaterally for contact with the adjacent metatarsals." This
appears similar to <i>E. rarus</i> from what the anterior and
posterior views suggest, and matches how Snively (2000) described the
specimen. It also matches the cross section of <i>elegans</i>
illustrated by Currie (1989- fig. 2P). While Currie's figure 2Q of <i>Elmisaurus
rarus </i>would suggest a slightly different shape where the articular
surfaces are smaller and that for metatarsal IV doesn't angle
posteromedially, the narrow anterior exposure of metatarsal III means
it must have been taken more proximally, probably about halfway down
considering the ratio between anterior and posterior exposure of
metatarsal III. This leaves anteroposterior compression, which varies
throughout the bone in <i>elegans</i> at least. Distally it's
transversely compressed but proximally it's anteroposteriorly
compressed. The <i>E. rarus</i> section which is probably intermediate
in position is also intermediate in compression, being slightly
transversely compressed. If <i>Chirostenotes</i> specimens are any
indication, the bone switches back to transversely compressed at its
proximal tip. So there are actually no valid described differences in
metatarsal III sectional shape between <i>Chirostenotes</i> and any <i>Elmisaurus</i>
species in the primary literature.<br>
As discussed above under Other diagnoses, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos gaddisi</span>
holotype is indeterminate and possibly juvenile.&nbsp; None of the
referred
material is diagnostic, but the small and fused distal tarsal and
metatarsal IV (TMM 43057-36) are like <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>.&nbsp;
If anything, this suggests the large Aguja ungual and femur (TMM
42920-2 and UTEP B38 L-3) described by Longrich et al. might belong to
adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, while TMM 43057-36
is a separate smaller species, perhaps <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>.&nbsp;
The small caudal centrum (TMM 42335-40), distal metatarsal III (TMM
43057-354) and pedal ungual (TMM 43057-357) are here placed in
Caenagnathidae indet., as they could be juveniles, while the proximal
partial tarsometatarsus is provisionally referred to the
contemporeneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes elegans</span>.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Sullivan et
al. (2011) also listed differences from <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>
"in being 20% smaller and relatively more robust, lacking a dorsal
suture on the pubic boot, and having a significantly lower pubic
apron/pubis length ratio."&nbsp; However, all other caenagnathid pubes
are more robust than <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>'
seems to be, perhaps due to the amount of crushing in that taxon's
holotype.&nbsp; The small size difference with undescribed histology in
each specimen means little, and that "there is a trace of a suture" on
the dorsal surface of <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>'
pubis is not a strong indicator of a less mature specimen.&nbsp; The
apron/pubis ratio (supposedly 38% vs. 49%) actually refers to the
distance from the distal interpubic foramen tip to the proximomedial
corner of the apron, based on its stated length in <span style="font-style: italic;">Ojoraptorsaurus</span>.&nbsp; Yet this is
39% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>
according to Sues' figure, comparable to Anzu's 38% and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ojoraptorsaurus</span>' estimated 38% (<span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
TMP 1980.016.2095 are now known to be shorter at 33% and 30%
respectively).&nbsp; So it seems Sullivan et al. overestimated the
length in <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in summer 2002.<br>
The validity of this taxon was initially uncertain, as it was only
compared to <i>Nomingia</i> (here an oviraptorid), <i>Epichirostenotes</i>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> by Sullivan et al.
(2011) and the distribution of its diagnostic features in these taxa
and other oviraptorosaurs was poorly understood. Since then, pubes of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> have been
described.&nbsp; These show <span style="font-style: italic;">Ojoraptorsaurus</span>
to be diagnosable, although the sub-trapezoidal ilial articulation
would seem to be a symplesiomorphic difference from <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>.&nbsp; The amount
of separation of the proximomedial fossa from the acetabulum should be
determinable in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> as well, but
is currently undescribed and unfigured.<br>

no foramina on the floor of median depression posterior to first
anterior occlusal groove (unknown in other caenagnathids except <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>?, <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>).<br>
(suggested) large sacral pleurocoels (unknown in other caenagnathids
except <i>Chirostenotes</i>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>). <br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- None of the characters listed in Nessov's
(1992) diagnosis of <i>Kuszholia</i> are very characteristic.
Dorsoventrally compressed sacral centra are common in maniraptorans.
The robust second to last sacral transverse process is seen in <i>Chirostenotes</i>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span> as well.
Deep posterior sacral pleurocoels are common in caenagnathoids, and far
from being small, <i>Kuszholia</i>'s are large compared to other taxa.
The posterior articular surface is not large, being smaller than mid
sacral vertebrae, and its concavity is plesiomorphic for theropods. The
large postzygapophyses are only notable compared to birds- they are
normal for an oviraptorosaur. The sacrals of <i>Chirostenotes</i> also
have a ventral median groove which is most pronounced at the junction
of centra.<br>
Currie et al. (1993) stated there was no second anterior occlusal
groove in <i>Caenagnathasia</i>,
but Sues and Averianov (2015) reported it as present in new specimen
ZIN PH 2354/16 and showed it is present although small on the right
side of the holotype as well. Currie et al. also stated the "fluting on
the lingual margin of the occlusal edge is not as distinct in the Asian
jaws, and there are no toothlike apical projections on the ridges"
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
(including <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>),
but this is untrue for ZIN PH 2354/16.&nbsp; They said "there are no
tubercles on the midline or at the base of the first lateral occlusal
ridge", but Funston et al. (2020a) found that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
"some dentaries lack these nodules altogether (TMP 1990.056.0006; TMP
2001.012. 0012). Therefore, the presence or absence of these rugose
patches is probably best explained by individual variation."&nbsp;
Indeedd,
a tubercle is on the midline in ZIN PH 2354/16.&nbsp; <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note that while volume 30(10) of the Canadian Journal
of Earth Sciences lists its date as October 1993, it was not published
until February or March of 1994.<br>
The holotype (ZIN PO 4602) consists of the last two sacral vertebrae
and a fragment of the third to last, fused together. The centra are
dorsoventrally compressed (anterior articular surface ~66% as tall as
wide) with an oval and slightly concave posterior articular surface.
The sacrum seems to be slightly concave ventrally and the centrum
junctions are expanded both ventrally and laterally. There are small
but deep pleurocoels present in each centrum. A median ventral groove
is present, which is especially well marked at the centrum junctions.
The postzygapophyses of the last sacral protrude markedly past the
centrum. The second to last transverse process is long, robust and
perpendicular to the sacral long axis, while the last transverse
process is about half the length but otherwise similar.<br>
Nessov referred another specimen (ZIN PO 4623) consisting of the first
two fused centra of another sacrum. These are similar in being
dorsoventrally compressed (posterior articular surface ~63% as tall as
wide). The anterior articular surface is kidney-shaped and slightly
heterocoelous. It is also similar in being slightly concave, with
expanded centrum junctions and deep, oval pleurocoels in each centrum.
Ventrally, there is a slight midline groove. This was later referred to
<i>Caenagnathasia</i> by Sues and Averianov (2015). Nessov referred to
additional isolated vertebrae virtually identical to these, but 2-2.5
times larger. These may belong to larger oviraptorosaurs,
therizinosaurs or dromaeosaurids, though they are impossible to
evaluate without more information. Finally, he stated strongly
pneumatic vertebrae with closed neurocentral sutures (unlike juvenile
therizinosaurs or sauropods) could belong to <i>Kuszholia</i>. One is
illustrated (ZIN PO 4603), which is an anterior cervical with strongly
overhanging prezygapophyses, a large neural canal, an elongate centrum
(2.75 times posterior height) which reaches posteriorly past the neural
arch, and perhaps a large teardrop shaped pleurocoel. This was later
referred to <i>Caenagnathasia</i> by Sues and Averianov (2015). <br>
Nessov and Panteleev (1993) figured and described a partial sacrum they
referred to <i>Kuszholia</i> sp. (ZIN PO 4826). Zelenkov and Averianov
(2011) stated this differs from <i>Kuszholia</i> in "the absence of a
pleurocoel in the posterior vertebra and in the shallow slitlike
pleurocoel in the penultimate vertebra", and while the pleurocoel shape
appears similar, the absence of a pleurocoel in the last sacral is
indeed different. They believe the specimen to be similar to <i>Zanabazar</i>,
but I don't see any particular resemblence and refer it to Maniraptora
incertae sedis here pending further study. Nessov (1995) later figured
a centrum with a slit-like pleurocoel (ZIN PO 467) which he stated was
"possibly from bird ?<i>Kuszholia</i> sp. or from a theropod or a
segnosaur", and this was identified as a therizinosauroid by Sues and
Averianov (2016). He also figured proximal femur CCMGE 479/12457 as a
theropod before it was referred to <i>Caenagnathasia</i> by Sues and
Averianov (2015).<br>
Funston et al. (2020b) report "a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathasia martinsoni</span>
that bore teeth was allegedly collected (J. Stiegler pers. comm.), but
was lost in transit", which would be interesting as Funston et al.
(2020a) concluded "the occlusal structures in caenagnathids cannot be
homologous to alveoli, because they fail Patterson&#8217;s (1982) test of
similarity by differing in developmental and histological nature."<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- The holotype was first incorrectly listed as ZIN
PO 3486 and identified as an ichthyornithid (Nessov, 1990). Nessov
(1992) later named this as a new genus in its own family Kuszholiidae,
under "suborder Theropoda + Aves." He viewed it as possibly a basal
flightless bird like <i>Patagopteryx</i> or possibly a non-bird
theropod which was convergent with birds. Nessov and Panteleev (1993)
later assigned it to Patagopterygiformes, though their argument has yet
to be translated from Russian. Kurochkin (2001) retained <i>Kuszholia</i>
as Aves (sensu Chiappe) incertae sedis, and noted that
patagopterygiform affinities were not yet verified. He did cite two
supposed similarities though- enlarged third pair of sacral transverse
processes and ventral sacrum convex. Yet <i>Kuszholia</i>'s sacrum is
ventrally concave (as in <i>Patagopteryx</i> and many other theropods)
and the large transverse processes are on the second to last sacral. As
all theropods have at least five sacrals, this corresponds to the
fourth sacral or greater. All posterior sacral transverse processes are
broken off in <i>Patagopteryx</i> in any case. <i>Patagopteryx</i>
further differs in lacking sacral pleurocoels and having a convex
posterior articular surface, as noted by Kurochkin. Kurochkin later
(2006) placed <i>Kuszholia</i> in Euornithes (his Ornithurae), but
outside Carinatae, in his phylogram, though without stated support. <br>
The postzygapophyses of the last sacral are much larger than any
avebrevicaudan, suggesting it is not a member of that clade. As noted
above, dorsoventrally compressed centra are common in maniraptorans,
while ventral grooves are present in the posterior sacrals of <i>Ornitholestes</i>
and most maniraptoriforms. Very few maniraptorans have pleurocoels
extending to the last sacral centrum, with examples limited to <i>Neimongosaurus</i>
and caenagnathoids. Adult therizinosaurs are far larger, with even the
smallest basal members (e.g. <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>) being four times as
big, and the fusion does indicate <i>Kuszholia</i>'s holotype is from
an adult. There are small caenagnathoids though, including <i>Caenagnathasia</i>
from the same formation. In fact, <i>Caenagnathasia</i> would have
comparably sized sacrals to <i>Kuszholia</i> if scaled from other
caenagnathoids. Note Sues and Averianov (2015) assigned the <i>Kuszholia</i>
paratype and referred cervical to <i>Caenagnathasia</i> without
commenting on why the holotype was also not referrable. Indeed, there
seems to be no reason to refer any of the Bissekty caenagnathoid
material to one genus instead of the other as the type synsacrum of <i>Kuszholia</i>
cannot be compared to the type dentaries of <i>Caenagnathasia</i>. If
they are synonymous, <i>Kuszholia</i> would have priority by two
years, which is awkward as its synsacrum is less diagnostic and less
phylogenetically determinable than <i>Caenagnathasia</i>'s dentaries.
The alternative is listing all material except the three dentaries and <i>Kuszholia</i>'s
holotype as Caenagnathoidea/idae indet., but tentative synonymization
is chosen here. <br>
The holotype is generally similar to <i>Chirostenotes</i>, but differs
in having much larger pleurocoels and narrower postzygapophyses. It
also has larger pleurocoels than <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> and <i>Shixinggia</i>.
<i>Avimimus</i>
is unique among oviraptorosaurs in lacking sacral pleurocoels, so is
quite different.&nbsp; Funston and Currie (2016) found the composite
OTU
(not including the <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuszholia</span>
holotype) to be an elmisaurine caenagnathid between <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>.&nbsp; Adding taxa to
Hartman et al.'s matrix recovers the <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenanagathasia</span>
dentaries in <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>, but
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Kuszholia</span> composite in
Elmisaurinae as derived as <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
but outside <span style="font-style: italic;">Shixinggia</span>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
This was discovered in 2012 at "a rare microvertebrate locality within
the Iren Dabasu Formation, about 16 km northeast of Erenhot City",
which would put it in localities Q-T of Xing et al. (2012).&nbsp; Yao
et al. (2015) referred IVPP V20377 to <i>Caenagnathasia</i>
sp., and it does possess all characters here listed as diagnostic for
that taxon.&nbsp; Of their characters listed as varying between <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathasia</span> specimens, most also
vary between <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
specimens (posterior surface of symphysis with tubercle; chin-like
eminence between anterior and ventral surfaces; pneumatic foramen in
front of mandibular fenestra on lateral surface of dentary; depression
on posteroventral margin of symphysis [ontogenetic?]), while paired
second anterior occlusal grooves flanking first anterior occlusal
groove is polymorphic in the holotype, and lateral projections on
lingual ridges may be absent in ZIN PH 2354/16 due to
preservation.&nbsp;
This leaves presence of a median symphyseal groove on the posterodorsal
depression in the holotype and IVPP V20377 but not ZIN PH 2354/16
(ontogenetic?) and on the posteroventral symphysis of IVPP V20377 but
not the holotype or ZIN PH 2354/16 (taxonomic?).&nbsp; The age
difference
suggests the specimen is not conspecific with the Bissekty species.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Currie et al. (1993) described a posterior mandible
(their BHM 2033) which was larger than any Dinosaur Park <i>Caenagnathus</i>
and differed from <i>C. collinsi</i> and <i>C. sternbergi</i> in
glenoid morphology. They referred it to <i>Caenagnathus</i> sp..
Varricchio (2001) further noted it shared several characters with <i>C.
collinsi</i> to the exclusion of <i>C. sternbergi</i>, and Lamanna et
al. (2014) referred it to the present species.<br>
Triebold et al. (2000) reported two new large oviraptorosaur specimens
discovered in 1998, identifying them as oviraptorids, though they were
quickly reidentified as caenagnathid. These specimens were officially
described by Lamanna et al. (2014) as the new taxon <i>Anzu wyliei</i>.
The mandible is most similar to the <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i>
holotype.<br>
Schachner et al. (2006; 2007) announced MRF 318 as <i>Chirostenotes</i>
sp., which was later described as a specimen of <i>Anzu</i> by Lamanna
et al. (2011; 2014).<br>
Holtz et al. (2014, 2015) announced a new specimen (BMRP 2013.4.1-
Holtz pers. comm, 2015) found in June 2013, which has only distal
tarsal IV fused to the metatarsus, unfused metatarsals, and "a pair of
pronounced cruciate ridges on the plantar surface of metatarsal III"
which don't extend proximally as far as <i>Elmisaurus</i>.<br>
ROM 65884 was found in 2012, and unfortunately a "nearly complete right
foot was also collected, assembled into a display mount, and sold to a
private collector" before the ROM bought the rest of the material
(Cullen et al., 2020).&nbsp; Initially reported in an SVP abstract by
Benner et al. (2016) as "a large-bodied taxon similar in size to the
recently described, coeval taxon <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu
wyliei</span>", Cullen et al. described the specimen as
cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu wyliei</span>, as it is
from the same formation and almost identical in anatomy and size ("c.
3% difference in linear size, on average").&nbsp; Indeed, the slightly
curved metatarsal V is shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> or seemingly <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span> (+ <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>?).&nbsp;
While this specimen was found in the same state as BMRP 2013.4.1 and
preserves almost the same elements, they were discovered in different
years and different counties and both metatarsi of BMRP 2013.4.1 were
recovered by the Burpee Museum.<br>
Yun and Funston (2021) figure the metatarsal I of the holotype in
detail, as well as an additional <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
metatarsal I called "BDM
uncatalogued specimen," for which no other information is available in
the literature.<br>
Funston and Currie (2016) recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
as basal to the caenagnathine-elmisaurine split, sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Being the
first described caenagnathid mandible and without relationships with <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
being recognized for 36 more years, Sternberg's (1940) initial
diagnosis included mostly characters plesiomorphic for caenagnathoids
(no teeth; symphysis relatively broad; mandibular rami parallel;
external mandibular fenestra large; articular surface large, oval and
convex, with a ridged axis parallel to the direction of the ramus) and
caenagnathids (dentaries fused at symphysis).&nbsp; The final character
(retroarticular, and lateral and medial articular processes short) is
relative to Aves and true of most Mesozoic theropods.<br>
Funston et al. (2015) also listed "the anterior projection of the facet
for metatarsal IV on the proximal end" of metatarsal II as being
different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>,
but this is comparable to TMP 1979.020.001.&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- <i>Caenagnathus
collinsi</i>
was named for a pair of mandibles found in Summer 1936, and assigned to
Aves (Sternberg, 1940). This assignment was rejected by most
paleornithologists such as Wetmore (1960), who hypothesized a
relationship with ornithomimids. However, Cracraft (1971) supported an
avian relationship, specifically with Galloanseres.&nbsp; In the same
paper he named a new species of <i>Caenagnathus</i>, <i>C. sternbergi</i>,
known from a posterior mandible. This differs from <i>C. collinsi</i>
in a few characters, suggesting early that two species were present in
the Dinosaur Park Formation.&nbsp; Currie et al. (1993) later described
five dentaries which also differ from <i>C. collinsi</i>. They
referred to these as <i>Caenagnathus cf. sternbergi</i>, as none were
directly comparable to the <i>C. sternbergi</i>
holotype.&nbsp; A mandible discovered in 2001 (TMP 2001.012.0012) and
described by Funston and Currie (2014) eventually verified Currie et
al.'s dentaries went with <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span>
articulars.&nbsp; <i>Caenagnathus</i>' identity was finally solved by
Osmolska (1976), who allied it with oviraptorids. Currie and Russell
(1988) first suggested <i>Caenagnathus</i> and <i>Chirostenotes</i>
(then only known from postcrania) were synonymous, which was
strengthened by Sues' (1994) Horseshoe Canyon specimen with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>-like postcrania and
an edentulous maxilla and shown to be true at the family level by <i>Anzu</i>
(Lamanna et al., 2011) which preserved skeletons with <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>-like mandibles.&nbsp;
Longrich et al. (2013) separated <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i> from <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i> based on differences between the type mandible of the
former and <i>sternbergi</i>, which they synonymize with <i>pergracilis</i>
(as partial skeleton UALVP 59400 later confirmed).&nbsp; They referred
manual ungual CMN 12372 ("erroneously reported as CMN 12322 by those
authors" as stated by Bell et al., 2015) based on "its large size and
robust construction."&nbsp; Bell et al. (2015) described two additional
manual unguals (TMP 1993.036.0475 and 2009.003.0029), noting <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> "based on size alone
poses a conceivable match for the Dinosaur Park unguals described
here."&nbsp; Funston et al. (2015) agreed <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i>
is distinct from <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>, describing several
new specimens as <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
(TMP 79.14.1, 82.19.222, 86.36.323, 93.36.197, 93.36.198, 93.36.631,
93.75.49 and UALVP 55725).&nbsp; Funston (2020) later considered
referral of femora (especially
TMP 1986.036.0323) to be more ambiguous due to his histological
analyses of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
indicating it may have grown larger than previously expected.&nbsp;
Funston also redescribed the holotype mandible and referred a large
ilium (UALVP 59791) and pubis (UALVP 56638), the former of which is
lower than <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> and has a derived pubic
contact not present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>.&nbsp;
The ilium and pubis are described in detail and figured in Funston's
(2019) thesis, where he notes regarding UALVP 56638 "no locality data
accompanies the specimen because it was mislabelled, but the excellent
preservation and associated matrix are consistent with the DPF."&nbsp;
Of the new UALVP specimens, 55725 was found on May 31 2014, 59791 May
27 2018 and 59921 July 8 2019 (UALVP online).<br>
Sternberg (1932) described <i>Macrophalangia canadensis</i> based on a
pes found in 1928, then thought to be an ornithomimid. Colbert and
Russell (1969) noted it may be synonymous with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, though this was not
shown to be likely until Osmolska (1981) described <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> which preserved a manus
and pes of similar morphology.&nbsp; Longrich et al. (2013) proposed <i>Macrophalangia</i>
was synonymous with <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i> based on size and
robusticity compared to <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>,
which they viewed as a separate taxon. Similar or greater differences
in size and robusticity are known for other coelurosaur species so this
is not very convincing evidence.&nbsp; Funston (2020) referred <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span> to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, but noted it
differed from
TMP 1979.020.0001 in having a less constricted metatarsal I (waist 95%
of proximal depth vs. 76%), pedal
phalanx I-1 longer than metatarsal I (123% vs. 94%) and a straight
metatarsal V
(unillustrated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span>
but described as a "small round splint").&nbsp; The former two
characters were said to be
shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>, but while
phalanx I-1 length (133%) is even greater than <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span>,
metatarsal I constriction (82%) and metatarsal V curvature are both
intermediate in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>.&nbsp;
Funston (pers. comm. 2015) noted the metatarsals of <i>Macrophalangia</i>
are lost, having gone on loan and never being returned.&nbsp; It is
here provisionally referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
but as in Longrich et al. is not officially considered a senior synonym
pending more information (e.g. histology of CMN 8538).<br>
Currie (1992) reported "an isolated ungual from the Judith River
Formation of Alberta [that] is unusual in that the flexor tubercle is
well developed and extends posteriorly below the articulation with the
penultimate phalanx. The only Cretaceous animal that I am aware of with
this unusual articulation is <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>
(Perle, 1981)."&nbsp; This last reference is actually for <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>, whose pedal unguals
match this description, while the manual unguals of <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>
are unfigured and its preserved pedal ungual is only figured in dorsal
view.&nbsp; TMP 1979.015.0001 was figured as "possible segnosaurid
ungual."&nbsp; Cullen et al. (2020) found this specimen "to be most
similar in morphology to caenagnathids", which was predicted by Currie
in the initial 1992 publication, where he wrote "the ungual resembles
the manual ungual of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
if the articulation is ignored, and it is possible that the distinctive
nature of the articulation may have been produced by disease or
injury."&nbsp; Given the presence of three Dinosaur Park caenagnathids,
I refer TMP 1979.015.0001 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
based on its large size.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Sullivan et

with <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> and unknown in
other caenagnathids.&nbsp; Similarly, "otic region with deep, but
anteroposteriorly narrow, lateral depression" has not been evalauated
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>, and is not preserved
in other taxa.&nbsp; "Synsacrum composed of six co-ossified vertebrae

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- ROM 43250 was
discovered on June 12 1923 and identified as an ornithomimid. Russell
(1972) listed it as an undetermined ornithomimid, though Sues (1994)
correctly identified it as caenagnathid in an SVP abstract before
describing it in detail (Sues, 1997).&nbsp; Sullivan et al. (2011)
proposed
the name <i>Epichirostenotes curriei</i>
for ROM 43250, based on stratigraphy and several ischial differences
from TMP 1979.020.0001.&nbsp; These ischial characters may prove to be
diagnostic (in particular, the more abrupt tapering is present in two <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> specimens), but they
are comparable to interspecific variation in <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>
specimens (AMNH 5027, CM 9380 and FMNH PR2081) so could prove to be
questionable as more specimens are discovered.&nbsp; It is largely
incomparable to the similarly sized <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>,
although the pubic shaft is much more slender in side view.&nbsp; This
may
be due to the extensive taphonomic crushing described by Sues (1997)
however.&nbsp; <br>
CMN 9570 was discovered in 1926 and "was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span> in the records of
the National Museum of Natural Sciences (Ottawa) by Wann Langston, Jr."
before being described as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span>
by Russell (1984).&nbsp; Currie and Russell (1988) illustrated it and
referred the element to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
sp..&nbsp; Two caenagnathid taxa have since been identified from the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation- <span style="font-style: italic;">Apatoraptor</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>, both
based on partial skeletons lacking metatarsi.&nbsp; Funston (2019)
tentaively refers it to the latter based on size.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Differences
between palatines in this and <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>
(longer anteroventral process, anterodorsal process less upturned)
noted by Funston and Currie (2016) may be due to incompletely preserved
edges in both.&nbsp; They stated "the dentary-surangular suture does
not
extend posteriorly to the coronoid process", supposedly unlike other
caenagnathids, but this is true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
as well.&nbsp; Funston and Currie also said that "the laminae
connecting the
neural spine to the transverse processes of C6 and C7 are not as well
developed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Apatoraptor</span> as
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>,
especially in their posterior extent", but it is uncertain which
laminae these would be since oviraptorosaurs lack cervical
spinodiapophyseal laminae.&nbsp; Funston and Currie list "ventral
flange of
angular underlying posteroventral dentary process", but this seems true
in other caenagnathids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> TMP 20010.012.0012)
with its seeming absence in the one preserved side of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> being due to a
dorsally displaced angular.&nbsp; They also list "medial fossa anterior
to articular region of mandible" which is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, and unknown in other
caenagnathids (unreported but possible to check in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>).&nbsp; The lack of rib fusion
in the third cervical unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>
(and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>) could be
ontogenetic based on size.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Funston (2014) comments on TMP 1993.051.0001, a
specimen discovered in 1993 and first believed to be ornithomimid. It
is listed in Funston et al. (2015) as "unnamed taxon", is said to be
from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation by Eberth et al. (2013) and
tentatively assigned to <i>Epichirostenotes</i> there. Currie et al.
(2016) incorrectly state it's from the Dinosaur Park Formation however,
when commenting on its scapulocoracoid and humerus. The specimen was
officially named and described by Funston and Currie (2016), recovered
as closer to <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i> than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, <i>Caenagnathasia</i>or
any of the larger caenagnathids.&nbsp; Funston's (2019) description in
his thesis includes CT scans not available in the published
version.&nbsp; Simon and Evans (2021) via histological study found the
specimen is a young subadult and proposed it may be a young <span style="font-style: italic;">Epichirostenotes</span>,
which is based on a larger specimen from the same formation.&nbsp; This
would make the proposed cervical differences either ontogenetic or
individual variation.<br>

ginglymoid metacarpals I and II, less medially divergent digit I,
longer phalanx II-1, and more curved unguals.&nbsp; The shorter
metacarpal I, and deeply ginglymoid metacarpals I and II also diagnosed
to compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>.&nbsp;
The supposedly different deeply ginglymoid metacarpal III and short
phalanges of digit III in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
are due to mistaking its metatarsal II and pedal phalanges.&nbsp; It
differs from <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
(including <span style="font-style: italic;">Tanycolagreus</span>
manus AMNH 587) in the longer metacarpal and phalanx I-1, and more
divergent I-1. <br>
Cracraft (1971) included the following character in his diagnosis
compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus collinsi</span>'s
holotype, but this does not seem true of e.g. TMP 2001.012.0012-
"portion of ramus immediately anterior to articular region much less
robust and apparently relatively thinner dorsoventrally."<br>
Almost all of Currie and Russell's (1988) characters are now known to
be typical of caenagnathids, and often caenagnathoids in general- six
sacral vertebrae with pleurocoels; digit III of manus longer than
digit I, but with slender phalanges, having a diameter of less than
half that of phalanges in other digits; well-developed posterodorsal
lip on manual unguals; dolichoiliac, propubic pelvis; preacetabular
portion of iliac blade longer than postacetabular; metatarsal III is
proximally pinched between metatarsals II and IV, but only the proximal
tip is excluded from the anterior surface of the metatarsus.&nbsp;
Their
final character, tarsometatarsus may have fused in old individuals, is
currently considered false.<br>
Currie (1989) proposed that in <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes
elegans</span> the "preserved portion of metatarsal III is triangular
in section, in contrast with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes
pergracilis</span>, where it is diamond shaped", but these were being
measured at different places along the shaft (see comments under <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos</span>).&nbsp; He also
proposed a short metatarsal II differed from <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>, but <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span> specimens TMP 1982.016.0006
and TMP 2000.012.0008 have short metatarsals II as well (89% of mtIII)
(as do <span style="font-style: italic;">Kol</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span>, the latter of which
Currie viewed as synonymous with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>).&nbsp;
<br>
Following the identification of dentaries used here, Longrich et al.'s '<span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchus elegans</span>' examples are
actually <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes pergracilis</span>.&nbsp;
As such, the anteriorly projecting beak tip in some specimens is
individual or taphonomic variation, as is the varience of posterior
divergence between dentaries (~30-35 degrees), and the symphyseal
length/width ratio (49-87% vs. 58% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
and 128% in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>),
although the divergence and symphyseal width are still different from <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>.&nbsp;
Contrary to Longrich et al., the dentary is not excluded from the
dorsal margin of the external mandibular fenestra by the surangular
(TMP 2001.012.0012, 1990.056.0006), instead being similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> with a small dorsal
border.&nbsp; The beak tip can also be as elongate as <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
(e.g. UALVP 59400, TMP 1990.056.0006).&nbsp; Finally, the manual
phalanges are not extremely long and slender compared to the one known
specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> (I-1
UALVP 59921).<br>
Varricchio (2001) listed chorda tympani foramen/slot absent as
diagnostic of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus sternbergi</span>
compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">C. collinsi</span>,
which Currie et al. (1993) had restoted CMN 8776 with.&nbsp; However,
the feature is just an irregular transverse crack on each side at the
posterior base of the glenoid (photo courtesy of McFeeters) instead of
the anteroposterior groove on the dorsal glenoid surface which Currie
et al. illustrated in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span>
specimen BHM 2033.<br>
Funston (2020) included dentary fusion as a character, but this is true
of all caenagnathids.&nbsp; A deep lateral dentary fossa is only
present in TMP 2001.012.0012.&nbsp; Funston also listed cervical
vertebrae with low neural spines and small epipophyses as diagnostic,
but this is true for all oviraptorosaurs. Distal caudal vertebrae with
anteriorly directed transverse processes are also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Nomingia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipati</span>, with the condition in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> (the only other caenagnathid
to preserve the area) unreported.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i> was named in 1924
based on two manus collected in 1914, and thought by Gilmore to be a a
coelurid intermediate between <i>Ornitholestes</i> and ornithomimids.
He also referred a pair of toothed dentaries to the taxon, which Currie
et al. (1990) made the holotype of <i>Richardoestesia</i>. Holtz (DML,
1998) noted the holotype is labeled "Steneodactylus pergracilis" in the
CMN's collection, showing that was an earlier proposed name for the
taxon. This has not been published in the literature however. Sternberg
later (1932) described <i>Macrophalangia canadensis</i> based on a pes
from the same formation found in 1928, then thought to be an
ornithomimid. Colbert and Russell (1969) noted the two forms may be
synonymous, though this was not shown to be likely until Osmolska
(1981) described <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
which preserved a manus and pes of similar morphology. An alternative
hypothesis, the synonymy of <i>Chirostenotes</i> with <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
was suggested by Ostrom (1969; 1990), but is clearly incorrect given <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>' preserved metacarpal
I and the recently described partial skeleton UALVP 59400.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span> is here
provisionally referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus
collinsi</span>, as in Longrich et al. (2013).<br>
Currie and Russell (1988) first suggested <i>Chirostenotes</i> was
synonymous with the oviraptorosaurian mandible <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, which was
strengthened by Sues' (1994) Horseshoe Canyon specimen with <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>-like postcrania and
an edentulous maxilla and shown to be true at the family level by <i>Anzu</i>
(Lamanna et al., 2011) which preserved skeletons with <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>-like mandibles. As
noted above, Longrich et al. (2013) separate <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i>
from <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i> based on differences between the
type mandible of the former and <i>Caenagnathus sternbergi</i>, which
they synonymized with <i>pergracilis</i> (as partial skeleton UALVP
59400 later confirmed).&nbsp; Cracraft (1971) named <i>Caenagnathus</i>
<i> sternbergi</i>, known from a posterior mandible that differs from <i>C.
collinsi</i> in a few characters. Currie et al. (1993) later described
five dentaries which also differ from <i>C. collinsi</i>. They
referred to these as <i>Caenagnathus cf. sternbergi</i>, as none are
directly comparable to the <i>C. sternbergi</i> holotype. Currie
(2005) illustrated a new mandible (TMP 2001.012.0012) which confirms
Currie et al. were correct to refer the dentaries to <i>C. sternbergi</i>.&nbsp;
This was described in detail by Funston and Currie (2014a).&nbsp;
Longrich et al. referred TMP 1990.056.0006 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, but 1979.008.0622,
1991.144.0001 and 1992.036.0390 to their <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos elegans</span>.&nbsp;
Funston et al. (2019) reported histological work on dentaries which
showed small cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos
elegans</span> UALVP 55639 was older than larger <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> TMP
1985.043.0070 and 1992.036.1237. &nbsp; They further referred TMP
1992.040.0044 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>,
but Funston (2020) later placed this as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
instead.&nbsp; As UALVP 55639 with a 22.1 mm symphyseal length is
completely remodeled and thus quite old, I have tentatively reassigned
all larger dentaries (including TMP 1991.144.0001, 1992.036.0390 and
1992.040.0044) to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
and smaller TMP 1979.008.0622 to Caenagnathidae indet. pending
histological examination of each specimen.&nbsp; This is supported by
Funston et al. reporting that fibrous external bone texture is present
in histologically juvenile TMP 1985.043.0070 and also 1992.036.0390 and
1992.040.0044.&nbsp; Notably, the <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span>
holotype matches <span style="font-style: italic;">pergracilis</span>
TMP 2001.012.0012 in size, whereas it would be much smaller if it was a
synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>.<br>
TMP 1979.020.0001 was discovered in 1979 and described by Currie and
Russell in 1988 as <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>.&nbsp; They
distinguished between two kinds of metatarsus (robust CMN 8538; gracile
ROM 781 and TMP 1979.020.0001), tentatively believing them to be sexual
morphs.&nbsp; Ironically, Currie and Russell had mentioned TMP
1982.039.0004 as an American <i>Elmisaurus</i> specimen although they
did not yet refer the <i>elegans</i> holotype to that
genus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currie (1989) expanded on the separation, referring
some specimens to small and fused <i>Elmisaurus elegans</i> (ROM 781,
37163 and TMP 1982.039.0004) and others to large and unfused <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i> (CMN 8538 and 9570, and TMP 1979.020.0001).&nbsp;
Currie and Russell had proposed <i>Caenagnathus sternbergi</i>
belonged to the <i>elegans</i>
morph, but this was eventually disproven by Funston and Currie (2021)
who described UALVP 59400, a partial skeleton combining a <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span>-type mandible with a
histologically adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>-type
tarsometatarsus.&nbsp; Currie and Russell had referred TMP
1979.020.0001 to their <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
morph based on the slender third manual digit and gracile pes. They
note the minimum width of manual phalanx III-3 is 10% of its length,
compared to 11% in the <i>Chirostenotes</i> holotype and 10% in the <i>Elmisaurus</i>
holotype. Sues (1997) followed this referral, but believed the gracile
morph to only be a separate species, which he called <i>Chirostenotes
elegans</i>. Currie and Russell described several characters consistant
with TMP 1979.020.0001 being <span style="font-style: italic;">pergracilis</span>
instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>-
unfused tarsometatarsus; metatarsals II and IV much shorter than III
(87 and 90% respectively); proximal end of metatarsal III
diamond-shaped. These characters are more numerous and observable in
more specimens than the 1% difference in phalangeal width, while the
gracile pes may be due to the small size of TMP 1979.020.0001 compared
to CMN 8538. Sullivan et al. (2011) questioned the referral of TMP
1979.020.0001 to <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>, based on "some
minor morphological differences, including a broader curvature of
unguals I and II, a deeper ungual (measured from the dorsal and plantar
extremity of the articular facet as per Senter, 2007), and a shorter
phalanx III-3." Yet such differences are common within theropod species
known from multiple specimens. Thus TMP 1979.020.0001 is assigned to <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i>
here, as it has been by other more recent authors.&nbsp; A potential
complication was described by Simon and Evans (2021) who used histology
to determine TMP 1979.020.0001 was a juvenile with two LAGS, despite
being slightly larger than the histologically adult UALVP 59400.&nbsp;
They suggested the former may be a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> instead, but if this
is true it could also be the case for the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
holotype which has never been examined histologically, and could thus
raise significant taxonomic issues.&nbsp; Currie and Russell referred
manual ungual II TMP 1979.014.0499 to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>,
but it has not been described or figured.&nbsp; The size is identical
to TMP 1979.020.0001 so it is tentatively retained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> here, although this
would also make sense for a young <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>.&nbsp;
Notably, differences between manual ungual II in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> have since been
discovered, so it should be possible to assign TMP 1979.014.0499
eventually.<br>
Funston (2020) redescribed the holotype and TMP 1979.020.0001.&nbsp;
Note that for the latter specimen, Funston lists manual ungual I as III
in Table 2 and recognized distal tarsals Currie and Russel had not
commented on.&nbsp; A phalanx III-3 and ungual III had been lost from
the holotype, and manual phalanx III-1 from TMP 1979.020.0001.&nbsp;
Funston described anterior dentaries TMP 1996.012.0142 as
Caenagnathidae indet., but gievn their large size and distinction from <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span> (short symphysis,
upturned dentary tip), they are referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> here.&nbsp; The
partial skeleton UALVP 59400 was found on June 23 2016 and described as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes pergracilis</span>
by Funston and Currie (2021).&nbsp; Note their Figure 3 has the
articulated cervical vertebrae identified as 4, 5 and 6 but the text
and Table 1 place them as 7,8 and 9.&nbsp; It is notable for combining
mandibular and pedal material in the Dinosaur Park Formation, showing
the <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span> mandible type
is associated with the tarsal morphology of <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span>.&nbsp; <br>
Varricchio (2001) described MOR 1107, an articular from the Two
Medicine Formation, as <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus
sternbergi</span>.&nbsp; The specimen does have <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span>'s articular characters
as diagnosed by Cracraft, so is here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes pergracilis</span> which it
is contemporaneous with.&nbsp; While <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
does not preserve articular material, comparison with complete <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> mandible TMP
2001.012.0012 shows MOR 1107 is comparable in size and much larger than
<span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>.<br>

referred a pes (MOR 752) to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus
elegans</span> (now <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>).&nbsp;
This was based on lacking the long phalanges of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, being more slender
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>,
and possessing "a small but distinct anterolateral process just
proximal to the distal articulation" of metatarsal II.&nbsp; The latter
two
characters have proven to not separate the taxa once more specimens of
each were recovered (see Other diagnoses under <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>).&nbsp; However the
dorsoventral expansion of distal condyles on pedal phalanges and short
phalanx III-2 are similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus
rarus</span> (ZPAL MgD-I/98) instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes elegans</span>
(TMP 2000.012.0008), and indeed the shapes of phalanges II-1, III-1 and
III-2 are nearly identical.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2016) provisionally
retained it in <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>,
although they noted that <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
specimen TMP 2000.012.0008 lacks a phalanx III-3 that is longer than
III-2 as seen in MOR 752.&nbsp; This is also unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>, but intriguely present
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Macrophalangia</span> (= <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>?).&nbsp; Atkins-Welman
et al. (2024) suggested MOR 752 "may be more<br>
likely" to be a distinct taxon from the larger <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoneophron</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anzu</span> based on the anterior process
on metatarsal II (inferred to be absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoneophron</span>
based on the lack of a process on its metatarsal IV), which would be
expected to be better developed in older individuals.&nbsp; As noted
however
this process is individually variable in <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, absent in the relatively
large TMP 2000.012.0008, so MOR 752 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eoneophron</span>
cannot be directly compared. Both are from the same formation and
differ from <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, so could very well belong
to the
same taxon but more complete remains will be necessary to confirm this.<br>

the death of this individual occurred during its sixth year of life.

merges with the surface in each bone examined, death probably occurred
shortly after this individual emerged from its annual growth
hiatus."&nbsp; Furthermore, "the zones between the closely spaced
outermost LAGs in metatarsal IV ... remain vascularized with high
osteocyte lacuna density, suggesting that this larger metatarsal was
approaching asymptotic size but was still growing in length at death."<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Osmolska (1981) listed proximolateral process
on metatarsal IV as diagnostic at genus level, but it is also present
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes, Eoneophron</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> and has not been
shown to be absent in any caenagnathid.<br>
Currie (1989) stated metatarsal II is subequal in length to III
(&gt;93%) in both <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> (his <span style="font-style: italic;">E. elegans</span>), but this is not true
in some <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> specimens (II
is 89% in TMP 1982.016.0006 and TMP 2000.012.0008) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> shows this as well
(93%).&nbsp; Similarly, IV being close to III in length is true of all
caenagnathids where known (<span style="font-style: italic;">Eoneophron,
Elmisaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Kol</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>) except <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>.&nbsp;
Metatarsal II curving anterodistally is present in all
caenagnathids.&nbsp; While Currie stated the proximal end of metatarsal
III is triangular in <i>Elmisaurus</i>, unlike <i>Chirostenotes</i>,
the latter does have a triangular section at some points. The only
differences in cross sectional shape between caenagnathid taxa in the
literature is due to proximodistal position along the metatarsal (see
detailed discussion under <i>Leptorhynchos</i> comments). <br>
Currie et al. (2016) listed the "large, compound proximal protuberance
on the posterior surfaces of metatarsals II-IV" as being diagnostic for
elmisaurines including <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>, but this is
present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>
(based on mtII) and <i>Chirostenotes</i> as well. They also proposed
better development of m. tibialis cranialis tubercles on the dorsal
surface of metatarsals II-IV differed from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, but while these are
present in the proximal middle section of II-IV <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>' and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>' holotypes, variation
exists in other specimens.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
IGM 102/6 has them on III and IV but not II, <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> IGM 102/7 lacks them on
II and IV at least, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
TMP 2000.012.0008 lacks them on III and IV at least.&nbsp; Confusingly,
Currie et al. also refer to scars on the distal ends of metarsals as
being these insertions (e.g. Figure 9A1), which is the only place
Funston et al. (2016) describe them as being.&nbsp; Such distal scars
must be very faint however, since they were not illustrated in either
holotype and are not obvious in most photos either.&nbsp; Due to this,
they are not used in diagnoses here.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Osmolska (1981) listed several supposedly
diagnostic characters- digit III markedly thinner than digits I and II
both of which are equally thick (untrue as digit I is more gracile than
II, and conditions are the same in other caenagnathids);
ventroposterior portions of manual phalanges distinctly thickened at
proximal surfaces (also in other caenagnathids); metatarsal III visible
anteriorly for ~90% of its length (also in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> holotype, but not in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> IGM 102/7).<br>
Currie et al. (2016) stated at least manual unguals I and II of <i>Elmisaurus</i>
(III is unknown) were more robust and curved than <i>Chirostenotes</i>,
with lower proximodorsal lips, but they are comparable to ungual I of <span style="font-style: italic;">Caenagnathus</span>, <i>Hagryphus</i> and
<span style="font-style: italic;">Apatoraptor</span> (II unknown except
for <span style="font-style: italic;">Apatoraptor</span>).<br>
(suggested) ventral edge of ischium convex distal to obturator process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1970, listed as "small theropod gen. et
sp. nov." by Osmolska (1980) and described in 1981, <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i>
was the first caenagnathid discovered with both manual and pedal
remains. This allowed the synonymy between <i>Chirostenotes</i> and <i>Macrophalangia</i>
to be demonstrated. <i>Elmisaurus</i> has been viewed as a relative of
<i>Chirostenotes</i> (first in Elmisauridae and later in
Caenagnathidae) from its discovery until the 2000s, when this was
questioned by Maryanska et al. (2002). They noted it differs from <i>Chirostenotes</i>
in having a vascular foramen between metatarsals III and IV, an m.
tibialis cranialis tubercle on the dorsal surfaces of metatarsals
II-IV, a deeply concave posterior side, and a proximolateral process on
metatarsal IV. Yet these are all apomorphies that tell us nothing about
<i>Elmisaurus</i>' relationships unless we find non-caenagnathid taxa
that share them. Maryanska et al. stated pygostylians have the first
two characters, and <i>Avimimus</i> the last, but <i>Elmisaurus</i>
otherwise resembles oviraptorosaurs and is quite dissimilar to any
paravian. The relationship with <i>Avimimus</i> is possible, as found
in my modified version of the Hartman et al. matrix, but that taxon is
a caenagnathid in that tree anyway. It is especially confusing that
Maryanska et al. continue to refer <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
to Caenagnathidae, as it shares the characters they describe for <i>Elmisaurus</i>.
<i>Citipes</i> is similar enough to <i>Chirostenotes pergracilis</i>
to be synonymized by some authors (e.g. Currie and Russell, 1988), and <i>Elmisaurus</i>
has been synonymized with <i>Chirostenotes</i> by others (e.g. Paul,
1988). It is completely unwarranted to widely separate the two genera,
and <i>Elmisaurus</i> has more recently been reestablished as a
caenagnathid (e.g. Longrich et al., 2013; Currie et al., 2016).<br>
Currie (2001, 2002) first mentioned new specimens of <i>Elmisaurus
rarus</i>, most of which were later noted in an abstract (Funston and
Currie, 2014). Currie et al. (2016) described these specimens, as well
as additional material of ZPAL MgD-I/98. They identified the manual
ungual of the latter as "almost certainly" from digit I, which was the
possible identification of Osmolska as well despite her figure 2
placing it on digit II. While Funston and Currie state the frontal
"suggests the presence of a high crest", which is also assumed by
Currie et al., no evidence is presented to support this and the frontal
shows no dorsal projection. Only one specimen mentioned by Currie
(2001/2002) was not described in Currie et al.- a femur referred to cf.
<i>Elmisaurus rarus</i>.
Sniovely (2000) uses a metatarsus of "Elmisaurus sp. (TMP:PJC}" in his
thesis, which based on the outline in his Figure 2.11 is the holotype
or a cast of it.&nbsp; Tsuihiji et al. (2016) described a partial
mandible that is here referred to <i>E. rarus</i> based on
stratigraphy, but it cannot be distinguished from <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> based on morphology.
Ford (2015 online) reported a partial skull photographed in "a Japanese
guide book".<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>-
Currie (1989) proposed "close to the distal articular surfaces, small
processes of metatarsals II and IV overlap metatarsal III" is
diagnostic of <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>, but
they are not present in TMP 2000.012.0008.&nbsp; Currie used the
character "posteromedial corner of the tarsometatarsus is more deeply
emarginated than that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus
rarus</span>" to distinguish <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
based on the <span style="font-style: italic;">rarus</span> holotype
versus TMP 1982.039.0004, but the deep emargination is also seen in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span> specimen IGM 102/6
and not in <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span> specimens
ROM 781, TMP 1982.016.0006 or TMP 1996.012.0141.&nbsp; Currie stated
metatarsal II was more slender in <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
(maximum shaft diameter 9% of metatarsal length in holotype) than <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> (12% in holotype), but <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>
specimen IGM 102/6 has a ratio of 8%.&nbsp; He also listed
"longitudinal, ridge-like posterolateral margin of metatarsal IV is not
as powerfully developed proximally as that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>", but while this
appears true in his drawing of the <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
type, the ridge seems as well developed in all preserved areas although
far proximally it is restored in plaster (Funston et al., 2016: Fig.
3C3).<br>
Longrich et al. (2013a) proposed several differences in beak shape from
<span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span> based on the
assumption TMP 1992.036.0390 belonged to <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>- tip of beak strongly
upturned, with anterior occlusal margin projecting vertically; anterior
margin of symphysis straight; chin squarish in lateral view.&nbsp; Here
1992.036.0390 is referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
(see below), so that these are individual variation and/or taphonomic.<br>
Funston et al. (2016) claimed that "on metatarsal III of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>,
there is rugosity on the distal base of the lateral cruciate ridge, and
a small longitudinal ridge that bisects the longitudinal sulcus between
the cruciate ridges proximally" and that "both of these features are
absent in <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos elegans</span>."&nbsp;
Yet these are not visible in <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
specimens IGM 102/6 or 102/7 (Fig. 10 of Currie et al., 2016) or
available images of the holotype, so are not used here.&nbsp; Funston
et al. also proposed the posterior extension of the proximal
tarsometatarsus is smaller than <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>,
but this is not true in TMP 2000.012.0008.&nbsp; They also claim in <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>
"the distal third of the shaft of metatarsal II curves medially", but
this is only true in TMP 2000.012.0008 and not the holotype.&nbsp;
Similarly they say "metatarsal IV is straight along its length", but
this is untrue in the later described UALVP 59606.&nbsp; Finally, they
claim the "distal condyles of metatarsal III are deeper
anteroposteriorly than wide mediolaterally" in <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span>,
but show the opposite in their Table 1 for TMP 1982.016.0006 and
2000.012.0008, which is the case in the holotype as well (Currie, 1989:
Fig. 2r).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1926 and originally
described as a species of <i>Ornithomimus</i> (Parks, 1933), though
Sternberg (1934) soon recognized it was not an ornithomimid. Russell
(1972) synonymized it with <i>Macrophalangia canadensis</i>, while
Currie and Russell (1988) synonymized both with <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i>. The latter authors believed the <i>elegans</i>
specimen to be a gracile morph of the species, which could be called <i>Chirostenotes
elegans</i> if it was in fact taxonomically distinct. Currie (1989)
described two new specimens (ROM 37163 and TMP 1982.039.0004), noting
similarities to <i>Elmisaurus rarus</i> that were not seen in <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i>. He made the new combination <i>Elmisaurus elegans</i>.
These similarities were said to be insufficient by Sues (1997) (without
justification), who called the species <i>Chirostenotes elegans</i>.
Maryanska et al. (2002) and Osmolska et al. (2004) also assigned <i>elegans</i>
to <i>Chirostenotes</i> instead of <i>Elmisaurus</i>, though they
never state their rationale.&nbsp;<br>
When it came to cranial material, Currie and Russell (1988) first
proposed the synonymy of <i>Caenagnathus collinsi</i> with <i>Chirostenotes
pergracilis</i>, and <i>Caenagnathus sternbergi</i> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> (then <i>Chirostenotes</i>)
<i>elegans</i>. The new partial skeleton UALVP 59400 instead shows <span style="font-style: italic;">sternbergi</span> mandibles went with <span style="font-style: italic;">pergracilis</span> tarsometatarsi.&nbsp;
Longrich et al. (2013a) placed <i>elegans</i> in their new genus <i>Leptorhynchos</i>,
based on the Aguja Formation dentaries <i>L. gaddisi</i>. While the <i>gaddisi</i>
and <i>elegans</i> material is similar in size and tarsometatarsal
fusion, their reasons for separating these from <i>Elmisaurus</i> are
flawed (see <i>Leptorhynchos</i> comments), and there was no reason to
refer <i>elegans</i> to <i>Leptorhynchos</i> over <i>Elmisaurus</i>
or vice versa. Funston and Currie (2014b) agreed and called it <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus elegans</span>, but Currie et
al. (2016) and Funston et al. (2020) referred <i>elegans</i> to <i>Leptorhynchos</i>
without justification.&nbsp; Funston (2020) solved the issue by giving <span style="font-style: italic;">elegans</span> its own genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>,
which functions regardless of phylogeny.&nbsp; Notably, recently
recovered specimens show proposed differences between tarsometatarsi of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span>
vary individually within these taxa (see Other diagnoses above).&nbsp;
However, the tibiae and pedal phalanges are different showing along
with stratigraphy that they are not synonymous.<br>
Longrich et al. (2013a) referred dentaries TMP 1979.008.0622,
1991.144.0001 and 1992.036.0390 to their <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos elegans</span>,
and Funston et al. (2020) referred the third specimen as well.&nbsp;
This was based on putative differences in beak shape (see Other
diagnoses above) of 1992.036.0390, but it is similar in size to RTMP
1990.056.0006 which these authors considered to be <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> metatarsi are much smaller
than those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the large TMP 2001.012.0012 has an intermediate beak
shape, and 1990.056.0006 is taphonomically deformed to be assymetrical
which may have straightened its beak tip.&nbsp; Adding further
evidence, Funston et al. (2020) examined dentaries histologically and
found small
(symphyseal length 22.1 mm) UALVP 55639 to be a mature adult.&nbsp;
Thus Funston (2020) concluded the TMP dentaries "cannot be confidently
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes elegans</span>
without osteohistological analysis showing that they are adults" and
assigned them all to Caenagnathidae indet..&nbsp; I've provisionally
referred them all to <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
here, as all but one are larger than the confirmed mature UALVP 55639,
two have fibrous external bone texture and two have poorly developed m.
genioglossus attachments, both characters Funston et al. observed in
histologically juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>
TMP 1985.043.0070.&nbsp; This leaves UALVP 55639 the only recognized <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span> cranial element which is
unfortunate as it is quite fragmentary.&nbsp; Funston and Currie
(2014b) announced
several new specimens in an SVP abstract, later describing them in
Funston et al. (2016).&nbsp; One of these, partial tarsometatarsus TMP
1993.036.0181, was later reidentified by Funston and Currie (2021) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes pergracilis</span> based on
its large size and lack of fusion.&nbsp; Funston (2020) refers a few
new specimens to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>-
ilia and associated sacral TMP 1981.023.0034, 0035 and 0039, ilium TMP
1992.036.0674 and metatarsal IV UALVP 59606, describing them and
figuring the metatarsal.&nbsp; The ilia and sacral are figured in
Funston's (2019) thesis.<br>
Note TMP 1992.036.0674 is incorrectly listed on the TMP online
catalogue as Dromaeosauridae.<br>
Here, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Leptorhynchos gaddisi</span>
holotype is considered indeterminate and possibly juvenile (see
entry).&nbsp; However, among the referred material from the same
formation (Longrich et al., 2013a) the distal tarsal IV and metatarsal
IV (TMM 43057-36) are like <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus</span> in fusion and
size.&nbsp; It's provisionally referred to the contemporeneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipes elegans</span> here.<br>

Lu and Zhang assign it to Oviraptoridae, though Lu (2004) found
it to be a caenagnathid in a modified version of Maryanska's

II (203.5 mm), phalanx II-1 (44 mm), phalanx II-2 (29.9 mm), pedal
ungual II, metatarsal III (109 mm), phalanx III-1 (43.2 mm), phalanx
III-2 (31.2 mm), phalanx III-3 (24 mm), pedal ungual III (24.1 mm on
curve), metatarsal IV (208.1 mm), phalanx IV-1 (23 mm), phalanx IV-2
(20.3 mm), phalanx IV-3 (16 mm), phalanx IV-4 (11.2 mm), pedal ungual
IV (20 mm on curve), partial metatarsal V (~63 mm)<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Turner et al., 2009) combination of
hyperarctometatarsus (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
and derived alvarezsaurids) and robust flexor tubercles on pedal
unguals (also in <i>Patagonykus</i> and other oviraptorosaurs).<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Turner et al.'s (2009) statement,
metatarsal III does not extend over halfway up the metatarsus in <i>Kol</i>,
extending 44% instead as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>.
This is not higher up than other derived alvarezsaurids, as the ratio
in <i>Shuvuuia</i> varies between 33% (IGM 100/1276) and 47% (IGM
100/975), though it is more than in <i>Parvicursor</i> and <i>Ceratonykus</i>.
The short metatarsal II (98% of metatarsal IV length) is found in <i>Avimimus,
Parvicursor remotus</i> and <i>Ceratonykus</i> as well, but not in <i>Mononykus</i>,
<i>Shuvuuia</i> or IGM 100/99. Contary to Turner et al., <span style="font-style: italic;">Kol</span> lacks deep extensor grooves on
digit IV phalanges (pers. obs. IGM 100/2011).&nbsp; Contra their
diagnosis, the accessory dorsomedial flange on metatarsal II they list
is seemingly the dorsolateral flange on metatarsal IV, which is
mentioned in the text as being absent in contrast to <i>Mononykus</i>
and <i>Shuvuuia</i>. This is also present in <i>Parvicursor</i> and
IGM 100/99, but absent in <i>Alvarezsaurus </i>and<i> Avimimus</i>,
so is a symplesiomorphy. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Turner et al. (2009) described <span style="font-style: italic;">Kol</span> as an alvarezsauroid, proposing
it was more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Alvarezsaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Patagonykus</span>, but outside
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span> plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>
clade.&nbsp; It was later added to the TWiG analysis by Nesbitt et al.
(2011) where it emerged in precisely this position.&nbsp; Agnolin et
al. (2012) suggested <i>Kol</i> is actually a caenagnathid (related to
<i>Avimimus</i> due to its hyperarctometatarsus), based on the
prominently developed pedal flexor tubercles (plesiomorphic, also in <i>Patagonykus</i>),
metatarsal II shorter than metatarsals III and IV (plesiomorphic, also
in <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>, <i>Linhenykus</i>, <i>Parvicursor</i> and <i>Ceratonykus</i>;
variable in <i>Albinykus</i>), lack of a dorsomedial flange on the
medial side (plesiomorphic, also in <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>), and
metatarsal III that extends more proximally than one-half of the total
metatarsal length (plesiomorphic, also in <i>Alvarezsaurus</i>, <i>Achillesaurus</i>
and <i>Patagonykus</i>). As can be seen, these characters might make <i>Kol</i>
a comparatively basal alvarezsaurid, but they do not support an
oviraptorosaurian identity any better. Hartman et al. (2019) found it
more parsimonious for <span style="font-style: italic;">Kol</span> to
be a caenagnathid sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
including all the character evidence of Turner et al., but an
alvarezsauroid placement is only one step longer, suggesting more pedal
characters must be analyzed.to support either position<br>

(suggested) first pedal digit absent (unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">A. nemegtensis</span>).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Watabe et al. (2006) note Kurzanov (1981) was probably
mistaken regarding the type locality of <i>Avimimus</i>,
with Yagaan Khovil in the Nemegt Formation being more probable than
Udan Sayr in the Djadockta Formation. Tsuihiji et al. (2017)
incorrectly states the type locality is Shar Tsav.&nbsp; <br>

Kurzanov (1981) reported two specimens of his new taxon <i>Avimimus</i>
and described the holotype. The holotype was discovered in Summer
1973.&nbsp; He went on to describe the forelimb of the holotype (1982),
the pelvis of the holotype and PIN 3907/2 (1983), and the skull of PIN
3907/3 (1985). His 1987 monograph described these specimens and
additional ones (PIN 3907/4, 3907/5 and 3907/6) in detail, though it
has yet to be translated from Russian.<br>

Watabe et al. (2000) describe a nearly complete skeleton found in
August 14 1996
that corroborates Kurzanov's identification of several features (large
narial fossa in the premaxilla; narrow scapula and large coracoid; very
sharp and thin posterior ulnar ridge; completely fused carpometacarpus)
in addition to revealing new anatomical information (small premaxillary
teeth; anteroposteriorly elongate caudals with no evidence for a
pygostyle; very narrow rod-like radius).&nbsp; This was first noted by
Watabe and Suzuki (2000) as field number 960822 ShT ENK from Shar Tsav
and is photographed on page 67 as "Nearly complete skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>,
western area of Shar Tsav."&nbsp; It was later photographed after
preparation by Tsogtbaatar (2004; Plate 1 Figure 6) and Matsumoto et
al. (2010: Figure 1b).&nbsp; Tsuihiji et al. (2017) describe the
premaxilla and list the specimen as IGM 100/120, but it is called IGM
100/129 by Funston et al. (2019).&nbsp; Found at the same time, field
number 960822 ShT SZK is also from
Shar Tsav and was listed by Watabe and Suzuki and Matsumoto et al. as
well.<br>

Watabe and Tsogtbaatar (2004) report two <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
skeletons found on August 10 2000 from Yagaan Khovil (field numbers
000810 YK Avimimus UJ-1 and
UJ-2) as "cranial and postcranial elements of at least 2 individuals of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>, bird-like forms
including premaxilla with teeth, ilium, femur, tibia, cervical,
anterior and posterior vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, digits and claws of
pes (incluiding metatarsals), scapulocoracoid, ulna, carpometacarpal"
and photograph one (Plate 5, Figure 1) including a dorsal vertebra, two
centra, a proximal metatarsal II/IV, two pedal unguals and
fragments.&nbsp; Tsogtbaatar (2004) lists 000810 YK as "complete
pelvic, femur, scapula, vertebrae, ribs, digit", prepared in
2001.&nbsp; Tsogtbaatar and
Chinzorig (2010) list 000810 YK Avimimus UJ-1,2 as prepared and
consisting of a scapula, coracoid and pelvis, and 000810 YK WTB A-IV as
consisting of a fragment.&nbsp; <br>

Saneyoshi et al. (2010) reported nine additional specimens from Tagaan
Khovil found in 2007.&nbsp; <br>

Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig (2010) listed a prepared femur from Shar Tsav
found on July 20 2001, which was previously mentioned by Watabe et al.
(2004).&nbsp; <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The description of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. nemegtensis</span>
was online November 2 2017 but only physically published April 1
2018.&nbsp; The type bonebed was discovered in 2006, with the holotype
skull itself found on August 21 2007.&nbsp; At least 18 individuals are
present.&nbsp; The nasals are incorrectly called IGM 102/46 in the main
text, but are actually 102/64 with the collection number PJC2006.46
(Funston et al., 2016 supp. info).<br>

Collected
in June 8 2006, Watabe et al. (2010) first announced what would be
catalogued as IGM 100/125.&nbsp; Although they reference "several
partial skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>",
Appendix 1 indicates all 7 are the same specimen.&nbsp; Matsumoto et
al. (2010) list several prepared portions.&nbsp; Tsuihiji et al. (2017)
described a skull and identified two elements as
a maxilla and lacrimal, but using the scale bars both are too large
(especially the maxilla).&nbsp; Tsuihiji (pers. comm. 8-31-2017)
confirms the scale bars are correct and at least the maxilla is too
large, and notes no other individuals were present in the specimen so
element misidentification is likely.<br>

A proximal tarsometatarsus was described as Theropoda indet. by
Osmolska (1981), and later identified as <i>Avimimus</i> (Osmolska
pers. comm. to Currie, 1987; in Currie, 1989).&nbsp; As it is from the
Nemegt type locality, it is more probably <span style="font-style: italic;">A. nemegtensis</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">A. portentosus.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Makovicky (1995) stated "Avimimid vertebrae were collected by the
American Museum Central Asian expedition in 1922 at Iren Dabasu.
However, they were not recognised as such, and were catalogued with <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus asiaticus</span> (now <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus asiaticus</span>)
material", but the <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
type material was discovered in 1923 including a proximal caudal
referenced by the author.&nbsp; While he says "one of the caudals
collected by the American Museum's Central Asiatic Expeditions (AMNH
6576), [has] a small pointed tubercle separates the ventromedial
corners of the chevron facets" this specimen number includes almost a
hundred elements from the Johnson Quarry AMNH locality 141 generally
referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>.&nbsp;
A fibula (AMNH 6570) was figured as "alvarezsaurid fibula from Iren
Dabasu (Inner Mongolia, China)" by Chiappe et al. (2002), but Longrich
and Currie (2009) stated "it more closely resembles the fibula of
Avimimidae, which are common at this locality (N.R.L., pers.
obs.)."&nbsp; Again this number includes over two hundred paratype <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
elements, this time from the Kaisen Quarry AMNH locality 140.&nbsp;
Makovicky also stated "A large number of dorsal vertebrae are present
in the American Museum ... collections from Iren Dabasu", which are
likely to also be catalogued under AMNH 6570 and/or 6576.&nbsp;
Longrich's claim is supported here however as the fibula has an
anteriorly projected iliofibularis tuber as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
but unlike the laterally directed tuber of e.g. IGM 100/99 and is less
reduced distally in anteroposterior width than the latter.&nbsp; A
distal caudal
(AMNH coll.) described by Makovicky "has the morphology of a typical
coelurosaurian
distal caudal, but is otherwise undiagnostic. The possibility that it
may originate from an avimimid is suggested by its small size. It
should be noted, however, that it could just as conceivably be from the
tail of a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
from the same bonebed."&nbsp; Indeed, the <span style="font-style: italic;">A. nemegtensis</span> bonebed show <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> has short distal caudals
like other caenagnathoids and unlike ornithomimosaurs, so this specimen
is here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>.&nbsp;
The AMNH online catalogue lists AMNH 25569 as "10 vertebrae 1 caudal
vertebra 3 phalanges &amp; 5 claws" of Saurischia from the Johnson
Quarry with a pedal ungual photographed as Avimimidae.&nbsp; A
metatarsus (AMNH 6755) and third metatarsal (AMNH 6754) were listed on
the museum's online catalogue as <i>Elmisaurus sp</i>., but also
referred to <i>Avimimus</i> by Ryan et al. (2001) and Funston et al.
(for AMNH 6755 at least)<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.&nbsp;
Ryan et al.'s poster indicated both were found in 1923 and were
possibly associated.&nbsp; AMNH 6755 does seem smaller than other fused
<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> and less slender, so
further study is necessary.&nbsp; Note Funston et al. (2019) describe
and figure this as AMNH 6555, which is the number of ornithischian
material.&nbsp; Funston et al. state the main Iren Dabasu <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
bonebed "was originally discovered by a Sino-Soviet expedition in 1959,
which used bulldozers to excavate the site. It was revisited in 1987
and 1988 by the Sino-Canadian expedition and numerous fragmentary bones
representing all regions of the skeleton (Fig. 2) were recovered from
the spoil piles left by the Sino-Soviet bulldozers. Unfortunately, the
material collected by the Sino-Soviet expedition still awaits
preparation and it may never be available for study."&nbsp; This
indicates it must be locality K of Currie and Eberth (1993), which was
CCDP locality 1 and may correspond to AMNH locality 141.&nbsp; One
element from this excavation was described and figured by Kurzanov
(1987) as "a left avimimid femur from the Upper Cretaceous Iren-Nor
locality in China (specimen PIN, no. 2549-100)" (translated) but is
here placed in Oviraptoridae.&nbsp; While the PIN Sino-Soviet <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
material remains undescribed (although mentioned by Currie and Eberth),
the Sino-Canadian material was noted by Dong et al. (1989) who reported
"seven pedal elements of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>" discovered&nbsp; in
July 1988 and Dong (1992) refers to
"fused tarsometatarsi of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>"
recovered on that expedition in July 1998.&nbsp;
Currie and Eberth (1993) stated "Direct comparison between isolated <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> bones from the Iren Dabasu
and the type specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus
portentosus</span>
in Moscow failed to reveal any differences" and said the "material is
presently under review (Currie, Zhao and Kurzanov, in
preparation)."&nbsp; The Sino-Canadian <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> material was eventually
described by Makovicky, Ryan et al., then officially by Funston et al.
as <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
sp.. &nbsp; Makovicky used IVPP field numbers (of which IVPP 180788-123
may be a mistake for IVPP 160788-123 to better match the other two
listed numbers and only differ in the last digit), Ryan et al. used TMP
numbers in their poster, and the specimens were seemingly eventually
transported back to the IVPP for permanent storage.&nbsp; Note the
"isolated left frontal" mentioned by Sues et al. is not described in
Funston et al. (although the frontal is highlighted as preserved in
their figure 2), but Funston (2019) describes it in his thesis chapter
that was developed into that paper.&nbsp; In it he says "whether it
pertains to an avimimid or another oviraptorosaur is uncertain. It can
be distinguished from other theropods by the large, incising nasal
contact, which is similar to the morphology of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>",
so it's possible this belonged to the Iren Dabasu caenagnathid taxon
represented by dentaries IVPP V20377.&nbsp; IVPP 160788-124 is one of
three posterior dorsals without a ventral keel, so may be IVPP V16318.b
which was the only one of these figured by Funston et al..&nbsp;
Another tricky specimen is TMP 1992.302.0344 as illustrated in Ryan et
al.'s poster, which is tentatively identified as posterior cervical
IVPP V16318 as it seems to have a ventrally placed parapophysis, an
elongate centrum with vertical articular surfaces, two or three central
foramina and a dark neurocentral boundary perhaps representing an open
suture, but contra to Funston et al.'s description is not notably
smaller than other cervicals.&nbsp; While Funston et al. only referred
to the Iren Dabasu material as Avimimidae gen. et sp. indet., they also
stated "the cervicodorsal vertebrae differ in number (three with
hypapophyses) from those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus
portentosus</span> (MPC-D 100/129), although cervicodorsal number in <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus nemegtensis</span>
is unknown. The distal condyles of the femur (Fig. 6) are separated
much more deeply than is typical in avimimids, and metatarsals II and
IV (Fig. 8) are much more disparate in size", but ended up concluding
"the available material from the Iren Dabasu bonebed is too incomplete
to confidently erect a new taxon, but future
preparation of the Russian material (or collection of new material) may
result in its taxonomic distinction from other avimimids."<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Makovicky (1995) first noted "Isolated bones [of <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>]
have also been found in North America, including the Dinosaur Park
formation of Alberta (Currie, in prep.)."&nbsp; Currie (2000) stated "A
number of isolated vertebrae, tarsometatarsi and unguals have been
found in Upper Cretaceous strata of North America that closely resemble
those of Mongolian avimimids (collections of Royal Tyrrell Museum of
Palaeontology)", but Ryan et al. (2001) found that although there are
twelve elements in the TMP collections labeled Avimimidae, only two can
certainly be assigned to that taxon. One, TMP 1998.068.0022, is a
distal third metatarsal from the Dinosaur Park Formation. The other
(TMP 1998.008.0028) is a second metatarsal from the Scollard Formation
that is unfused proximally, unlike <i>A. portentosus</i>. This was
listed as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
sp. in Ryan and Russell (2001) and the TMP online catalogue includes a
photo that indicates it only preserves the distal end.&nbsp; The TMP
online catalogue includes nine avimimid records including metatarsi and
a pedal ungual, but no vertebrae.&nbsp; Note TMP 1989.069.0012 and
1990.151.0006 are listed as being from the Oldman Formation, but the
Onefour locality they were discovered in is in the Dinosaur Park
Formation.&nbsp; Funston (2019) states regarding Ryan et al.'s
specimens, "re-examination indicates that this material more likely
belongs to another small theropod" but with no rationale.&nbsp; Eberth
and Currie (2010) listed three avimimid elements from the <i>Albertosaurus</i>
bonebed of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Xue et al. (1996) report "ribs with horizontal
hooks", but no ribs are mentioned in the material list, nor are any
shown in the plates. If these are uncinate processes, they would
support a pennaraptoran identity.<br>
While<i> Shanyangosaurus</i> was originally identified only to the
level of Theropoda, it is most similar to oviraptorids (Mortimer, DML
2000; followed by Holtz et al., 2004) in the low acromion, absent
fourth trochanter, cnemial crest shape, unfused metatarsus whose fourth
metatarsal is wider than deep, and an elevated femoral head. Hartman et
al. (2019) were the first authors to include it in a phylogenetic
analysis, finding it emerged in Caudipteridae.&nbsp; Yet as it moves to
Oviraptoridae in one step, the cnemial crest shape was not analyzed,
and the age is more congruent with oviraptorids it is tentatively
placed there on this site.&nbsp; If it is constrained as an oviraptorid
in
an updated version of the analysis, it falls outside the "Huanansaurus"
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> clade.<br>

<b>Campanian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Cerro del Pueblo Formation, Mexico<br>
Comments</b>- Kirkland et al. (2000) stated "theropods are represented
by isolated bones (Fig. 13C), claws, and teeth indicating the presence
of tyrannosaurids, dromaeosaurids, ornithomimids, and
oviraptorids."&nbsp; Figure 13C is a hadrosaur femur, so the authors
apparently meant figure 12C consisting of theropod phalanges.&nbsp;
Some of these appear to be elements from the El Pelillal locality (e.g.
IGM-7710 and 7712) described by Rodriguez-De La Rosa and
Cevallos-Ferriz (1998), but Aguillon Martinez (2010) noted this
locality is actually from the younger Cañon del Tule Formation.&nbsp;
Although Aguillon Martinez stated "small vertebrates from the Cerro del
Pueblo Formation remain undocumented", Rodriguez-De La Rosa and
Cevallos-Ferriz do indicate "Theropoda Indet. family" remains are known
from several areas of the Cerro del Pueblo Formation- Presa San
Antonio, Agua de la Mula, La Rosa and Rincon Colorado area.&nbsp; That
being said, no oviraptorosaur material was noted by Aguillon Martinez
or Rivera-Sylva and Carpenter (2014) and so may have been misidentified.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Fanti et al. (2012) listed measurements for two

proportions may enable identification. Numerous unpublished oviraptorid
specimens are known and have been photographed online. Most are
referred to <i>Oviraptor</i>, <i>Conchoraptor</i> or "<i>Ingenia</i>",
but this is generally based on the pre-1980's convention of calling all
oviraptorids <i>Oviraptor</i> or the pre-2000 convention of calling
all crestless oviraptorids <i>Conchoraptor</i> or "<i>Ingenia</i>".
The more complete skeletons, especially when mounted, often contain
faked portions.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This taxon is known from three specimens with similar
high, pointed crests. Casts are common, with Prehistoric Planet Store
(online, 2019) listing one as being from Khermeen Tsav. This specimen
was analyzed by Jensen (2008), who called it <i>Oviraptor</i> sp.. <br>
The second specimen includes a manus preserved next to the skull and is
listed as <i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i>
on the Witmer Lab website (Witmer, 2012 online).&nbsp; As noted by Rey
(DML, 2003), Gee and Rey (2003) based their fictional oviraptorosaur
"Ronaldoraptor" on this skull, but as the taxon is not obviously
nonfictional in the book it is not considered actual nomenclature
here.&nbsp; Fanti et al. (2012) used UALVP casts (<span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> in their online
catalogue) to include
measurements of both specimens in their dataset as "oviraptorid
incertae sedis".<br>
U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of New York (online 2014)
report on a legal case where smuggled dinosaurs were being returned to
the CMMD in Mongolia, including "two freestanding Oviraptors."&nbsp;
One of these is photographed by Todd (2017 online) and has a cranial
crest similar in shape to the above specimens.&nbsp; While at least
some of the mounted skeleton must be real for it to be illegal to own
(and indeed the e.g. proximal scapula, some dorsal ribs and ilium seem
to be actual fossils), the texture of the forelimbs, feet otherwise
complete but both lacking digit I and metatarsal V, and low
cervicodorsal ratio suggest at least some is a cast.&nbsp; This
includes the possibility the skull is cast, which would eliminate the
only reason it is listed under this entry here, and it should be noted
the manus strongly differs from the UALVL 49393 specimen as well, with
shorter phalanges and a larger ungual I.&nbsp; The manus may be cast as
well of course.&nbsp; Making things even more ambiguous, the specimen
is listed as being from the Djadokhta Formation on its CMMD plaque, but
the associated point on the map is far to the west in Gurvantes, close
to Nemegt and Baynshiren loacilities but far from Djadokhta localities.<br>

(ZPAL MgD-I/96) fragmentary skull (Osmolska, 1976)<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These may be <i>Nomingia, Rinchenia, Gobiraptor</i>
or <i>Nemegtomaia</i> based on their provenence. <br>

Osmolska (1976) mentioned a fragmentary skull from the Nemegt Formation
of Mongolia housed in the ZPAL. She referred it to <i>Oviraptor sp.</i>
along with (?)<i>Conchoraptor</i> specimen ZPAL MgD-I/95 and another
specimen. Maryanska and Osmolska (1997) later described a fragmentary
skull from the same locality, referring to it as ZPAL MgD-I/96. The
identical locality and preserved material, along with the closeness in
specimen number to ZPAL MgD-I/95 lead me to believe this is the same
specimen Osmolska mentioned. It is described as crested, so may belong
to <i>Rinchenia</i> or <i>Nemegtomaia</i>, both also from the Nemegt
Formation.<br>

980807 GT Coy Oviraptr (a field number for a joint HMNS-IGM collection)
was found in August 7 1998 at Gurilin Tsav, and was
said along with 980807 GT
SZK Oviraptr (now IGM 102/12) to "belong to a single
species, which is similar to the partial skeleton of oviraptorosaurians
found at Bugin Tsav in 1994 by our party" (Suzuki and Watabe,
2000).&nbsp; It was later photographed as figure 18 of Tsogtbaatar
and Chinzorig (2010) once prepared, which shows differs from Funston's
Guriliin Tsav oviraptorid (including IGM 102/12) in having a shallower
postacetabular
process with greater invagination of the ischial peduncle, so is a
different taxon.<br>

Currie (2001) listed "Oviraptorid, partial skeleton" as excavated
September 10-24 2000 from Khermeen Tsav, Nemegt Formation, so probably
the Upper White Beds.<br>

Weishampel et al. (2008) described a nest of four embryos which they
stated resembled <i>Nemegtomaia</i> slightly more. <br>

Currie et al.'s (2008) material is from an <i>Avimimus</i> bonebed,
who noted less than ten percent was from other genera including
oviraptorids.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The eggs of NMNS-VPDINO-2002-0901 are preserved inside
the pelvic cavity and resemble <i>Macroolithus yaotunensis</i> and <i>M.

Cheng et al. (2008) found Chimei Museum 41 and
NMNS-0015726-F02-embryo-01 were assignable to <i>Macroolithus
yaotunensis</i>. They assigned these to <i>Heyuannia</i> "or an
oviraptorosaurian of similar kind" based on its subarctometatarsaly.
Yet this is true in most other oviraptorids as well except for <i>H.
yanshini,</i><i> Gigantoraptor </i>and "Tongtianlong", although not
scorable in any genus except the latter from the Nanxiong formation. <br>

He et al. (2012) remark on an additional specimen with two internal
eggs, assignable only to Elongatoolithidae. <br>

Wang et al. (2013) note embryos from the same formation inside of <i>Macroolithus
yaotunensis</i> eggs. These are detailed in Wang et al. (2016), which
only identifies the embryos as Oviraptoridae.<br>

Wiemann et al. (2015) report several eggshells they refer to <i>Macroolithus
yaotuensis</i> and <i>Heyuannia</i>,
but the latter is based on the flawed reasoning of Cheng et al..&nbsp;
These are said to be from the "Nanxiong Formation of the Hongcheng area
near Ganzhou City", which probably refers to the Hongcheng Basin.&nbsp;
In Supplementary Table 2 of the published 2018 version, they are said
to be from the Yuanpu Formation, which has since become the Dafeng and
possibly the Zhutian Formation depending on whose stratigraphy the
authors were using (Li et al. 2007 or Zhang et al 2013).<br>

These remains may belong to the contemporaneous <i>Banji</i>,
"Huanansaurus", "Corythoraptor"<i>, Jiangxisaurus</i>, "Tongtianlong",<i>
Ganzhousaurus</i> and/or <i>Nankangia</i>. <br>

with distinct concave posterior facet (roughly as tall at the base as
it is wide); preacetabular process of ilium longer than postacetabular
process; posterior end of postacetabular process truncated or broadly
rounded; accessory trochanter of femur weakly developed.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
There is ambiguity in the formation the holotype was recovered from.
Grellet-Tinner (2005) listed it as being from the Maastrichtian
Zoumagang Formation, along with the Nanyang Museum nest and LACM
F.A.3818,2001-1. Simon (2014) listed Wang and Zhou's (1995) material as
being from the Cenomanian-Turonian Gaogou Formation, Liang et al.'s
(2009) as being from either formation, and Fang et al.'s (1998) as
being from the Zoumagang Formation, while Li et al.'s (1995) eggs were
not specified as belonging to a particular formation. Pu et al. (2017)
tracked the holotype locality to the Gaogou Formation, but whether Li
et al.'s, Fang et al.'s, Liang et al.'s and/or Grellet-Tinner's
materials are also actually from this formation is unclear.&nbsp; Pan
et al. (2016) concur and narrow the Gaogou Formation's age to Coniacian.<br>

The embryo nicknamed Baby Louie was discovered between December 1992
and early 1993 and donated to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis,
though it was returned to China in 2013. Currie (1996) initially
reported the specimen as a therizinosaur, since being reidentified as
an oviraptorid (Norell and Clark, pers. comm. to Grellet-Tinner,
2005).&nbsp; Grellet-Tinner (2005) described the eggs in detail
(published as Grellet-Tinner et al., 2006), though Baby Louie itself
was not named or described in detail until Pu et al. (2017).&nbsp; The
partial radius, ulna several vertebral centra and some rib fragments
"are associated with another egg (#4) in the specimen, which may belong
to the skeleton or to another perinate" (Pu et al., 2017).<br>

Identical eggs from the same formation were described as the ootaxon <i>Macroelongatoolithus
xixiaensis</i> (Li et al., 1995), senior synonym of <i>Longiteresoolithus
xixiaensis</i> (Wang and Zhou, 1995) from the same formation. The
former species has since been synonymized with <i>M. carlylensis</i>
by Zelenitsky et al. (2000) and Simon (2014). <br>

pneumatic" and the last four caudals "form a pygostyle-like structure."
As the type material of <i>Macroelongatoolithus carlylensis</i>

species. This was originally described as <i>Oolithes carlylensis</i>
by Jensen, then referred to <i>Macroolithus</i> by Zhao (1975), and
named as the new genus <i>Boletuoolithus</i> by Bray (1998), before
being referred to <i>Macroelongatoolithus</i> by Zelenitsky et al.
(2000). <i>M. carlylensis</i> was emended to <i>M. carlylei</i> by
Zelenitsky et al. (2000), but while the ICZN states species should
originally be named this way (Article 31.1.3), it is not a spelling
that must be corrected (Article 32.5).<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype was discovered in August 24 1994, prepared in 1997
(Tsogtbaatar, 2004), illustrated in Sloan
(1999) and described briefly by Barsbold et al. (2000) before its
official publication. Watabe and Suzuki (2000) provide a photo of the
specimen in situ as "Postcranial skeleton of Oviraptorosauria from
Bugin Tsav (Nemegt Formation)" and list it as "Oviraptorosauria whole
skeleton without skull" with its field number.&nbsp; The taxon was
originally called "Nomingia brevicaudia" (initially misspelled online
as "Nomingis brevicauda" by the Dinosauricon e.g Brush, DML 1999), but
was changed shortly
before publication (Skrepnick, DML 2000). The latter species name has
never been published however.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018) proposed it
may be synonymous with the contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Elmisaurus rarus</span>, but combining the
OTUs takes 7 more steps in Hartman et al.'s (2019) analysis.<br>

Barsbold et al. (2000) did not place <i>Nomingia</i> in a family, but
stated the long preacetabular process, straight pubis and strong
posterior curve to the ischium might suggest caenagnathid affinities.
Maryanska et al. (2002) first included it in a phylogenetic analysis
and found <i>Nomingia</i>
to be placed in the Caenagnathidae, but future analyses such as a more
recent Maryanska derivative Funston and Currie (2016), Cau et al.
(2017) and Hartman et al. (2019) have recovered it as a basal
oviraptorid.&nbsp; <br>

The holotype was a subadult based on the unfused sutures between
presacral neural arches and centra. Based on comparison to oviraptorids
and adjusting for the shorter tail, it may have been about 1.8 meters
long.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Lu et al. (2015) state "Huanansaurus" "was unearthed from the current
construction site of the Ganzhou Railway Station."&nbsp; It was
described on July 2 2015 as a new taxon
of oviraptorid.&nbsp; However, this paper has no mention of ZooBank
and as of February 6 2020
"Huanansaurus" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.&nbsp; Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Huanansaurus ganzhouensis" Lu
et al., 2015 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically.<br>
Lu et al. (2014) announced this specimen in an abstract as a sister
taxon to <i>Citipati</i>. It was fully described and named by Lu et
al. (2015), and emerged in a trichotomy with <i>Citipati osmolskae</i>
and IGM 100/42 in their analysis derived from Maryanska et al.'s
oviraptorosaur matrix.&nbsp; Cau et al. (2017) also recovered it sister
to <span style="font-style: italic;">C. osmolskae</span> (but not IGM
100/42) while Hartman et al. (2019) find it more basal.<br>

These specimens probably belong to the same individual, called NXMV by
Lu (2004). While Lu states it "came from the top of the Pingling Member
of Shanghu Formation (Zhang, Personnel communication, 2002) or the top
of the Pingling Formation (Zhao, personnel communication, 2002)", the
Pingling Formation was replaced by the Zhenshui Formation by Li et al.

<br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (GMNH F10003) anterior mandibles, five mid dorsal
vertebrae (38, 37, 38, 39, 40 mm), partial penultimate sacral vertebra,
last sacral vertebra (43 mm), three proximal caudal vertebrae (38, 44,

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Lu et al., 2013) rostral end of mandibular
symphyseal region not downturned (also in caenagnathids, <i>Incisivosaurus</i>,
<i>Luoyanggia</i> and <i>Ganzhousaurus</i>); two infradiapophyseal
fossae on ventral surface near base of transverse process of dorsal
vertebrae; pneumatic fossae on sacral vertebrae slit-like; neural
spines of proximal caudal vertebrae wider transversely than
anteroposteriorly, forming a large posterior fossa with rugose central
area; large fossa on anterior surface (infraprezygapophyseal fossa) and
another (infradiapophyseal fossa) on ventral surface of base of

Yao et al. (2019) analyzed "Lingyuanosaurus" in a version of Zanno's
therizinosaur matrix and resolved it between <span style="font-style: italic;">Beipiaosauirus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>
as a therizinosauroid.&nbsp; However, when Mortimer added the taxon to
Hartman et al.'s (2019) analysis, it emerged as an oviraptorid.&nbsp;
Of the supposedly therizinosaurian characters listed by Yao et al.,
Zanno's "dorsal vertebrae with a complex laminar structure" refers to
mid-dorsals ("anterior dorsals" in Zanno's nomenclature) which are not
preserved in "Lingyuanosaurus"
and nor was that character (their 274) scored for the taxon.&nbsp;
Oviraptorosaurs can have both "laterally flattened manual unguals with
dorsally positioned collateral grooves" (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Chirostenotes</span>)
and "a highly modified ilium with a deep preacetabular process, a
reduced postacetabular process, a preacetabular process whose ventral
margin is dorsally displaced relative to the acetabulum" (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rinchenia</span>).&nbsp;
The slender pubic peduncle is therizinosaur-like, however.&nbsp; It
only takes one more step to move the taxon to Therizinosauria, and four
more to move to Ornithomimosauria.&nbsp; Notably, Zanno's
oviraptorosaur sample was limited due to Balanoff working on the group
at the time.<br>

41HIII-0108 were found associated, the others were found in separate
quarries up to 4 km apart. The diagnostic characters may merely be
characteristic of juvenile oviraptorids, and <i>Yulong</i>'s recovered
poisition in Lu et al.'s (2013) Maryanksa et al.-based analysis
(between <i>Gigantoraptor</i> and more derived oviraptorids) may be
basal due to ontogenetically variable characters, as juvenile theropods
commonly end up more basally than adults.<br>

<p> Oviraptorinae Barsbold, 1976a sensu Barsbold, 1981<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (<i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i> + <i>Citipati
osmolskae</i>) (Osmolska, Currie and Barsbold, 2004)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Barsbold created this taxon to separate <i>Oviraptor</i>
(to which he referred specimens now distinguished as <i>Conchoraptor</i>
and <i>Citipati? sp.</i>) from <i>"Ingenia"</i>. Once he named <i>Conchoraptor</i>
and <i>Rinchenia</i> (originally <i>Oviraptor mongoliensis</i>),
these were placed in Oviraptorinae as well. Barsbold et al. (1990)
retained this taxonomy, though their cladogram shows oviraptorines to
be paraphyletic to "ingeniines", with <i>Conchoraptor</i> closer to <i>"Ingenia"</i>
than to <i>Oviraptor</i> (still including <i>Citipati? sp.</i>).
Similarly, Maryanska et al. (2002) recovered <i>Rinchenia</i>, <i>Citipati</i>
and <i>Conchoraptor</i> as paraphyletic to <i>"Ingenia"</i>. The
definition of Osmolska et al. (2004) functions in their phylogeny,
where <i>Rinchenia</i> and <i>Citipati</i> form a clade exclusive of <i>"Ingenia"</i>,
<i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>Khaan</i>. <i>Oviraptor</i> was not
included in the analysis, but was assumed to be part of this clade,
perhaps due to its cranial crest. <i>Heyuannia</i> was assigned to
Oviraptorinae in their taxon list, but not included in the analysis,
nor was the rationale for the assignment discussed.&nbsp; It's apparent
the original concept of Oviraptorinae is probably not monophyletic with
respect to "Ingeniinae", and using Osmolska et al.'s definition leads
to situations where useful similarity to their or Barsbold's concept of
the taxon is lost. A more useful definition would be (<i>Oviraptor
philoceratops</i> &lt;- <i>Heyuannia yanshini</i>), or with the recent
replacement of "Ingeniinae" with Heyuanninae (<span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor philoceratops</span> &lt;- <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia huangi</span>).<br>

? Ukhaa Tolgod, Djadochta Formation, Mongolia</b><br>
?(IGM 100/1125) two eggs (Grellet-Tinner, 2005)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Clark et al., 2002) anterodorsally sloping
occiput and quadrate; parietal much longer along the midline than the
frontal and reaching nearly to the level of the anterior end of the
orbit; ascending process of jugal perpendicular to the horizontal ramus
(rather than extending posterodorsally); external naris nearly
circular; nasal process of premaxilla vertical rather than sloping
posterodorsally; cervical vertebrae elongate (approximately twice as
long as they are wide).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The first published specimen of this species was an
embryo discovered in 1993 in a nest of eggs (Norell et al., 1994),
later described in detail by Norell et al. (2001). Originally assigned
to Oviraptoridae indet., it was tentatively referred to the then
unnamed <i>Citipati osmolskae</i> by Norell et al. (2001) and formally
referred to that taxon by Clark et al. (2001). Two partial juvenile
paravian skulls were found with the specimen, originally identified as <i>Velociraptor</i>
(Norell et al., 1994) and later troodontids (Norell and Makovicky,
1999).<br>
Norell et al. (1995) announced a brooding oviraptorid on a nest found
in 1993, which was initially referred to <i>Oviraptor</i> based on
manual resemblences. It was mentioned in the popular press as "Big
Mama". The specimen was later described in detail (Clark et al., 1999)
and said to be an oviraptorid most closely related to <i>Oviraptor</i>,
before being officially referred to <i>Citipati osmolskae</i> by Clark
et al. (2001).<br>
A second brooding <i>Citipati</i> specimen found in 1995 is known as
"Big Auntie" (Clark pers. comm. to Auditore). It was mentioned by
Webster (1996) and Clark et al. (1999). A photograph of this specimen
is present in Codd (2004), incorrectly identified as IGM 100/42.
Similarly, it is photographed and incorrectly identified as <i>Oviraptor
philoceratops</i>
holotype AMNH 6517 by Codd et al. (2007). Erickson et al. (2009)
examined it histologically, Grellet-Tinner (2005) described the eggs in
detail in his thesis, and the specimen was fully described by Norell et
al. (2018).&nbsp; The eggs are most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elongatoolithus frustrabilis</span>.<br>
The holotype of the genus, a virtually complete specimen found in 1994,
was initially identified as <i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i>
(Webster, 1996) until it was preliminarily described and officially
named by Clark et al. (2001). The skull and mandibles were later
described in detail by Clark et al. (2002), though the postcrania
remains largely undescribed and unillustrated, with only Nesbitt et al.
(2009) and Balanoff and Norell (2012) showing the furcula and
describing some details. More recently, Persons et al. (2014) describe
the tail and pygostyle, while Norell et al. (2018) illustrate the third
to fifth cervical vertebrae and two uncinate processes.&nbsp; Balanoff
et al. (2018) described the endocranium based on Balanoff's (2011)
thesis.<br>
Norton (DML, 2000) noted IGM 100/1009 was discovered in 1993 at Ukhaa
Tolgod and was on display at the AMNH Fighting Dinosaurs exhibit.
Bhullar et al. (2012) listed it as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipati</span>
embryo.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Clark et al., 2001) anterior edge of the
premaxilla is concave in lateral view; vomers unfused; cervical
vertebrae are not elongate.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was originally identified as <i>Oviraptor
philoceratops</i> (Barsbold, 1981), an identification which persisted
unquestioned through the 80's and 90's (e.g. Barsbold, 1983, 1986;
Barsbold et al., 1990; Maryanska et al., 2002). The completeness
relative to the <i>O. philoceratops</i> holotype resulted in IGM
100/42 becoming the standard example of the species. In 2001, Clark et
al. realized the specimen was more similar to the recently named <i>Citipati
osmolskae</i>, and may represent another species of that genus. Clark
et al. (2002) reiterated this, while Osmolska et al. (2004) found it to
be the sister taxon of <i>Citipati osmolskae</i> in their cladistic
analysis. However, Lu (2004) found that IGM 100/42 was the sister taxon
to <i>Oviraptor</i> or <i>Conchoraptor</i> (depending on taxa
included) using Maryanska et al.'s (2002) characters. This and the
resemblence of the more recently described <i>Nemegtomaia</i> (which
was more closely related to <i>Citipati</i> than to IGM 100/42 or <i>Oviraptor</i>
in Lu's analysis) suggests we use caution when assigning IGM 100/42 to
a particular genus.<br>
The specimen has never been described in detail, though many elements
have been illustrated in varied sources. Barsbold (1981) illustrated
the skull, mandible, furcula, sternal plates and manual phalanges. He
later (1983) illustrated the skull in ventral view, mandible in medial
view and scapulocoracoid. Barsbold et al. (1990) illustrated the skull
in dorsal view, humerus, complete manus, and metatarsus. Jensen (2008)
analyzed the skull for his thesis and presented detailed photographs.
The almost complete skeleton is mounted, but publically available
photos are too small to be useful. The data matrices of Norell et al.
(2001), Maryanska et al. (2002) and Osmolska et al. (2004) are the most
useful published sources of information besides the figures. Fanti et
al. (2012) and Currie et al. (2016) provide measurements.<br>

of largely undescribed and unassociated specimens, AMNH 6570 from Third
Asiatic Field site 140 and AMNH 6576 from site 141, discovered between
April 22 and May 25 1923.&nbsp; Based on personal
examination (July 2009), multiple elements in these collections do not
belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>,
among which is an ungual in a box of
phalanges and calcanea under AMNH 6570.&nbsp; It is moderately curved
with a
large, proximally placed flexor tubercle and resembles both
<span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>' pedal ungual I
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipati</span>'s
manual ungual I in its
preserved portion. As it is twice the length of Iren Dabasu's
troodontid pedal unguals I but scales well to PIN 2549-100, the latter
identification is provisionally preferred here.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Barsbold
(1986) originally distinguished <span style="font-style: italic;">mongoliensis</span>
from <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor philoceratops</span>
(including IGM 100/42) based on its smaller size, more robust build,
and dome-shaped ridge on the skull roof.<br>
Barsbold (1997) later distinguished <span style="font-style: italic;">Rinchenia</span>
from <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
(still including IGM 100/42) based on its "higher dome-like crest that
incorporates the parietals", "more lightly built" postcranium and lower
cervical vertebrae.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1984.&nbsp; Barsbold
(1986) originally described this specimen as a new species of <i>Oviraptor</i>,
but later (1997) assigned it to a new genus, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rinchenia</span>.
While Olshevsky (DML, 1997) declared it a nomen nudum because "the
redescription of the species and formal assignment as type species of
the new genus is in press", these are not valid reasons according to
the ICZN.&nbsp; In particular, it satisfies Article 11, Article 13.1.1
by being "accompanied by a description or definition that states in
words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon" ("about
the same size as <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>,
but the skull has a higher dome-like crest that incorporates the
parietals in addition to the premaxillae, nasals, and frontals. The
postcranium is more lightly built, and the cervical vertebrae are
rather low in comparison with those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>";
contra Funston et al., 2018), and Article 13.3 by being "accompanied by
the fixation of a type species in the original publication" via Article
68.3 ("When an author establishes a new nominal genus-group taxon for a
single taxonomic species and denotes that species by an available name,
the nominal species so named is the type species").&nbsp; <br>
The skull
and mandible were first illustrated by Barsbold (1986), the ilium by
Barsbold et al. (1990), and the twenty-sixth caudal vertebra by
Barsbold et al. (2000).&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018) photographs most
elements except the manus and some vertebrae.&nbsp; Snively (2000)
studies and illustrates a metatarsus as <i>Rinchenia mongoliensis</i>,
but the specimen number (IGM 100/42) shows this is actually <i>Citipati
sp.</i> nov.. Funston et al. also provides a brief description and
states "a complete anatomical description is forthcoming." A detailed
description is present in his 2019 thesis.&nbsp; Fanti et al. (2012)
provide measurements.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 2009. This entry
switches the identification of manual digits II and III (III and IV of
the authors) based on figure 2A, as there is no room for a third
non-ungual phalanx in the uppermost digit. The length of the complete
phalanx in the other digit and fragmentary nature of more distal
phalanges makes this uncertain, however. Xu et al. (2013) proposed <i>Wulatelong</i>
was a basal oviraptorid, but it clades with <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> when additional taxa are
added to the Hartman et al. analaysis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- "Tongtianlong" was first announced by Lu et al. (2015)
was later described by Lu et al. on November 10 2016 as a new taxon
of oviraptorid.&nbsp; However, this paper has no mention of ZooBank
and as of February 6 2020
"Tongtianlong" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.&nbsp; Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Tongtianlong limosus" Lu
et al., 2016 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically.<br>
Lu et al. (2016) recovered this as a heyuannine sister to <i>Wulatelong</i>+<i>Banji</i>
in their analysis using a modified version of Maryanska et al.'s
oviraptorosaur matrix.&nbsp; In Hartman et al.'s matrix this clades

<b>Comments</b>- The first oviraptorid discovered (on July 3, 1923), it
was initially annouced as <span style="font-style: italic;">Fenestrosaurus
philoceratops</span> in an article by Osborn (1924a).&nbsp; Osborn
describes it as "a small birdlike dinosaur, remains of which were found
resting on top of one of the nests of dinosaur eggs; hence the specific
name <span style="font-style: italic;">philoceratops</span>,
signifying "ceratops lover", "egg-eating or ovivorous. This dinosaur
was without teeth."&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
was originally referred to the Ornithomimidae by Osborn (1924b). <br>
<i>Oviraptor</i> was originally hypothesized to be an egg-eater
(Osborn, 1924) based on close association with a supposed <i>Protoceratops</i>
nest with eggs (AMNH 6508). However, Norell et al. (1994) discovered a
brooding oviraptorid specimen which showed the nest and eggs belonged
to <i>Oviraptor</i> itself. The diet of <i>Oviraptor</i>
is still debated although a lizard preserved in the holotype's body
cavity (Norell et al., 1995) suggests it was at least partially
carnivorous.&nbsp; Norell et al. (2018) reported and illustrated an
embryo or nestling hindlimb associated with the specimen (AMNH 33092)
to "be described in detail in another paper."<br>
The holotype was only briefly illustrated and described by Osborn
(1924b), but a detailed redescription has not yet appeared. Smith's
(1992) attempt made many errors, which were corrected by Clark et al.
(2002) in their description of the skull. Makovicky (1995) added
information about the preserved vertebrae, though the appendicular
remains remain largely ignored.&nbsp; Carrano (1998) listed the femoral
length as 282.0 mm, dspite the hindlimb being unpreserved.&nbsp; Norell
et al. (2018) included
photos of the cervical and pectoral areas.<br>
Osborn (1924b) initially assigned <i>Oviraptor</i> to Ornithomimidae,
and even after the naming of Oviraptoridae and discovery of more
genera, was not placed in a cladistic context until Barsbold et al.
(1990). The latter authors positioned it outside Heyuanninae. This is
found in nearly all analyses since, despite the massive increase in
taxon number. The remaining unknown is whether <i>Oviraptor</i> is
basal to <i>Citipati</i>+<span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span>,
or closer to some taxa with short dentaries.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Not </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Oviraptor</span>-
Barsbold (1976) erected Oviraptoridae for the holotype and referred six
individuals including IGM 100/20 and 100/21 to <i>Oviraptor
philoceratops</i>. They were later (Barsbold, 1986) made the holotype
and paratype of a new genus, <i>Conchoraptor</i>. Osmolska (1976)
believed these and additional material (three skulls including ZPAL
MgD-I/95 and MgD-I/96 and fragmentary postcrania) belonged to a new
species, referring to them as <i>Oviraptor sp.</i>. None of these are
referred to <i>Oviraptor</i> currently, with ZPAL MgD-I/95 most often
being assigned to <i>Conchoraptor</i> (Maryanska et al., 2002;
Kundrat, 2007) or <i>"Ingenia"</i> (Paul, 1998). ZPAL MgD-I/96 is
crested and from the Nemegt Formation, so may be <i>Rinchenia</i> or <i>Nemegtomaia</i>.
Barsbold (1981) referred IGM 100/42 to <i>O. philoceratops</i>, which
resulted in this specimen being the standard example of the species
through the 80's and 90's (e.g. Barsbold, 1983; Barsbold, 1986;
Barsbold et al., 1990; Maryanska et al., 2002). This was finally shown
to be incorrect by Clark et al. (2002), who noted a greater resemblence
to <i>Citipati osmolskae</i>, and assigned it to that genus. <i>Citipati</i>
specimens, including IGM 100/979 (Clark et al., 1995) and the holotype
IGM 100/978 (Webster, 1996) were referred to <i>Oviraptor</i> based on
cranial and manual resemblences to IGM 100/42 until the distinctness of
<i>Citipati</i> was recognized by Clark et al. (2001). In addition, <i>Rinchenia</i>
(IGM 100/32) was originally described as <i>Oviraptor mongoliensis</i>
(Barsbold, 1986) before being renamed unofficially by Barsbold in 1997
and officially by Osmolska et al. in 2004. Paul (1988) lumped <i>"Ingenia"</i>
into <i>Oviraptor</i> as <i>O. yanshini</i>, but this would result in
almost all oviraptorids being <i>Oviraptor</i> in modern phylogenies.
Dong and Currie (1996) referred a fragmentary skeleton (IVPP V9608) to <i>Oviraptor
philoceratops</i>, but this may be <i>Citipati</i> instead and was
referred to Oviraptorinae indet. by Longrich et al. (2010). Morell
(1997) labeled IGM 100/1002 <i>Oviraptor</i> before it was made a
paratype of <i>Khaan</i> by Clark et al. (2001). Jensen (2008) calls
the tall-crested cast PMO X678 <i>Oviraptor</i> sp., which may be the
same taxon as a skull and manus on the Witmer Lab website (Witmer, 2012
online) labeled <i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i>, but how taxon this
related to <i>Oviraptor</i> requires further study. Balanoff and
Norell (2012) list IGM 100/791 as a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor philoceratops</span>, but it is
mentioned nowhere else except a similar list in Balanoff's (2011)
thesis.&nbsp; Numerous other oviraptorid specimens, have been called <i>Oviraptor</i>,
but only the holotype can be properly referred to the genus.<br>

<b><a name="Ingeniinae"></a>Heyuanninae </b>Yun, 2019<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition</span>- (<span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia huangi</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor gracilis</span>) (Yun, 2019)<b><br>
</b>= "Ingeniinae" Barsbold, 1981<br>
Definition- (<i>"Ingenia" yanshini</i> + <i>Conchoraptor gracilis</i>)
(Osmolska, Currie and Barsbold, 2004) <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Barsbold (1981) created Ingeniinae to separate his new
genus <i>Ingenia </i>from <i>Oviraptor</i> (to which he referred
specimens now distinguished as <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>Citipati sp.</i>).&nbsp;
However, as Taylor (DML 2004) noted, the genus is preoccupied by a
tripyloidid nematode (Gerlach, 1957) so any family level taxon based on
it must refer to nematodes.&nbsp; A search of the nematode literature
suggests that the internal struicture of Tripyloididae reamins
unresolved and that no nematode subfamily Ingeniinae has been
proposed.&nbsp; Once Barsbold named <i>Conchoraptor</i> and <i>Rinchenia</i>
(originally <i>Oviraptor mongoliensis</i>), these were excluded from
"Ingeniinae" as well. Barsbold et al. (1990) retain this taxonomy,
though their cladogram shows oviraptorines to be paraphyletic to
"ingeniines", with <i>Conchoraptor</i> closer to <i>"Ingenia"</i>
than to <i>Oviraptor</i>.&nbsp; Maryanska et al. (2002) found <i>Conchoraptor</i>
and <i>"Ingenia"</i> to be in a clade exclusive of <i>Citipati</i>
and <i>Rinchenia</i>, noting this was equivalent to "Ingeniinae" but
poorly supported by data.&nbsp; Osmolska et al. (2004) officially
defined the taxon, as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor
gracilis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia yanshini</span>,
their most recent common ancestor, and all descendants."&nbsp; More
recently, in Funston and Currie (2016) <span style="font-style: italic;">Machairosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiangxisaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Nemegtomiaia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span> would also fall under
this definition.&nbsp; Adding taxa to Hartman et al.'s matrix would
also include <span style="font-style: italic;">Khaan</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobiraptor</span>.<br>
Yun
(2019) noted that the subfamily needed to be renamed, so suggested
Heyuanninae as a replacement with the definiotion "the least inclusive
clade containing <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia huangi</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor gracilis</span>."&nbsp;
As <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span> is almost always
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ingenia"</span>in
oviraptorosaur topologies, the definitions usually cover the same
taxa.&nbsp; Although the correct stem would be Heyuanniinae, ICZN
Article 29.5 states "If a spelling of a family-group name was
not formed in accordance with Article 29.3 but is in prevailing usage,
that spelling is to be maintained, whether or not it is the original
spelling and whether or not its derivation from the name of the type
genus is in accordance with the grammatical procedures in Articles
29.3.1 and 29.3.2."&nbsp; More recently Funston et al. (2020) used
Heyuanninae as a stem-based group opposing their new subfamily
Citipatiinae although they did not explicitly define it as such.&nbsp;
If such a definition is proposed in the future, <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>
needs to be an additional external specifier because it cannot be a
heyuannine according to the ICZN (it must be an oviraptorine).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype of <i>Conchoraptor</i> was discovered in
1971 and photographed by Barsbold (1976). At the time, it was referred
to <i>Oviraptor philoceratops</i>. Additionally, a mandible of IGM
100/21 was photographed, while the morphology of these and four other
specimens was briefly described. Barsbold (1977) noted cranial
characterics of Khermeen Tsav oviraptorids, probably including IGM
100/20 as well as <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia yanshini</span>
material. Barsbold (1981) illustrated a furcula of IGM 100/36,
referring it and three other "supposedly young" specimens to <i>O.
philoceratops</i> as well. These are probably IGM 100/38, 100/39,
100/46 and 100/47 listed in Maryanska et al. (2002) and may be the four
specimens noted by Barsbold (1976). In 1986 Barsbold named <i>Conchoraptor
gracilis</i>
based on IGM 100/20, illustrating a skull and manus as that specimen
number.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018) also list 100/20 as including the
manus, but Fanti et al.'s (2012) measurement table would suggest the
manus (with incomplete unguals I and II and partial phalanx II-1) is
IGM 100/38.&nbsp; Whether 100/36 was separated from 100/20 after 1986,
Fanti et al. incorrectly listed 100/20 measurements as 100/36 or some
other explanation is correct is unknown.&nbsp; Barsbold et al. (1990)
illustrated the skull in dorsal view and also a metatarsus and two
pedal unguals, which may belong to IGM 100/46 since it is the only
original specimen given pedal measurements by Fanti et al.. The skull
was photographed incorrectly mounted on <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia yanshini</span> postcrania in
Psihoyos (1994), as later specifically noted by Funston et al. (2018).
This same mount (with a mandible that is neither <i>Conchoraptor</i>'s
nor <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>'s holotype) was
displayed at the Nakasato Dinosaur Center as <i>Ingenia</i> and is now
at the IGM.&nbsp; Fanti et al. listed IGM 100/36 among <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span> specimens and incorrectly
listed IGM 100/80-D as the holotype skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>,
though Funston et al. (2018) state that holotype skull is labeled IGM
100/80-1 on the IGM mount.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018) photograph and
describe the holotype skull and mandible, further described in
Funston's (2019) thesis.<br>
Osmolska (1976) described a skull and mandibles (ZPAL MgD-I/95) as <i>Oviraptor
sp.</i>. She also noted an additional skull and postcranial fragments
from the same formation, and a fragmentary skull from the Nemegt
Formation. She believed they and the IGM specimens noted by Barsbold
(1976) belonged to a new species. The Nemegt skull (probably ZPAL
MgD-I/96) is crested and thus not <i>Conchoraptor</i>, but the other
specimens may be. Possible specimen numbers for the second Khermeen
Tsav skull are MgD-I/101 (listed on the ZPAL website as oviraptorid),
and MgD-I/100 or MgD-I/106 (listed as <i>Conchoraptor</i> by Maryanska
et al., 2002; but not given cranial measurements by Fanti et al.,
making them less likely candidates). ZPAL MgD-I/95 was illustrated as <i>Oviraptor
yanshini</i> by Paul (1988), while Elzanowski (1999) described its
palate in detail and called it <i>Oviraptor sp.</i>.&nbsp;
Specimen numbers indicate all ZPAL specimens are from the Baruungoyot
or Nemegt Formations.&nbsp; Maryanska and Osmolska (1997) stated it was
probably <i>Conchoraptor</i> or <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>,
along with a few additional fragmentary skulls (GIN 100/30A and two
unnumbered GIN specimens called GIN A and B). Most recently, it was
listed as <i>Conchoraptor</i> by Maryanska et al. (2002) and Funston
et al. (2018) and had its braincase and cranial pneumaticity described
by Kundrat (2007) and Kundrat and Janacek (2007), who referred to it as
<i>Conchoraptor</i>. Holtz (1994) has been the only publication since
Osmolska (1976) to reference the postcrania, listing the metatarsus of
ZPAL MgD-I/95 (as <i>Conchoraptor</i>) in a measurement table.<br>
Fanti et al. (2012) lists MPC-D 102/03 as a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span> and provides
measurements, although they say "a pair of <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia</span>
collected at Khermeen Tsav [MPC-D 102/02, MPC-D 102/03] by an earlier
"Dinosaurs of the Gobi" expedition."&nbsp; Funston et al. (2016) cites
the specimen as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor gracilis</span>
(MPC-D 102/3; M. A. Norell pers. comm.)" containing multiple
individuals, and his thesis confirms they were found at Khermeen Tsav
in 2002.&nbsp; Thus the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia</span>"
pair IGM 110/2 and 110/3 in Fanti et al.'s list are probably different,
and indeed 102/3 is about twice the size of 110/3, and Funston's (2019)
figures confirm 102/3 matches that number in Fanti et al.'s measurement
table.&nbsp; Funston reported online (2018) that he was describing an
incomplete
skull (IGM uncatalogued) found in 2018 and
postcranial skeletion (which is IGM 102/3- Funston, 2019) for his 2019
thesis (7-5-2019 Facebook).&nbsp; The
first manual digit seems far more robust than the holotype/paratype,
but further evaluation pends on publication of the thesis.<br>
Additional material has also been referred to <i>Conchoraptor</i>.
Barsbold et al. (2000) listed a tail (IGM 110/19) as belonging to the
taxon, while Lu (2004) noted distal caudal vertebrae and pelvic
elements from <i>Conchoraptor</i> specimen IGM 110/18. Besides ZPAL
MgD-I/100 and 106, Maryanska et al. (2002) refer a PIN specimen and
multiple unnumbered IGM specimens to it. The PIN specimen is quite
possibly a skull and mandibles referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span> by Glut (1997) and Witmer
(online, 2012 4), as Witmer notes it is from the PIN. It was also
photographed in Currie (2001). Osmolska et al. (2004) illustrate a
skull as <i>Conchoraptor</i> that appears to be neither the holotype,
ZPAL MgD-I/95 or the PIN specimen, and may therefore be one of the
other specimens mentioned above. Jensen (2008) analyzed a cast for his
thesis (PMO X677) which he referred to <i>Conchoraptor gracilis</i>.
Erickson et al. (2009) examined the histology of IGM 97/212, which they
referred to <i>Conchoraptor gracilis</i>.&nbsp;
Balanoff and Norell (2012) mention many postcranial characters, largely
from IGM 100/1203 and 100/3006, noting an in prep. paper.&nbsp;
They also list IGM 100/19 as a specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor gracilis</span>,
but it is mentioned nowhere else except a similar list in Balanoff's
(2011) thesis.&nbsp; This thesis states both are from Ukhaa Tolgod in
the Djadochta Formation, although Funston et al. (2018) stated 100/3006
is from Khulsan in the Baruungoyot Formation.&nbsp; Cervicals and the
ribcage of IGM 100/1203 are photographed in Norell et
al. (2018).&nbsp; Fanti et al. and Lu et al. (2013) listed numerous
specimens as belonging to this species and provided measurements. Among
these is IGM 100/1275, which Balanoff and Norell (2012) mention
numerous details of and Persons et al. (2013) describe the tail of.
The latter authors note this specimen is one of many partial skeletons
found together and catalogued as IGM MAE 97-212. Other specimens such
as IGM 100/1203 and 3006 may also belong here, and Balanoff et al.
(2014) have described the braincase of IGM 100/3006 based on Balanoff's
(2011) thesis.<br>
It is especially common to find crestless privately held oviraptorid
specimens being referred to <i>Conchoraptor</i>.
One such incomplete skeleton ("Conchoraptor Juvenile in 3-D matrix
block" on Gaston Design) is listed as being from the Red Beds of
Khermeen Tsav, but has manual proportions more similar to <i>Heyuannia</i>,
so is
provisionally referred to that taxon here. Another specimen (cast is
offered by Gaston Design as "Conchoraptor Adult in matrix 44"" - Gaston
Design, 2019 online 2) is more difficult to identify as it doesn't
preserve arms, though the constricted third metatarsal is unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia yanshini</span>.&nbsp; Witmer
Labs has a cast offered by Gaston
Designs as "Conchoraptor Juvenile skeleton in 2-D matrix Block".&nbsp;
Witmer (2012 online labs) has two skulls referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>.&nbsp; Persons et al.
(2015) list four <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>
UALVP specimens' proximal caudal measurements, which are likely casts
such as these.&nbsp; The UAPVP online catalogue assigns each to
Khulsan.&nbsp; A slab of six juvenile skeletons at the CMMD (cast UALVP
54983) has been referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>
in the literature (e.g. Funston et al., 2015), but is here placed as a
separate heyuannine.<br>
One notable issue surrounding <i>Conchoraptor</i>
is the possibility some referred specimens belong to other taxa, as no
referred specimen has ever been assigned to the genus based on shared
derived characters with the holotype. For instance, Funston et al.
(2018) provided the diagnosis listed above and listed ZPAL MgD-I-95 as
referrable, but the promaxillary fenestra size has yet to be shown in
the holotype, the number of nasal fossae might be seen in the poor
quality photo of Osmolska (1976) and the postorbital extent cannot be
measured in that specimen.&nbsp; This is particularily worrisome given
the discovery of additional uncrested oviraptorids such as <i>Khaan</i>
and <i>Heyuannia</i>, and the possibility young specimens of crested
oviraptorids may lack crests (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Yulong</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Banji</span>).&nbsp; Although some
information can be found in Barsbold (1976), Barsbold et al. (1990), Lu
(2004), Osmolska et al. (2004), Funston et al (2018), the specimens
examined are not specified (a recent exception is Balanoff and Norell,
2012). Similarly, the matrices of Norell et al. (2001), Maryanska et
al. (2002), Lu (2004), Fanti et al. (2012) and Lu et al. (2013) are
extremely informative and indicate basically every element is
represented in at least one specimen, but obviously don't indicate
which specimens were used to code each character. Maryanska et al. do
list several specimens they used to code their <i>Conchoraptor</i>
OTU, but ironically the holotype was not among them. The measurement
tables in Fanti et al. and Currie et al. (2016) will prove useful to
refer specimens based on ratios once they are examined. <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Funston et
al., 2020) apically thickened, dome-shaped cranial crest composed
equally of nasals and frontals; nasal recesses housed in a depression;
postorbital with dorsally directed frontal process; cervical vertebrae
with large epipophyses; functionally didactyl manus; accessory ridge of
brevis fossa of ilium; anteriorly curving pubis; large proximodorsal
process of distal tarsal IV.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Funston et al. (2017)
mention "three articulated juvenile skeletons,
representing a new species of oviraptorid theropod" confiscated from
poachers in December 14 2006.&nbsp; They state the taxon has "a domed
cranial
crest, a functionally didactyl hand, and a short tail."&nbsp; A brief
writeup of the presentation by Watson (2017) photographs the specimens,
noting they were found at Bugin Tsav and estimated at 45 kg.&nbsp;
Funston et al. (2018)
calls the taxon represented by all of these specimens the Guriliin Tsav
oviraptorid and stated it "will be
described elsewhere (Funston et al., submitted)", which was the
Funston et al. in review manuscript cited by Funston (2020) and
published as Funston et al. (2020).&nbsp; The latter paper states that
the precise locality of discovery within the Nemegt Formation is
unknown.&nbsp; The specimens are identified as IGM 102/110a, 110b and
110c in order of completeness.&nbsp; <br>
Discovered in 1974, Barsbold (1981) first mentioned IGM 100/33 as a
paratype of <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ingenia" yanshini</span>,
then illustrated its furcula and sternal plates in 1983.&nbsp; Barsbold
et
al. (2000) illustrated the nineteenth caudal vertebra and pelvis. The
latter appears more similar to the figure in Barsbold et al. (1990)
than to the <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>
holotype, perhaps indicating the 1990 figure was based on IGM
100/33.&nbsp;
Funston et al. (2018) noted differences from the <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span> holotype such
as only six sacral vertebrae (instead of eight), non-hatchet-shaped
caudal transverse processes, unfused sterna, a more reduced metacarpal
III and no fibulotarsal contact.&nbsp; They also note that Barsbold
(1983)
expanded the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>
to include Bugin Tsav (Nemegt) in
addition to Khermeen Tsav (Baruungoyot), and that "it is possible that
MPC-D 100/33 comes from Bugiin Tsav, but there is no detailed locality
data for the specimen."&nbsp; By Funston et al. (2020) it was stated to
be from Bugin Tsav without reservation.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018)
stated "the sacral count, enlarged first manual
digit, reduced third metacarpal, and lack of fibulocalcaneal contact"
are shared between the then unnamed <span style="font-style: italic;">Oksoko</span>
and IGM 100/33, and the specimen was referred to that specimen when it
was described in Funston et al. (2020).<br>
IGM 102/12 (originally HMNS-IGM field number 980807 GT
SZK Oviraptr) is from Gurilin Tsav and was
said along with 980807 GT Coy Oviraptr to "belong to a single
species, which is similar to the partial skeleton of oviraptorosaurians
found at Bugin Tsav in 1994 by our party" (Suzuki and Watabe,
2000).&nbsp; However, 980807 GT Coy Oviraptr has a shallower
postacetabular
process with greater invagination of the ischial peduncle, so is a
different taxon.&nbsp; IGM 102/12 was found in August 7 1998, initially
photographed it in situ as
"Oviraptorosaurian skeleton
in Gurilin Tsav" by Suzuki and Watabe, then was later
photographed as figure 13 of Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig (2010) once
prepared.&nbsp; In Funston et al. (2015) IGM 102/12 is listed as cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia yanshini</span> and given caudal
and femoral measurements.&nbsp; Funston and Currie (2016) mentions IGM
102/12 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia</span>
and state it has "downturned, rounded preacetabular blades."&nbsp; The
skeleton is photographed on Funston's blog (Funston, 2018
online).&nbsp; Funston et al. (2017)
mention it as "an unpoached, partial adult skeleton from Guriliin
Tsav", and it was officially referred to their new genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Oksoko</span> by Funston et al.
(2020).&nbsp; The latter state "manual ungual I-2 was recovered in 2018
when the site was revisited."<br>
IGM 102/11 was listed the same way as 102/11 by Funston et al. (2015)
and Funston and Currie (2016).&nbsp; Funston et al. (2016) figure its
distal metatarsal III as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia
yanshini</span>Barsbold,
1981 (MPC-D 102/011), provenance unknown: confiscated
specimen."&nbsp; It was labeled "an unnamed oviraptorid
from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia" by Funston and Currie (2018),
who figured its distal tibiotarsus.&nbsp; The skeleton is photographed
on Funston's blog (Funston, 2018 online), who assigned it to the same
species as IGM
102/12.&nbsp; This shows it is "the second poached skeleton [of] an
even younger individual" confiscated in December 14 2006 mentioned in
Funston et
al.'s (2017) abstract on Oksoko and was referred to the genus by
Funston et al. (2020).&nbsp; They note that "associated with it are the
postorbital, quadrate and quadratojugal of a slightly larger
individual" which they call IGM 102/11-B.<br>
Funston
(2019) describes all of these specimens in detail in his thesis, which
also includes more figures than the published description.&nbsp;
Funston et
al. (2020) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Oksoko</span> to
the Maryanska et al.-based oviraptorosaur analysis to find it a
heyuannine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiangxisaurus</span>,
then <span style="font-style: italic;">Banji</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1988 and 1990, the type specimens of <i>Machairasaurus
leptonychus</i> were described by Longrich et al. in 2010 as a new
taxon. They used a version of Osmolska et al.'s oviraptorosaur matrix
which placed <i>Machairasaurus</i> in Heyuanninae, more derived than <i>Khaan</i>
and <i>Conchoraptor</i> but more basal than <i>Heyuannia</i>.&nbsp;
This holds for future iterations of that matrix as well, such as
Funston and Currie (2016), but&nbsp; after adding taxa to Hartman et
al.'s matrix the genus falls out closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span>.&nbsp; Fanti et al.

<b>Comments</b>- IGM 100/973 was discovered in 1993 and first
photographed in Novacek et al. (1994). It was photographed in Dashzeveg
et al. (1995) as <i>cf. Ingenia</i>, and labeled <i>Ingenia yanshini</i>
in Webster (1996). IGM 100/1127 and 100/1002 were discovered in 1995,
and the latter was photographed in Morell (1997) and labeled <i>Oviraptor</i>.
Clark et al. (2001) made these their new taxon <i>Khaan mckennai</i>.
IGM 100/1002 and 100/1127 were found in close proximity to each other,
and have been called "Romeo and Juliet."&nbsp; Balanoff and Norell
(2012)
recently described the taxon in depth and Balanoff et al. (2018)
described the endocranium, both based on Balanoff's (2011)
thesis.&nbsp; Person et al. (2015) noted the proximal chevrons of IGM
100/1002 were more elongate and distally expanded unlike 100/1127,
which they considered plausibly sexual dimorphism with 100/1127 being
the female.<br>
Gatesy and Middleton (1997) published hindlimb measurements for an
"undescribed oviraptorid (Norell pers. comm.)" which is a <i>Khaan</i>
specimen based on nearly identical measurements listed by Dyke and
Norell (2005).&nbsp; Balanoff (2011) included the partial skull IGM
100/1253 in her oviraptorosaur analysis and recovered it as either
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Khaan</span> or to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipati</span> plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Gigantoraptor</span>, but considered it
most likely a <span style="font-style: italic;">Khaan</span> specimen.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Lu et al., 2004) nasopremaxillary crest; anterior margin of

of parietal; presence of prefrontal; process on&nbsp; quadrate bears
convex surface projecting into cotyla on medial surface of
quadratojugal; mandibular condyles of quadrate situated anteriorly to
occipital condyle.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in the summer of 1996 and
originally called <i>Ingenia sp.</i> by Lu (1999) and Lu et al.
(2002), then <i>Oviraptor sp.</i> in Lu (2004). Lu et al. (2004)
described it in detail and named it <i>Nemegtia</i>, though it was
renamed by Lu et al. (2005) because <i>Nemegtia</i> is a genus of
cypridid ostracod (currently considered a junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Talycypridea</span>). Mounted skeletons
incorporating the <i>Nemegtomaia</i> holotype exist but are
misleading, as most of the appendicular and caudal material is faked.
Note Fanti et al. (2012) claimed IGM 107/16 was from the Nemegt and
Baruungoyot Formations in different parts of their paper, but personal
communication (1-11-2017) from Fanti indicates the original collection
information is incomplete and the associated sediment leaves Fanti
favoring a source in the Nemegt Formation.&nbsp; Originally recovered
as sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Citipati</span> in Lu
et al. (2004), it has more recently been found to be sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>(Funston and Currie, 2016; Hartman

Taylor (DML, 2004). Barsbold is aware of the situation, but Easter
(2013a) did not consult him, proposing his own replacement name <span style="font-style: italic;">Ajancingenia</span> in a publication which
largely consisted of copied and reworded information from this website
used without my permission. While the initial objection to citing The
Theropod Database was editorial, Easter did not object to this, lied
about consulting with Barsbold in an online forum and took credit for
my work in that same forum. Based on my objection, an erratum was
published (Easter, 2013b), and while his name remains technically valid
according to the ICZN, I do not support its use due to Easter's
unprofessional and unethical actions.&nbsp; Funston et al. (2018)
proposed a solution where <span style="font-style: italic;">Ajancingenia</span>

<b>Comments</b>- First discovered in the summer of 1999, Lu (2002)
briefly described <i>Heyuannia</i>, then described it in more depth
including additional specimens in his 2004 thesis (published as a book
in 2005). The forelimb and pectoral girdle were described further by Lu
et al. (2005), though they incorrectly illustrate HYMV1-6 as 1-4.&nbsp;
Qiu and Huang (2001) previously mentioned <i>Ingenia</i> bones and
supposed oviraptorid eggs from the same locality, which are therefore
probably <i>Heyuannia</i> instead. A nearly complete privately owned
skeleton has been cast and widely distributed as <i>Conchoraptor</i>
("Conchoraptor Juvenile in 3-D matrix block" on Gaston Design), but its
manual proportions more nearly resemble <i>Heyuannia</i>. This it is
provisionally referred to <i>Heyuannia</i> <span style="font-style: italic;">huangi</span> here, though it is
supposedly from the Red Beds of Khermeen Tsav like <i>Conchoraptor</i>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia yanshini</span>.<br>
Cheng et al. (2008) referred two <i>Macroolithus yaotunensis</i> eggs
with embryos (Chimei Museum 41 and NMNS-0015726-F02-embryo-01) from the
Nanxiong Group of Jiangxi to <i>Heyuannia huangi</i> "or an
oviraptorosaurian of similar kind" based on subarctometatarsaly. Yet
this is true in most other oviraptorids as well except for <i>Gigantoraptor</i>,
"Tongtianlong" and<i> Heyuannia yanshini</i>. Wiemann et al. (2015a, b)
used Cheng et al.'s paper to justify assigning all <i>M. yaotunensis</i>
eggs to <i>Heyuannia</i>, including specimens from the Hugang
Formation of Henan, the Yuanpu or Pingling Formation of Guangdong and
the Nanxiong Group of Jiangxi.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span>'s stratigraphy has
been confused, with Lu (2002) initially listing it as being from the
Dalangshan Formation based on a 1988 source, but that has more recently
been confined to the more southern Sanshui Basin, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span>
is from the Heyuan Basin.&nbsp; Similarly, Lu (2004, 2005) used the
revised stratigraphy of Zhang et al. 2005 to equate the Heyuan Basin to
the nearby Nanxiong Basin and so assigned <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span>
to the Zhutian Formation of the Nanxiong Group.&nbsp; More recently the
stratigraphy of Fang et al. 2004 has been used where in the Heyuan
Basin the Dongyuan Formation is equivalent to the Zhutian and Zhenshui
Formations of the Nanxiong Group, assigning <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span> to that (e.g. Fang et
al., 2009).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Barsbold (1977) described cranial characterics of
unspecified Khermeen Tsav oviraptorids, including "<i>Ingenia</i>"
paratype IGM 100/31 and probably <i>Conchoraptor</i> material. He
illustrated a mandible which was later labeled <i>Ingenia</i> by
Barsbold et al. (1990) and is probably IGM 100/31 based on the scale
bar and measurement in Fanti et al. (2012).&nbsp; "<i>Ingenia</i>"
was first described by Barsbold (1981), who illustrated the manual
digits of the holotype and mentioned three other specimens in addition
to the holotype (IGM 100/31-33). Barsbold (1983) didn't expand on the
description, but did illustrate the holotype's braincase, furcula and
sternum. Barsbold (1986) later illustrated the humerus, femur and
metatarsus of the holotype. Barsbold et al. (1990) added some further
information and illustrated the humerus in different views, radius,
ulna, complete manus, pelvis and complete hindlimb missing only
metatarsal V, pedal phalanx II-2 and digit I. These may all be from the
holotype as well, but the specimen numbers were not listed. Psihoyos
(1994) includes a photograph later revealed to be a composite of the
holotype, IGM 100/31 and 100/32 (Funston et al., 2018), which is
largely complete except for the dorsal series, though the skull of the <i>Conchoraptor</i>
holotype is mounted on
it. This mount was displayed at the Nakasato Dinosaur Center with a
mandible that is neither 100/30, 100/31 or 100/20 (previously online
photos).&nbsp; Barsbold et al. (2000) illustrated the twenty-seventh
caudal vertebra of IGM 100/32. Lu (2004) noted many anatomical details,
including noting some of the elements preserved in paratype specimens.
Osmolska et al. (2004) illustrated a scapulocoracoid that is different
from the holotype and described several anatomical details. Osmolska
(2003, 2004) described the skull roof of IGM 100/31, which she probably
incorrectly stated was from the White Beds of Khermeen Tsav, which are
slightly younger than the Red Beds (Nemegt instead of Baruungoyot).
Funston et al. (2018) is the first published source to identify the IGM
mount as a composite of IGM 100/30, 100/31 and 100/32 and provides the
sources of all elements.&nbsp; They state the braincase of 100/30 and
skull roof of 100/31 are lost.&nbsp; Funston et al. also say "There are
eight sacral vertebrae (labeled MPCD 100/30), which appear to be fused
with the ilia (labeled MPC-D 100/ 31). It is possible that these
elements were artificially connected during the creation of the mount,
or that the labels are incorrect."&nbsp; This brings Lu's (2004)
statement IGM 100/31 has eight sacral vertebrae into question, as it
may have been based on this mounted specimen.&nbsp; Fanti et al. (2012)
and Currie et al. (2016) provide measurements of numerous elements. <br>
Snively (2000) studied and illustrated the metatarsi of IGM 100/32 and
100/34 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia yanshini</span>
based on photos and measurements from Currie (PJC 1998 II). Maryanska
et al. (2002) lists the latter specimen and IGM 100/35 as <span style="font-style: italic;">I. yanshini</span>, while Lu (2004) notes
cervical and cranial characters of IGM 100/80-1. The latter is notable
as previously the only <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>
cranial material thought to exist was the braincase of the holotype
(and possibly different skull roof of IGM 100/31), whereas Lu's
statements imply much of the skull is present in IGM 100/80-1.
Confusingly, Fanti et al. list IGM 100/80-D as a skull and the holotype
of <i>Conchoraptor</i>, and Funston et al, (2018) state the mounted <span style="font-style: italic;">Conchoraptor</span> holotype skull at the
IGM is labeled 100/80-1.&nbsp; So perhaps Lu was mistaken in assigning
the skull to <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>, but he
also stated IGM 100/80-1 has eleven cervical vertebrae when the IGM
mount only has nine cervicals from the <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span> holotype.&nbsp; Currie
(2002) noted a new partial skeleton (PJC.2001.2) from the Nemegt
Formation which he referred to cf. <i>Ingenia</i> sp.. It may end up
to be referrable to <i>Nomingia, Gobiraptor, Rinchenia</i> or <i>Nemegtomaia</i>
which are present in that formation.&nbsp; As with <i>Conchoraptor</i>,
no evidence has ever been published defending the placement of
paratypes or referred material in <span style="font-style: italic;">yanshini</span>
and several specimens have been removed (see below).&nbsp; The
measurements and other referred specimens are all based on measurement
tables in Fanti et al. (2012), except two IGM specimens Lu et al.
(2013) call c.f. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia</span>
Confiscated 1 and 2.&nbsp; PJC.2001.2 was referred to <i>cf. Ingenia
sp.</i>
by Currie (2002).<br>
<b>Not <i>"Ingenia"</i></b>- <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ingenia"
yanshini</span>
paratype IGM 100/33 was illustrated by Barsbold (1983) and Barsbold et
al. (2000), but was removed by Funston et al. (2018) due to having six
sacrals, unfused sterna and no fibulotarsal contact among other
characters.&nbsp; Paul (1988) illustrated ZPAL MgD-I/95 as <i>Oviraptor
yanshini</i>, a combination no other workers follow as it would result
in placing most oviraptorids in <i>Oviraptor</i> given recent
phylogenies. ZPAL MgD-I/95 is currently assigned to <i>Conchoraptor</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Khaan</i> paratype IGM 100/973 was first photographed in Dashzeveg
et al. (1995) as cf. <i>Ingenia</i>, and labeled <i>Ingenia yanshini</i>
in Webster (1996). This is the source of the Djadochta Formation
listing for cf.<i> Ingenia </i>sp. in Weishampel et al. (2004). A
skull and mandibles in the PIN collections are referred to <i>Ingenia
yanshini</i> by Glut (1997) and <i>Ingenia</i> sp. by Witmer on his
website (Witmer, online 2012). This is possibly the PIN coll. specimen
referred to <i>Conchoraptor</i> by Maryanska et al. (2002) and is
assigned to that genus here. Maryanska and Osmolska (1997) note ZPAL
MgD-I/95 and a few additional fragmentary skulls (GIN 100/30A and two
unnumbered GIN specimens called GIN A and B) from the Red Beds of
Khermeen Tsav may belong to <i>Ingenia</i> or <i>Conchoraptor</i>.
The holotype of <i>Nemegtomaia</i> was originally called <i>Ingenia</i>
sp. by Lu (1999) and Lu et al. (2002), which is the source of the
Nemegt Formation listing for <i>Ingenia</i> sp. in Weishampel et al.
(2004). Qiu and Huang (2001) mentioned <i>Ingenia</i> bones and
supposed oviraptorid eggs from the locality <i>Heyuannia</i> was later
described from in Guangdong, China. They are thus more probably <i>Heyuannia
huangi</i> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">H.
yanshini.&nbsp; </span>IGM 110/11 and 110/12 were listed by Funston et
al. (2015) as c.f. <span style="font-style: italic;">Ingenia yanshini</span>,
but have been reidentified as the unnamed Guriliin Tsav oviraptorid
(Funston, 2018 online).<br>

<b>Early Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Altan Uul III, Nemegt Formation, Mongolia<br>
Holotype</b>- (IGM 102/111) (juvenile) partial skull, incomplete
mandibles, last sacral vertebra (25.5 mm), first caudal vertebra (23.1
mm), second caudal vertebra (24.3 mm), seven proximal caudal vertebrae
(22.8, 24.2, 23.6, 23.6, 23.2, 21.4 mm), proximal chevron fragments,
proximal scapula, coracoid fragment(?), proximal humerus, ilia (one
partial, one incomplete), incomplete pubis, partial ischium, femora
(195.7 mm), distal tarsal III, distal tarsal IV, metatarsal I (28.8
mm), phalanx I-1 (23.1 mm), pedal ungual I,&nbsp; metatarsal II (108.2

(29 mm), proximal phalanx III-3, metatarsal IV (112.4 mm), phalanx IV-1
(20.5 mm), phalanx IV-2 (18.6 mm), phalanx IV-3 (16.2 mm), phalanx IV-4
(12.2 mm), pedal ungual IV, metatarsal V (4.2 mm)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Lee et al.,
2019) flat articular surface for quadratojugal on quadrate;
anteroposteriorly elongate dentary anterior to external mandibular
fenestra; extremely thickened anterodorsal end of&nbsp; mandibular
symphysis with posterior expansion of its dorsal surface; rudimentary
lingual triturating shelf on dentary bearing small occlusal foramina;
weakly developed lingual ridge on each lingual shelf; anterior end of
coronoid wedging into ventral surface of dorsal dentary process.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 2008,
Lee first named and described this in his 2018 thesis before officially
describing and naming it in 2019.&nbsp; In both papers, it emerged as a
heyuannine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Jiangxisaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Banji</span> and
"Tongtianlong".&nbsp; When added to the Hartman et al. matrix it
emerges sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia yanshini</span>,
so may end up falling under the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia</span>
if future studies support this.<br>
