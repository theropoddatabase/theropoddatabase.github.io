<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Montmirat theropod- This is the still unnamed MM-2-21.<br>
  <i>Albertosaurus</i>- This was coded based on Lambe (1917), which is a specimen 
  of <i>Gorgosaurus libratus</i>.</p>
<p><b>Character Issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> does not have a short, broad scapular blade (Madsen 
  and Welles, 2000). </p>
<p>2. <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> has a highly expanded distal scapula (&gt;2 times 
  minimum blade width) (Lambe, 1917), so is recoded.</p>
<p>3. The third character state (subrectangular coracoid) is useless as only one 
  taxon is coded for it.</p>
<p>4. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has elongate forelimbs (50% of hindlimb length) 
  (Novas, 1993; Sereno, 1993). <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Gilmore, 1920), <i>Carnotaurus</i> 
  (Bonaparte et al., 1990) and <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> (Sadlier et al., 2008) 
  clearly have short forelimbs, despite not being completely preserved. </p>
<p>5. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has short forelimbs and manus relative to the presacral 
  column and pes respectively (Novas, 1993; Sereno, 1993). Those of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> 
  (Gilmore, 1920), <i>Carnotaurus</i> (Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i>Piatnitzkysaurus</i> 
  (Bonaparte, 1986) and <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> (Sadlier et al., 2008) are also 
  short, though only partially preserved. This character ends up being a useless 
  autapomorphy of <i>Deinonychus</i> in the matrix in addition to being partially 
  correlated with character 4.</p>
<p>6. The humerus of <i>Herrerasaurus</i> is ~110% scapular length (Novas, 1993) 
  and that of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> is 99% (Madsen and Welles, 2000), so are coded 
  as plesiomorphic. It is also correlated with character 4, as any taxon with 
  a humerus shorter than its scapula also ends up having forelimbs shorter than 
  50% of hindlimb length.</p>
<p>7. <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> both have twisted humeral 
  shafts (Carrano et al., 2005). Twisting in <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i>' humerus 
  has not been described, so is recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>8. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has a sigmoidal humerus (Sereno, 1993)</p>
<p>9. <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000), <i><b>Eustreptospondylus</b></i> 
  (Sadlier et al., 2008) and <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> (Osmolska et al., 1972) 
  have small medial tubers on their humeri, though this should really be quantified.</p>
<p>10. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> (Sereno, 1993), <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  (Welles, 1984) and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Madsen and Welles, 2000) have distal 
  humeral ends expanded as much as basal tetanurines, while the <b>Montmirat</b> 
  specimen seems to have a small expansion.</p>
<p>11. While incomplete, the manus of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (Gilmore, 1920; Madsen 
  and Welles, 2000) and <i>Carnotaurus</i> (Bonaparte et al., 1990) were clearly 
  much shorter than 66% of their humerus+radius length. <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i>' 
  was as well (63%) (Lambe, 1917). This is partially correlated with character 
  5. </p>
<p>13. This character (penultimate manual phalanges longest) is problematic, since 
  it does not specify digit II or III (they differ in e.g. <i>Dilophosaurus</i>). 
  The Montmirat specimen is coded as having elongate phalanges based on digit 
  III, but <i>Gorgosaurus</i> is coded the same way based on digit II. Digit III 
  is used here, since that allows the Montmirat specimen to be coded. In this 
  case, <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> should be coded as having short penultimate 
  phalanges, since III-3 is shorter than III-1 (Sereno, 1993). <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  (Gilmore, 1920) and <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> (Bonaparte et al., 1990) are both 
  unknown due to preserving incomplete digit IIIs, while <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> 
  is unknown due to lacking phalanges on digit III (Lambe, 1917).<br>
</p>
<p>14. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has an elongate metacarpal I (64-67% of metacarpal 
  II), while <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> has a short one (49%) (Welles, 1984). 
  <i> <b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> is polymorphic (49-67%) (Lambe, 1917; Matthew and 
  Brown, 1923).</p>
<p>15. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has a straight metacarpal I (Sereno, 1993), while 
  that of <i> <b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> was not illustrated in dorsal or ventral 
  view (Lambe, 1917) so cannot be coded. <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> (Osmolska et 
  al., 1972) has a bowed metacarpal I, though this appears less extreme due to 
  its great length.</p>
<p>16. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has a short contact between metacarpals I and II (Sereno, 
  1993), while <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i>' is uncertain due to disarticulation 
  (Bonaparte et al., 1990). The condition in <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> is not 
  described or illustrated (Lambe, 1917). <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i>' contact appears 
  long, but is short relative to metacarpal I (Osmolska et al., 1972). <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' 
  is also shorter than half the length of metacarpal I (Ostrom, 1969).</p>
<p>17. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> has an elongate metacarpal III (107-112% of metacarpal 
  II), but <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> has a short one (78%) (Bonaparte et al., 
  1990). <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' is long (93%) (Ostrom, 1969).</p>
<p>18. This character is a composite of metacarpal III slenderness and bowing, 
  with both states needing to be present to code a taxon as apomorphic. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> 
  lacks a bowed metacarpal III (Sereno, 1993). <i>Gorgosaurus</i> is coded as 
  inapplicable, but its metacarpal III width and bowing can still hypothetically 
  be measured even though Lambe (1917) does not indicate its state. It is corrected 
  to be uncertain. The character is a useless autapomorphy in any case, only being 
  present in <i>Deinonychus</i>.</p>
<p>19. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> lacks much overlap between metacarpals II and III 
  (Sereno, 1993), as does <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> (Osmolska et al., 1972) and 
  <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> (Ostrom, 1969). The condition is uncertain in the 
  <b>Montmirat</b> specimen without metacarpal II preserved. <i>Gorgosaurus</i> 
  is coded as inapplicable, but its metacarpal III placement relative to II could 
  hypothetically be scored, though it is disarticulated in the described specimen 
  (Lambe, 1917). It is corrected to be uncertain.</p>
<p>20. <i>Herrerasaurus</i>' manual phalanx III-3 is 51-52% of the length of III-1+III-2 
  (Sereno, 1993). This is correlated with character 13, so <i>Herrerasaurus</i> 
  is kept coded as unknown since it lacks elongate penultimate phalanges at all.</p>
<p>21. This character is scored as present in every coded taxon, making it useless. 
  Sereno (1999) codes herrerasaurids (and thus <i>Herrerasaurus</i> itself, since 
  other taxa lack manual material) as having ventrally rounded and narrow manual 
  unguals. He also codes ceratosaurs sensu lato this way, but it is uncertain 
  which genus of coelophysoid it is based on. The manual unguals of <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> 
  are too damaged to determine their cross section (Lambe, 1917). Kobayashi (2004) 
  codes <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> as having ventrally flattened manual unguals, 
  so it is recoded.</p>
<p>22. Contra Perez-Moreno et al., <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i>' manual unguals 
  seem narrower ventrally than dorsally (Welles, 1984). <i>Herrerasaurus</i>' 
  are coded as being wider ventrally (Azuma and Currie, 2000). <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i>' 
  manual unguals are too poorly preserved to determine their comparative dorsal 
  and ventral width (Lambe, 1917). </p>
<p>24. <i>Herrerasaurus</i> lacks a cuppedicus fossa (Novas, 1993). This is also 
  true in <b><i>Carnotaurus</i></b> (Bonaparte et al., 1990), <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  (Benson and Xu, 2008) and <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (Benson and Xu, 2008).</p>
<p>25. <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> (Sadlier et al., 2008) and <i>Gallimimus</i> 
  (Osmolska et al., 1972) have deep brevis fossae, while <i>Deinonychus</i> has 
  a shelf-like one (Clark et al., 2002).</p>
<p>26. Assuming Perez-Moreno's &quot;well-developed&quot; supracetabular shelf 
  refers to one which overhangs the acetabulum laterally, it is also present in 
  <i> <b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> (Novas, 1993), <i><b>Piatnitzkysaurus</b></i> (Bonaparte, 
  1986), <i><b>Eustreptospondylus</b></i> (Sadlier et al., 2008) and <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> 
  (Osmolska et al., 1973), but absent in <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> (Gilmore, 
  1920).</p>
<p>27. <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> (87-94%) (Gilmore, 1920), <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> 
  (95-105%) (Lambe, 1917; Matthew and Brown, 1923; Larson, 2008), <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> 
  (98-103%) (Osmolska et al., 1972; Kobayashi, 2004) and <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> 
  (86-97%) (Ostrom, 1969; Ostrom, 1976) each have ilia as long as that of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Carnotaurus</i>. </p>
<p>28. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> has a pubic peduncle which is longer than wide 
  (Gilmore, 1920), as do <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> (Bonaparte et al., 1986), <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  (Sadlier et al., 2008) and <i>Gallimimus</i> (Osmolska et al., 1972). </p>
<p>29. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i>' condition regarding the ventral extent of the 
  pubic peduncle is uncertain due to fusion (Gilmore, 1920).</p>
<p>31. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> lacks a pubic foot, as instead the pubic shaft 
  is flattened and twisted (Langer and Benton, 2006). <i>Ceratosaurus</i> has 
  a pubic foot (Britt et al., 2000), though the amount of anterior expansion is 
  not yet reported. The third character state is having an anteriorly reduced 
  foot, but since the outgroup shares this morphology, the character is better 
  recoded as anterior foot and posterior foot developed being the most derived 
  state. In that case, <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Gorgosaurus</i> are the only taxa 
  coded as having an elongate anterior foot, since the pubic feet of <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i>, 
  <i> <b>Piatnitzkysaurus</b></i> and <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> only appear to 
  be elongate anteriorly due to their angle with the pubic shaft.</p>
<p>32. Perez-Moreno et al.'s states are disjunct, as 0 is 75% or more and 1 is 
  66% or less. Yet some taxa such as <i>Dilophosaurus</i> have intermediate lengths 
  (ischium 70% of pubic length). The 0 state is changed to 67% or more, which 
  accurately reflects the codings. <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> has a long ischium 
  (79%) (Sadlier et al., 2008). The apomorphic state is only present in <i>Deinonychus</i>, 
  making the character useless. </p>
<p>33. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> has a obturator foramen in its pubis (Tykoski, 
  2005), Welles' earlier reconstruction being plaster. <i><b>Eustreptospondylus</b></i> 
  lacks an obturator foramen (Sadlier et al., 2008). The proximal plate of <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' 
  pubis is unpreserved in described specimens (Ostrom, 1976). </p>
<p>34. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> has a (open) pubic fenestra (Tykoski, 2005), 
  but <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> lacks one (Bonaparte et al., 1990). <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  also lacks one (Sadlier et al., 2008). Again, the condition in <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> 
  is unknown (Ostrom, 1976).</p>
<p>35. This character (depth of puboischial contact) is directly correlated with 
  the next (obturator process present), since the process forms by the absence 
  of a proximal plate that contacts the pubis. It is thus deleted and all nine 
  taxa recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>36. This character is a composite between obturator process presence and the 
  proximodistal placement of that process. <i>Deinonychus</i> is the only taxon 
  coded as having a distally placed process, making that state useless. <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  has a proximally placed obturator process (Sadlier et al., 2008).</p>
<p>37. <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> has a dorsally directed femoral head (Bonaparte 
  et al., 1990). <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' is slightly ventrally directed if 
  anything (Ostrom, 1976). </p>
<p>38. <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> has a reduced fourth trochanter (Bonaparte et 
  al., 1990). <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> has a large fourth trochanter (Lambe, 
  1917).</p>
<p>39. This character is a composite of anterior trochanter shape and position. 
  Contrary to Perez-Moreno, <i>Herrerasaurus</i> does have an anterior trochanter, 
  but it is only a low ridge (Novas, 1993). Its coding of 0 is retained though, 
  as it is less developed than other included taxa. <b><i>Dilophosaurus</i></b>' 
  morphology varies between a knob, spike and wing-like (Tykoski, 2005), so is 
  recoded 0+1+2. <i> <b>Ceratosaurus, Carnotaurus</b></i> and <i><b>Eustreptospondylus</b></i> 
  have winglike anterior trochanters placed beyond the distal margin of the femoral 
  head (Gilmore, 1920; Madsen and Welles, 2000). <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> has 
  a conical anterior trochanter (Ostrom, 1976).</p>
<p>40. The trochanteric shelf of <i>Ceratosaurus</i> is not better developed than 
  that of <i>Herrerasaurus</i> (Tykoski, 2005), so state 1 is deleted and all 
  trochanteric shelves are scored 0. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> is rescored 0+2 
  since some individuals lack the shelf (Britt et al., 2000). <i><b>Carnotaurus</b></i> 
  (Bonaparte et al., 1990) and <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> (Sadlier et al., 2008) 
  are rescored as 2.</p>
<p>41. <i>Herrerasaurus</i>' coding of 0 is maintained, although it has a possibly 
  homologous fossa placed laterally (Novas, 1993). Older <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  individuals have an anterodistal femoral fossa (Tykoski, 2005), though young 
  individuals of coelophysoids lack it. The fossae of <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i>, 
  <i> <b>Gallimimus</b></i> and <i><b>Gorgosaurus</b></i> are not noticably more 
  oval than the other taxa (<i>Gallimimus</i>' is straight-edged proximally and 
  <i>Gorgosaurus</i>' is schematic), so those taxa are recoded with state 1. <i>Deinonychus</i> 
  lacks a prominent fossa (Ostrom, 1976), as is typical of maniraptorans.</p>
<p>42. <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> (Welles, 1984) has a femoral extensor groove 
  of comparable depth to <i>Eustreptospondyus</i> (Sadlier et al., 2008), so is 
  coded 1 as well. Ezcurra and Novas (2006) code <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> and 
  <i> <b>Carnotaurus</b></i> as having a shallow groove, but Tykoski and Rowe 
  (2004) code them as lacking one. The former coding is followed here, as Ezcurra 
  and Novas also describe <i>Ceratosaurus</i> as having a planar surface similar 
  to <i>Dilophosaurus</i>', while Tykoski and Rowe code <i>Dilophosaurus</i> as 
  0. <i><b>Piatnitzkysaurus</b></i> is tentatively recoded as having a deep groove, 
  following Smith et al. (2007). <i>Deinonychus</i> has either a shallow or absent 
  groove (Ostrom, 1976).</p>
<p>43. The condition of the tibiofibular sulcus in <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i> cannot 
  be determined from the available figures (Osmolska et al., 1972).</p>
<p>44. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> is coded as having a well separated lateral 
  tibial condyle by Rauhut (2003) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), so is tentatively 
  recoded. The figure of <i>Gorgosaurus</i> in Lambe (1917) has an indistinct 
  condyle, though it does appear somewhat schematic. As Carr (2005) codes several 
  <i>Gorgosaurus</i> specimens as having the character, the coding of 1 is retained. 
  <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> is coded as lacking a well separated condyle by Senter 
  (2007), so is tentatively recoded. </p>
<p>45. <i><b>Gallimimus</b></i>' fibular crest is distally placed (Osmolska et 
  al., 1972) as is <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i>' (Ostrom, 1969).</p>
<p>46. This character is a composite between the height of the astragalar ascending 
  process and the depth of its facet on the tibia. <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> has 
  a low ascending process and shallow facet (Sadlier et al., 2008). </p>
<p>47. Older <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> specimens have a concave proximomedial 
  fibula (Tykoski, 2005). <i>Deinonychus</i> has a shallow medial fibular fossa 
  (Turner et al., 2007).</p>
<p>48. This correlated with character 47, as only taxa with a concave proximomedial 
  fibula can have a grooved structure there. As noted above, mature <i><b>Dilophosaurus</b></i> 
  specimens have a proximomedial fibular groove (Rauhut, 2003). Thus <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> 
  should be coded as unknown, as it lacks any concavity. The condition in <i><b>Deinonychus</b></i> 
  is undescribed.</p>
<p>49. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> has a small anterolateral surface on its astragalar 
  ascending process which contacted the fibula (Novas, 1989; Novas, 1993). <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> 
  lacks this character (Sadlier et al., 2008), while <i><b>Allosaurus</b></i> 
  has it (Madsen, 1976). </p>
<p>50. <i><b>Herrerasaurus</b></i> actually has a metarsotibial ratio of 48-54%, 
  so is recoded as polymorphic. </p>
<p>51. State 1 here (proximal exposure of metatarsal III enlarged) is only present 
  in <i>Ceratosaurus</i> in the matrix, so is a useless autapomorphy. It is combined 
  with state 0 (proximal exposure unreduced), and proximal exposure reduced is 
  made into state 1.</p>
<p>52. This is a composite character involving the proximal extent of metatarsal 
  I and the comparative lengths of pedal digits II and IV. As state 2 (involving 
  pedal digit length) is only present in <i>Deinonychus</i>, it is deleted and 
  <i>Deinonychus</i> is recoded as 1 due to its reduced metatarsal I. <i><b>Ceratosaurus</b></i> 
  and <i><b>Eustreptospondylus</b></i> have reduced metatarsals I as shown by 
  the articular surface on metatarsal II (Gilmore, 1920; Sadlier et al., 2008). 
  <b> <i>Gallimimus</i></b> cannot be coded, as it lacks metatarsal I entirely 
  (Osmolska et al., 1972). </p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This analysis is hindered by being only 
  based on appendicular characters, as examining the complete anatomy will generate 
  better results. At least eight characters are useless autapomorphies of single 
  taxa, many of which only serve to obscure their actual relationships since they 
  are multistate characters. For instance, <i>Ceratosaurus</i> is the only taxon 
  scored as having an enlarged proximal surface of metatarsal III (state 1), but 
  would truly be grouped with the taxa scored as having an unreduced proximal 
  surface (state 0) instead of a reduced one (state 2). One character is even 
  coded the same for every taxon. At least six characters are composites of two 
  or more features, and another six are correlated with other characters. One 
  good aspect is that this is the first analysis with multistate characters, but 
  only seven of the thirteen multistate characters are coded usefully, as the 
  other six have only one taxon coded with the most derived state. There were 
  a good number of miscodings, probably partially due to the codings being based 
  mostly on the literature, but also because several recent redescriptions (<i>Herrerasaurus</i>, 
  <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i> in particular) were not published 
  yet. All considered 143/572 (25%) of characters were miscoded. When corrected, 
  the strict consensus of seven trees is far less resolved. </p>

  sister taxa and have varying relationships to the others. </p>
<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Perez-Moreno et al.'s original 
  matrix, and their recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is 
  already most parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it.</p>

<p>Both the original matrix and the recoded version are basically ambiguous in 
  regard to the monophyly of Ceratosauria sensu lato and Neoceratosauria. While 
  the original matrix weakly rejects a basalmost tetanurine or eustreptospondyline 
  position for <i>Piatnitzkysaurus</i>, moderately rejects a carnosaurian position 
  and strongly rejects an abelisaurian position, the recoded matrix only weakly 
  rejects all of these. Similarly, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> is moderately rejected 
  as a carnosaur originally, but only weakly rejected with recoding. Alternative 
  avetheropod rearrangements with <i>Gorgosaurus</i> as a carnosaur or a Maniraptoriformes 
  excluding tyrannosaurs are basically ambiguous in both matrices. Both versions 
  do strongly reject a traditional coelurosaur-carnosaur dichotomy for Theropoda 
  though. In conclusion, after recoding, Perez-Moreno et al.'s matrix cannot usefully 
  reject any plausible topology.<br>
