<p>This paper described Iberomesornis, a new bird that was seen as intermediate 
  between Archaeopteryx and more derived taxa. It included a small phylogenetic 
  analysis thats sole purpose seemed to be to establish that fact.</p>
<p><b>Phylogeny</b>-</p>
<pre>|--coelurosaurs and deinonychosaurs
`--+--Archaeopteryx
   `--+--Iberomesornis
      `--Ornithurae
</pre>
<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Coelurosaurs and deinonychosaurs- As recognized now, Coelurosauria includes 
  Deinonychosauria. The authors never specify which taxa they use to code this 
  OTU from, so all coelurosaurs recognized as such before the 90's are used.<br>
  Ornithurae- Sanz and Bonaparte use Ornithurae in the sense of Cracraft (1986), 
  so presumably include Hesperornithes, <i>Ichthyornis</i> and Aves. Whether they 
  also include Enantiornithes is never explicitly stated, but they seem to since 
  Lecho enantiornithines have their ornithurine characters when known. They are 
  here excluded for simplicity's sake.</p>
<p><b>Character Issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i>Ichthyornis</i> and other ornithurines do have neural spines on their 
  cervicals (e.g. Clarke, 2004), though they are very low in some vertebrae. Similarly, 
  the first three preserved cervicals in <i>Iberomesornis</i> probably have low 
  spines that are simply not exposed. Many <b>coelurosaurs</b> such as <i>Oviraptor</i> 
  have low neural spines as well, so that clade is recoded as polymorphic. The 
  spines of <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> are also low (Wellnhofer, 1974), so it 
  is recoded as derived.</p>
<p>2. This character (tall dorsal neural arches) was intended as an autapomorphy 
  of <i>Iberomesornis</i>, making it useless for the analysis. It seems primarily 
  true of the first two dorsals, as the others do not differ noticeably from <i>Archaeopteryx</i> 
  in neural arch height. </p>
<p>3. Fused cervical ribs are known in several <b>coelurosaurs</b> (e.g. ornithomimids- 
  Ostrom, 1916;<i> Avimimus</i>- Kurzanov, 1987; <i>Velociraptor</i>- Norell et 
  al., 2006), so that OTU is recoded as polymorphic. While Sereno (2000) reported 
  no actual cervical ribs are preserved in <i>Iberomesornis</i>, he did state 
  the broken anterior area of the cervical vertebrae may indicate fused ribs were 
  present.</p>
<p>4. Cervicodorsal hypapophyses are present in several <b>coelurosaurs</b> (e.g. 
  <i>Ornitholestes</i>- Makovicky, 1995; <i>Avimimus</i>- Kurzanov, 1987; <i>Deinonychus</i>- 
  Norell and Makovicky, 1999), so they are recoded as polymorphic. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> 
  also has large hypapophyses (Sereno, 2000).</p>
<p>5. Some <b>coelurosaurs</b> such as oviraptorid IGM 100/42 have as few as ten 
  dorsal vertebrae (pers. obs.), so they are recoded as polymorphic (0+2). </p>
<p>6. This character (sacral number) is problematic because <b><i>Iberomesornis</i></b> 
  has eight sacrals (Sereno, 2000), not five as originally supposed. Thus it is 
  intermediate between coelurosaurs and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (5-7) and ornithurines 
  (10-23). It is here coded as apomorphic because defining the character as &quot;8 
  or more sacrals&quot; will make it informative, whereas if it is defined as 
  &quot;10 or more sacrals&quot; it becomes a useless autapomorphy of Ornithurae 
  (as originally designed).</p>
<p>7. This character (sacral hypapophyses) was originally a useless autapomorphy 
  of <i>Iberomesornis</i>, but also based on a mistake. The anterior sacrals of 
  the specimen are in lateral view but incorrectly thought to be in ventral view 
  by Sanz and Bonaparte, so what they saw as hypapophyses are actually sacral 
  ribs (Sereno, 2000). <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> is thus recoded 0.</p>
<p>9. <b>Ornithurae</b> is polymorphic for the presence of caudal zygapophyses, 
  since <i>Ichthyornis</i> has them (Clarke, 2004).</p>
<p>10. Several <b>coelurosaurs</b> have ossified uncinate processes (e.g. IGM 
  100/42- Clark et al., 2002; <i>Deinonychus</i>- Paul, 2002; <i>Velociraptor</i>- 
  Paul, 2002), so the OTU is recoded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>11. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> is here considered too incomplete to rule out 
  the possibility it had gastralia.</p>
<p>13. This is a composite character combining interclavicular angle with the 
  presence of a hypocleidium. Among <b>Ornithurae</b>, <i>Hesperornis</i> has 
  a wide interclavicular angle and no hypocleidium (Marsh, 1880), <i>Ichthyornis</i> 
  has a narrow angle and no hypocleidium (Clarke, 2004), and Aves generally have 
  narrow angles but vary in their hypocleidium size. Similarly, <b>coelurosaurs</b> 
  always have broad furculae, but vary in their hypocleidium size. Thus both taxa 
  are recoded as polymorphic.</p>
<p>14. <b>Ornithurae</b> is recoded as polymorphic for ulnohumeral ratio, as <i>Baptornis</i> 
  has a ratio of 18% (Martin and Tate, 1976) and <i>Ichthyornis</i> one of 94% 
  (Clarke, 2004) (compare to 87-96% for <i>Archaeopteryx</i>).</p>
<p>15. <b>Coelurosaurs</b> are coded as polymorphic for pelvic fusion, as some 
  exhibit it (e.g. <i>Ornithomimus</i>- Parks, 1926; <i>Avimimus</i>- Kurzanov, 
  1987). The condition in <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> is uncertain. Sanz et al. 
  (2002) and Chiappe (1996) state no puboischial suture is visible, but Sereno 
  (2000) illustrates such a suture. It is here recoded as unknown.</p>
<p>16. While the pubis of <i>Iberomesornis</i> is not propubic as hypothesized 
  by Sanz and Bonaparte, it is not subparallel to the ilium either (Sereno, 2000). 
  It is thus retained as plesiomorphic.</p>
<p>17. <i>Iberomesornis</i> has fused distal tarsals, the free tarsals identified 
  by Sanz and Bonaparte being part of the tarsometatarsus that was separated from 
  the rest by a film of matrix (Sereno, 2000). Similarly, the astragalus and calcaneum 
  are fused to each other and the tibia (Sereno, 2000), Sanz and Bonaparte's description 
  of separate proximal tarsals being due to breakage. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> 
  is thus recoded. This is also true of <i>Avimimus</i> (Kurzanov, 1987), so <b>coelurosaurs</b> 
  are recoded as polymorphic. </p>
<p>18. Sereno (2000) showed the proximal tarsometatarsus of <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> 
  is actually fused anteriorly, contra Sanz and Bonaparte. The Maxburg and Solnhofen 
  <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens show metatarsal fusion (Wellnhofer, 1992), so 
  <i> <b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> is recoded. <b>Coelurosaurs</b> are again recoded 
  as polymorphic based on <i>Avimimus (</i>Kurzanov, 1987).</p>
<p>19. Middleton (2003) finds that <i><b>Archaeopteryx</b></i> lacks the twisted 
  metatarsal I needed for a reversed hallux, and finds <b><i>Iberomesornis</i></b> 
  to be too distorted for comparison.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This analysis is mostly problematic due 
  to its small size. With only four taxa included, it's more of a demonstration 
  of the characters uniting <i>Iberomesornis</i> with more derived birds than 
  a test of anything's relationships. This is proven by the perfect (1.00) consistancy 
  index, which shows every single character is consistant with the tree they present 
  (amusingly, this is even true of the recoded matrix). Most of the other issues 
  are due to misinterpretation of <i>Iberomesornis</i>, or assuming coelurosaurs 
  have the primitive state when they are polymorphic for 8 (42%) of the 19 characters. 
  All together, 23/76 (30%) of the characters are miscoded. When corrected, the 
  tree is unsurprisingly basically the same-</p>

<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Sanz and Bonaparte's original 
  matrix, and his recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is already 
  most parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it.</p>

<p>The only other possible arrangement of the matrix is to support Sauriurae, 
  which was moderately rejected by the original matrix but only weakly rejected 
  by the recoded version. The matrix is too small to usefully test any hypothesis, 
  despite its bias. </p>
