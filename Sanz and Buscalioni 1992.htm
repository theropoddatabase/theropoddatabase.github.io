<p>This paper described Sanz and Buscalioni's new bird <i>Concornis lacustris</i>, 
  which has since been redescribed (Sanz et al., 1995) as an enantiornithine. 
  It included a very small phylogenetic analysis.</p>
<p><b>Phylogeny</b></p>
<p>Sanz and Buscalioni illustrated a cladogram from an analysis that excluded 
  Enantiornithes and <i>Ambiortus</i>. Then they illustrated two more trees which 
  included those taxa, but differed in which was closer to Ornithurae.</p>

<p>However, the text indicates that when Enantiornithes and <i>Ambiortus</i> were 
  added, 36 most parsimonious trees resulted. Twenty-one of these had hesperornithines 
  as the most basal birds after <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, while many of the others 
  &quot;placed <i>Ambiortus</i> or the Enantiornithes in an unlikely branching.&quot; 
  Running the matrix though PAUP confirms that the true strict consensus tree 
  is a polytomy-</p>

<p><b>Taxon Issues</b></p>
<p>Non-avian theropods- Which theropods were used to code from is never specified.<br>
  Enantiornithes- <i>Iberomesornis</i> and <i>Concornis</i> were not yet recognized 
  as enantiornithines, but the authors did include the Lecho Formation material 
  (including <i>Enantiornis</i> and what would later be named <i>Lectavis</i>, 
  <i>Yungavolucris</i>, <i>Soroavisaurus</i> and <i>Martinavis pricei</i>), <i>Avisaurus</i> 
  and the at-the-time unnamed <i>Neuquenornis</i>.<br>
  Carinatae- This is based on Cracraft's use of the term, for <i>Ichthyornis</i> 
  and Aves. It is not at all certain this clade would exclude <i>Ambiortus</i> 
  or Hesperornithes.</p>
<p><b>Character Issues</b></p>
<p>1. <i>Ambiortus</i> has a slender radius (~50% of ulnar width; Kurochkin, 1999), 
  while <b>carinates</b> should be polymorphic since <i>Ichthyornis</i> has a 
  thick radius (72%; Clarke, 2004).</p>
<p>3. This is a composite character involving both intermetacarpal space width 
  and distal fusion between metacarpals II and III. They do not seem correlated, 
  as <i>Ichthyornis</i> has a narrow intermetacarpal space but distal fusion, 
  while many theropods have a broad intermetacarpal space and no fusion. Furthermore, 
  the authors' intermediate state for <i>Concornis</i> (metacarpals II and III 
  closely joined distally but not fused) is no longer seen in any taxon, since 
  <i> <b>Concornis</b></i> was later found to have distal fusion (Sanz et al., 
  1995). The intermediate state is deleted and only fusion is coded for. Contra 
  the authors, <i>Enantiornis</i> and <i>Neuquenornis</i> lack distal fusion (Chiappe 
  and Walker, 2002), so <b>Enantiornithes</b> is recoded. Whether <i><b>Ambiortus</b></i> 
  has distal fusion is unknown due to poor preservation (Kurochkin, 1999).</p>
<p>4. This is another composite character involving the number of phalanges on 
  manual digits II and III, the length of manual phalanges, and the presence of 
  manual unguals. They are not always correlated, as <i>Concornis</i> (Sanz et 
  al., 1995) and <i>Ichthyornis</i> (Clarke, 2004) are both now known to have 
  unguals, but short phalanges and a reduced number of phalanges in digit III. 
  Modern Aves also often have unguals on digits I or (more rarely) II (Fisher, 
  1940). <i><b>Concornis</b></i> and <b>Carinatae</b> are both rescored as polymorphic. 
  <i> <b>Ambiortus</b></i> is also scored polymorphic, as it has an ungual on 
  digit II at least, but also short phalanges like other derived birds (Kurochkin, 
  1999). With some minor partial exceptions (e.g. tyrannosaurids and <i>Compsognathus</i> 
  lacking more than one phalanx on digit III; <i>&quot;Ingenia&quot;</i> having 
  short phalanges), theropods known at the time show the plesiomorphic state, 
  so are still coded that way.<br>
  <br>
  6. <i>Avimimus</i> has a fully fused tibiotarsus with well developed distal 
  condyles (Kurzanov, 1987), so <b>theropods</b> are rescored as polymorphic. 
  Sereno (2000) determined <b><i>Iberomesornis</i></b> has a fully fused tibiotarsus 
  and that the prior identification of proximal tarsals was due to breakage.</p>
<p>7. This is a composite character involving both the distal divergence of metatarsals 
  II and IV and also the ginglymoidy of the metatarsals. New preparation reveals 
  the trochlea of <b><i>Concornis</i></b> to be in contact distally much like 
  <i>Iberomesornis</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx</i> (Sanz et al., 1995). Hesperornithines 
  like <i>Enaliornis</i> and <i>Baptornis</i> generally have highly transversely 
  compressed metatarsals, but metatarsal II is divergent posteriorly, so they 
  are retained as being apomorphic. Regarding ginglymoidy, many deinonychosaurs 
  (e.g. <i>Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus, Velociraptor, Troodon</i>) have ginglymoid 
  metatarsals II and/or III (e.g. Ostrom, 1969), so <b>theropods</b> are recoded 
  as polymorphic.</p>
<p>9. This character is confusing as it is called &quot;reversal of first digit 
  of foot&quot;, but the states are defined as the proximodistal placement of 
  the hallux. These are not correlated, as many deinonychosaurs have distally 
  placed but unreversed halluces. It is here coded as described in the states, 
  which leaves theropods as plesiomorphic since the basal paravians with distally 
  placed halluces had yet to be described. </p>
<p>10. <b>Hesperornithines</b> are recoded as polymorphic, as <i>Hesperornis</i> 
  has non-strut-like coracoids (Marsh, 1888). </p>
<p>11. This is another composite character, combining interclavicular angle with 
  the presence of a hypocleidium. Many taxa such as <i>Ichthyornis</i>, <i>Ambiortus</i> 
  and many Aves have a low angle but no hypocleidium (Clarke, 2004; Kurochkin, 
  1999). Thus <i><b>Ambiortus</b></i> and <b>Carinatae</b> are recoded as polymorphic. 
  Many theropods also have broad furculae with large hypocleidia, like oviraptorids 
  (Barsbold, 1983). <b>Theropods</b> are recoded as polymorphic due to this. <i>Neuquenornis</i> 
  has a low angle and hypocleidium (Chiappe and Calvo, 1994), so enantiornithines 
  are coded as being apomorphic. <i>Hesperornis</i> has a broad interclavicular 
  angle with no hypocleidium (Marsh, 1880), so <b>hesperornithines</b> are recoded 
  as plesiomorphic. </p>
<p>12. <i>Iberomesornis</i> had a sternal keel at least posteriorly (Sereno, 2000), 
  so is coded with an uncertainty polymorphy (state 1 or 2 present). Enantiornithines 
  are kept coded as having a fully developed keel based on <i>Neuquenornis</i>, 
  though it is ironic now that we know almost every other enantiornithine had 
  a posteriorly restricted one. </p>
<p>13. <i>Velociraptor</i> (Norell et al., 1997) has a sternum much longer than 
  its coracoids, so <b>theropods</b> are recoded as polymorphic. <i><b>Iberomesornis</b></i> 
  is unknown, as its anterior sternum is unpreserved (Sereno, 2000). A better 
  way to measure sterna should have been used, as taxa with strut-like coracoids 
  need much longer sterna to count for this character than taxa like non-avialan 
  theropods and <i>Archaeopteryx</i>.</p>
<p>14. <b>Enantiornithines</b> considered by Sanz and Buscalioni were not known 
  to have pygostyles, so they should be recoded as uncertain.</p>
<p><b>General analysis conclusions</b>- This analysis is mostly problematic for 
  being so small. In addition, 5 of the 14 (36%) characters are composites, though 
  at least none are correlated with other characters. One issue is that the trees 
  illustrated are not the trees found by the analysis. The main tree only exists 
  when two taxa are excluded, each of which has unique character combinations. 
  Even when those taxa are included, the authors ignore most of the trees based 
  on their preconceptions of what bird phylogeny should look like. If you're not 
  going to trust the analysis over your intuition, why bother running one at all? 
  In total, 22/112 (20%) of the states are miscoded. When corrected, the following 
  tree results.</p>
<pre>|--non-avian theropods
`--Aves
   |--Archaeopteryx
   |--Hesperornithes
   `--Euornithes
      |--Iberomesornis
      |--Concornis
      |--Enantiornithes
      |--Ambiortus

      `--Carinatae</pre>
<p>If <i>Ambiortus</i> and Enantiornithes are deleted a priori, as Sanz and Buscalioni 
  did to make their resolved tree, Euornithes consists of two clades- <i>Iberomesornis</i>+<i>Concornis</i> 
  and Hesperornithes+Carinatae. This is ironically the standard topology, though 
  given only these characters and taxa, <i>Ambiortus</i> and Enantiornithes disrupt 
  it.</p>
<p><b>Phylogenetic conclusions</b>- The table shows the number of extra steps 
  needed to accomodate each rearrangement using Sanz and Buscalioni's original 
  matrix, and his recoded matrix. A negative number means the arrangement is already 
  most parsimonious, but that many steps are needed to undo it.</p>

</table>
<p>Though the original matrix rejects Sauriurae with moderate support, the recoded 
  one only rejects it weakly. No plausible bird topology is rejected, as the matrix 
  is simply too small.</p>
<p><b>Experiments with controversial taxa</b>- A basal ornithurine such as <i>Confuciusornis</i> 
  may make Hesperornithes group with Carinatae instead of more basally. However, 
  adding <i>Confuciusornis</i> to the modified matrix leaves Hesperornithes basal 
  and <i>Confuciusornis</i> the sister taxon of Euornithes.</p>
