<b>Comments</b>- While Cope (1883) used Opisthocoela as an alternative
name for Sauropoda, it is actually a misspelling of Owen's (1860)
Opisthocoelia. As Opisthocoelia was erected to include not only <i>"Cetiosaurus"
medius</i> and <i>Pelorosaurus</i> but also the theropod <i>Streptospondylus</i>,
it is a better equivalent of Saurischia than Sauropoda. Tornier (1913)
used Diplodocia as an alternative name for Sauropoda. <br>

<b>"D. laticostalis"</b> Zhao, 1985<br>
?= "Damalasaurus magnus" Zhao, 1985<br>
<b>Etymology</b>- Named for Damala Mountain in Qamdo, with the species
referring to wide ribs (laticostalis) or large size (magnus).<br>
<b>Early Jurassic<br>
Middle Daye Group, Daye, Qamdo County, Tibet, China<br>
Material</b>- (~15 m) specimen including dorsal rib<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The species is listed as "magnus" in the text, but
"laticostalis" in the plate caption. Olshevsky (1991) listed
"laticostalis as the type, though I consider it probable only one
species is intended by Zhao since two are never present in faunal lists
together (Zhao and Cheng, 1985; Zhang and Li, 1997; Fang et al., 2006).
Fang et al. use "laticostalis" for the species, suggesting it is the
intended one since Zhao is a coauthor. Zhao (1985) includes a
photograph of a dorsal rib in situ, which the length estimate above is
taken from assuming proportions like <i>Barapasaurus</i>. Glut (1997)
incorrectly stated it is Middle Jurassic in age. Weishampel et al.
(2004) list this as an undescribed sauropod in their faunal list. <br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Stated by Zhao (1983, 1985) to be a primitive
sauropod. Chure and McIntosh (1989) listed it as a cetiosaurid, while
Lambert (1990) and Olshevsky (1991) listed it as a brachiosaurid. Glut
(1997) only listed it as Sauropoda incertae sedis. Fang et al. (2006)
place it in Cetiosauridae, noting again it's a primitive sauropod. As
those authors placing it in Brachiosauridae have never seen the
specimen, and brachiosaurids are currently unknown from Asia or the
Early Jurassic, that assignment seems less likely. Since Cetiosauridae
is currently viewed as a grade of basal eusauropods, "Damalosaurus" is
here placed as Sauropoda incertae sedis.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This name originally appeared in a guidebook, with the
taxon stated to be under study by Ouyang. Ouyang (2003) later mentioned
it in his thesis as a new genus, which he places in an eponymous
subfamily within Vulcanodontidae. As he also includes the more basal <i>Gongxianosaurus</i>
in Vulcanodontidae, Ouyang's conception of the family may be more of a
grade. Ouyang further notes the anterior dorsal neural spines are
transversely expanded, which he believes indicates a possible
relationship to taxa with bifurcated spines like <i>Datousaurus</i>.
As Ouyang states "Yibinosaurus" is from the same locality as <i>Gongxianosaurus</i>,
the dorsal vertebrae, 51 articulated caudal vertebrae, scapulae and
ilium mentioned by Luo and Wang (1999) as <i>Gongxianosaurus</i> sp.
nov. may be the "Yibinosaurus" material. <br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?(FMNH CUP 2042) maxilla (Barrett, 1999)<br>
?(IVPP coll.) tooth (Upchurch and Barrett, 2000)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The species name is spelled "wudingi" in the text, and
"utingensjs" in the figure caption, which as noted by Chure and
McIntosh (1989) are probably unintentional variants, and the latter no
doubt a mispelling of "utingensis". <br>
The skeleton was discovered by Su in 1954, but the dentaries were only
discovered later in 1960 and described and illustrated by Young (1966)
as specimens of <i>Lufengosaurus magnus</i>. Dong (1992) referred them
to the same individual as the postcrania since they came from the same
quarry. While Dong (and later Olshevsky, 2000) was incorrect in stating
Zhao described the taxon in 1985, his own book contains a diagnosis,
type and illustration so would seem to validate the nomenclature
(contra Barrett, 1999). Indeed, Upchurch et al. (2004) attribute the
name to Dong, 1992. A photo of part of the mounted skeleton is in Zhao
(1985), contra Barrett (1999). Dong et al. (1990) published a
photograph of the entire skeleton, and several are available online as
well. Li et al. (2010) note <i>Kunmingosaurus</i> lacks dorsal
pleurocoels and has a poorly developed fourth trochanter.<br>
Simmons (1965) described a maxilla (FMNH CUP 2042) from Ta Ti in the
same beds as <i>Yunnanosaurus robustus</i>, which is similar to <i>Kunmingosaurus</i>
in having a sauropodan lateral plate and serrated, spatulate teeth with
a lingual ridge. Barrett (1999) redescribed it as a sauropod maxilla,
though he did not refer it to any genus. Upchurch and Barrett (2000)
described a referred tooth. <br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Stated by Zhao (1985) to be a primitive sauropod.
Chure and McIntosh (1989) and Lambert (1990) listed it as a
cetiosaurid, while Olshevsky (1991) listed it provisionally as a
barapasaurid and Dong (1992) as a shunosaurine camarasaurid. Upchurch
and Barrett (2000) discussed it as a 'vulcanodontid', which was a grade
of basal sauropods in their scheme, and described a referred tooth.
Upchurch (1995) noted there was no published evidence suggesting it was
a vulcanodontid, however. He later (1998) noted that <i>Kunmingosaurus</i>'
teeth were more plesiomorphic than <i>Barapasaurus</i>, <i>Shunosaurus</i>,
<i>Patagosaurus</i> and other taxa in having only a shallow lingual
concavity and being quite labiolingually compressed. Barrett (1999)
considered the dentaries to be sauropod based on the dorsoventrally
expanded symphysis and lateral plate. Fang et al. (2006) list it as a
camarasaurid. <br>
When entered into a modified version of Wilson's (2002) analysis, <i>Kunmingosaurus</i>
emerges more derived than <i>Chinshakiangosaurus, Antetonitrus,
Lessemsaurus</i> and <i>Blikanasaurus</i> but less than eusauropods
(so is not a cetiosaurid, barapasaurid, shunosaurid or camarasaurid).
It is thus related to taxa such as <i>Gongxianosaurus, Kotasaurus,
Spinophorosaurus, Tazoudasaurus</i> and <i>Vulcanodon</i>, so may be
considered vulcanodont-grade. Note the results agree with Upchurch's
(1998) statements, though his dental characters were not used by
Wilson. Specifically, <i>Kunmingosaurus</i> is more derived than <i>Chinshakiangosaurus</i>
based on the D-shaped teeth and reduced fourth trochanter, but less
derived than <i>Shunosaurus</i> based on no crown-to-crown occlusion,
straight dorsal ilial margin and unreduced pedal phalanges. <br>

other avetheropod, and the fact the much later therizinosaur <i>Falcarius</i>
is nonetheless less derived in respect to serration size, dentary
curvature and the absence of a lateral dentary ridge. Most recently,
Barrett (2009) notes that basal sauropodomorphs lack the anteriorly
extensive well defined lateral dentary shelf, anteriorly increasing
tooth size, more than thirty dentary teeth, lingual cingulum on teeth,
apicobasally oriented lingual ridge on teeth, and tooth roots that
expand mesiodistally to equal crown width.<br>

?(MLP 36-XI-10-3/4) distal tibia (178 mm wide) (Casamiquela, 1963)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut, 2003) lateral walls of the neural
canal and centropostzygapophyseal laminae flared laterally posteriorly;
neural canal strongly flexed anteroposteriorly within the dorsal neural
arches.<br>
(after Carballido and Pol, 2010) spoon-shaped teeth with low SI values
(1.34-1.49); enamel wrinkled forming a pattern of pits and narrow
apicobasal sulci; absence of denticles in both mesial and distal
margins (also in <i>Kotasaurus</i> and <i>Shunosaurus</i>); wear
facets extending mostly along one margin of the crowns.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Cabrera (1947) listed several characters in his
diagnosis. The teeth were said to be similar to <i>Apatosaurus</i> (as
<i>Brontosaurus</i>), but comparatively larger. However, the supposed <i>Apatosaurus</i>
tooth cited by Cabrera is from <i>Camarasaurus</i>, so was not
correctly associated with the <i>Apatosaurus</i> postcrania. In
addition, which postcrania the <i>Amygdalodon</i> teeth belonged to is
unknown. Apneumatic dorsal centra with pleurofossae are primitive. A
pubis "similar to atlantosaurids" is vague, but may indicate the
straight anterior margin noted in the text to be more like <i>Apatosaurus</i>
than <i>Cetiosauriscus</i> (as <i>Cetiosaurus leedsi</i>) or <i>Camarasaurus</i>.
A straight pubic shaft is also found in taxa such as <i>Tazoudasaurus</i>
however. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Piatnitzky discovered the referred material in 1936
and mentioned it that year, though it was not described until
Casamiquela did so in 1963. The type material was collected in 1936 and
described the following year by Cabrera as a new taxon of cetiosaurid.
Cabrera (1947) identified the dorsal neural spine as a caudal neural
spine, while Casamiquela (1963) believed it was a dorsal diapophysis.
The flat fragment has been identified as part of a scapula (Cabrera,
1947) and dorsal rib (Casamiquela, 1963), but Rauhut (2003) felt it
didn't match any sauropod element and placed it as Reptilia indet..
Camasiquela identified the sacral centrum as a caudal centrum. The
material was found in one area, but belongs to at least three
individuals, with the cervical prezygapophysis largest, the dorsals
medium sized, and the sacral smallest. Which individuals the other
material belongs to is unknown, though there are at least two sizes of
dorsal ribs. Whether all of the material belongs to the same taxon is
unknown, though it is all congruent with a basal sauropod. <br>
Carballido and Pol (2010) recently found this taxon to be a sauropod
more derived than <i>Chinshakiangosaurus</i> but outside Gravisauria
based on a version of Wilson's analysis. Lang's (2008) unpublished
thesis finds it to be a shunosaurid though. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Unfortunately, the description of "Pulanesaura" has no
mention of ZooBank and as of July 5
2020 it lacks an entry on the ZooBank webite.  Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), "Pulanesaura eocollum" McPhee et
al., 2015 is a nomen nudum that may never be technically
valid
as its journal is not published physically.<br>
McPhee et al. (2015) recovered "Pulanesaura" as sister to
vulcanodontids+gravisaurians using a version of Yates' matrix.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Upchurch (1995) erected Eusauropoda for his clade
containing euhelopodids and neosauropods, but not <i>Vulcanodon</i> or
<i>Barapasaurus</i>. This makes the explicit inclusion of <i>Barapasaurus</i>
in Salgado et al.'s definition problematic. While both Upchurch et
al.'s and Wilson and Sereno's definitions have similar current content,
only the former equates to Eusauropoda in Upchurch's 1995 topology, so
is preferred here.<br>
Janensch (1929) erected Bothrosauropodidae (which is invalid, as there
is no genus Bothrosauropus) for cetiosaurines, camarasaurines and
brachiosaurines. <br>

“Complexo Vale de Lagares” (Teixeira et al., 1968) that corresponds to
the Alcobaça Formation, Kimmeridgian to basal Tithonian in age." 
Mocho et al. (2017) later stated it was "probably from the Bombarral

= "Lanchangjiangosaurus" Fang, Zhang, Lu, Han, Zhao and Li, 2006<br>
<b>"L. cachuensis"</b> Zhao, 1985<br>
<b>Etymology</b>- The genus references the Lancang Jiang, the local
name for the head of the Mekong River. The species name refers to the
Zaqu River, which is the upper reaches of the Mekong.<br>
<b>Middle Jurassic<br>
Middle Dapuka Group, Dabuka, Qamdo County, Tibet, China<br>
Material</b>- (~15 m) specimen including skull, mandible, twelve teeth
and limb elements<br>
specimen (Fang et al., 2006)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Though usually believed to be a preliminary name for <i>Datousaurus</i>
(e.g. Olshevsky, 1991), "Lancangosaurus" was first reported by Zhao
(1980) in relation to a Dapuka specimen, not the Xiashaximiao <i>Datousaurus</i>.
Listed characters are large skull, large spatulate teeth which decrease
gradually in size posteriorly, a thick mandible and robust limbs. Dong
et al. (1983) believed the teeth were congeneric with those from the
Wujiaba Quarry of the Shangshaximiao Formation, which they described as
belonging to <i>Omeisaurus junghsiensis</i> and <i>O. fuxiensis</i>.
Zhao (1985) figures teeth in situ, though the photograph is unclear.
Note Olshevsky (1991) switched the authorship for the variants
"Lancanjiangosaurus" and "Lancangjiangosaurus". Glut (1997) incorrectly
listed it as being Late Jurassic in age. Fang et al. (2006) note
additional material from lower in the same formation. Given the
etymology, either "Lancangosaurus" or "Lancangjiangosaurus" would be
the most accurate names.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- "Lancanjiangosaurus" was stated by Zhao (1983) to
be a bothrosauropodoid, in which he includes spatulate-toothed taxa
like camarasaurids and brachiosaurids. Zhao (1985) notes it is a
sauropod similar to <i>Cetiosaurus</i>. Chure and McIntosh (1989)
listed it as a cetiosaurid, as does Olshevsky (1991) provisionally,
while Lambert (1990) listed it as a brachiosaurid. Glut (1997) merely
referred it to Sauropoda incertae sedis. Most recently, Fang et al.
(2006) place it in Cetiosauridae. The known characters are found in
both basal eusauropods like <i>Omeisaurus</i> and camarasaurids,
though the age, locality and Zhao's opinion all favor the former
identification. Whether Dong et al. are correct in placing it close to <i>Omeisaurus</i>
is unknown, and for now I recommend keeping it as Eusauropoda incertae
sedis.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 1982
and excavated in 1984.  Olshevsky (1991) lists "Klamelisaurus
gobiensis" as a euhelopodid (in a sense including mamenchisaurs) "to be
described by Zhao C. C. from the Late Jurassic of the Dzungar Basin,
Xinjiang; known from a skeleton about 80% complete; SVP Bulletin
#149:45."  <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus</span>
was officially described by Zhao (1993) as a brachiosaurid sensu lato
closest to camarasaurines but different enough to be in a monotypic
subfamily.  Moore et al. (2020) redescribed <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus</span>
in depth, reporting some elements could not be located, others were
newly reported, the reported manual elements were pedal, and much of
the material was reconstructed making assessment of the original
anatomy impossible.  Moore et al. recovered it as a euhelopodid
(including mamenchisaurs, almost always outside Neosauropoda) closest
to, and sometimes nested within, <span style="font-style: italic;">Mamenchisaurus</span>.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Kelmayisaurus </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">"gigantus</span>"- Grady (1993) wrote about
visiting the Wucaiwan Formation of Xinjiang in
1987, stating "A few years earlier, Dale [Russell] noted in his field
book, a <span style="font-style: italic;">Kelmayisaurus gigantus</span>,
a huge theropod measuring twenty-one meters from neck to tailtip (there
was no skull) had been found there."  Olshevsky (DML, 1995)
reported
that "Dale says he's never heard of it", suggesting a misunderstanding
by Grady.  A plausible solution was suggested by Greenfield
(online, 2021) that Russell's field book was referring to the sauropod <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus gobiensis</span>, whose
skull-less holotype was excavated from that formation in 1984. 
The confusion in names could be due to the fact <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus</span>
was only officially published in April 1993, although the name
"Klamelisaurus gobiensis" had been unofficially proposed since at least
June 1990 (Olshevsky, 1991) so could have been in Russell's field book
and misinterpreted by Grady as a similar genus and species name. 
Finally, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Klamelisaurus</span>'
holotype was only estimated to be 17 meters by Zhao (1993) once
described, the anterior cervicals and distal caudals were not
preserved, so Russell's 21 meter report wouldn't be unreasonable
especially when done prior to the official description.<br>

assigned it to a new neosauropod family, but preliminary analyses
suggest it may be related to near-neosauropod taxa like <i>Jobaria</i>
and <i>Cetiosaurus</i> instead. The caudal series is only tentatively
referred because it was associated with MB.R.2091.31.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Mateus et al., 2014) posterior margin of
scapula just proximal to blade at an abrupt angle (~110 degrees) to
proximalmost posterior margin of scapular blade; humerus expands both
anteriorly and posteriorly at the distal half of the deltopectoral

far anteriorly as the rest of the distal end; manual ungual I
subrectangular in lateral view.<br>
<b> Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1996 and initially
referred to <i>Turiasaurus riodevensis</i> in an abstract (Mateus,
2009) before being described as a new taxon (Mateus et al., 2014).
However, the seven distinguishing characters listed by the latter
authors are only determinable in the holotypes of each species. As <i>Turiasaurus</i>
is only slightly later (Middle-Late Tithonian) and also from the
Iberian peninsula, it seems plausible the taxa are synonymous, though
this will require further comparable material to test. <br>

All modern authors have considered it an indeterminate sauropod, though
as Barrett et al. (2002) note, the absence of a well-developed
proximolateral humeral process excludes it from Somphospondyli. The
Cretaceous age may indicate it is a neosauropod.<br>

He said it was a carnosaurian middle caudal vertebra and
"most probably belong to the same species."  Noting only the
subequal height and width (130 mm vs. 135 mm), his description was
surpassed by Benson and Xu (2008) who
stated it "has a stout and only weakly constricted centrum with
subrectangular articular surfaces, and the broken attachments of the
neural arch show that the latter was narrow."  They said this
suggests "that the centrum belongs to a sauropod and should be
considered Sauropoda indet. (O.W.M.Rauhut, pers. comm.)".  Indeed,
