<p>Sereno et al. 2011</p>
<p>2. external naris size large, expanded narial margin.</p>
<p>The plesiomorphic state specifies a tapered snout, but some taxa coded 0 like 
  Herrerasaurus, Eodromaeus and Ceratosaurus certainly don't have tapered snouts. 
  If you measure Eoraptor's naris compared to its skull length, then yes it looks 
  large. But that's because it has a short snout. If you measure naris length 
  compared to some more neutral value such as skull height at the orbit, its naris 
  is actually smaller than any other taxon in the matrix. Also, Panphagia does 
  not preserve a premaxilla, so cannot be coded, contra the matrix.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>19. nasal posterolateral process present.</p>
<p>This is actually unknown in silesaurids and Tawa (Nesbitt et al., 2009), though 
  Panphagia has it (Martinez and Alcober, 2009). It is also present in Coelophysis 
  (Downs, 2000), Megapnosaurus (Downs, 2000), &quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae (Tykoski,k 
  1998). This makes it a eusaurischian character, not a sauropodomorph one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>24. squamosal, ventral process a slender prong 3 or more times basal width.</p>
<p>This is actually present in Silesaurus (Dzik and Sulej, 2007), Lesothosaurus 
  (Sereno, 1991), Saturnalia (Langer and Benton, 2006), &quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae 
  (Tykoski, 1998) and Coelophysis (Colbert, 1989). It is polymorphic in Sauropodiformes 
  because one of Sereno et al.'s two examplars (Massospondylus- Sues et al., 2004) 
  lacks it. The condition in Megapnosaurus is unknown (Raath, 1977).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>45. dentary tooth 1 inset.</p>
<p>Oddly, silesaurids are coded as inapplicable, even though this is one of their 
  distinctive characters. If anything ornithischians should be coded unknown, 
  in case their predentary is homologous to the anterior dentary. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>43. maxillary and dentary crowns lanceolate.</p>
<p>As noted above, there's no difference between Sereno et al.'s triangular and 
  lanceolate shapes, as can be seen by the near identical shape of the supposed 
  triangular tooth of Silesaurus (Dzik, 2003 fig. 5H) and the supposed lanceolate 
  tooth of Panphagia (Martinez and Alcober, 2006 fig. 5B). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>69. deltopectoral crest 45% or more of humeral length.</p>
<p>Eoraptor's crest has previously been reported to be 35% of humeral length (Langer 
  and Benton, 2006). Genasaurs' should be polymorphic, since Scutellosaurus (Colbert, 
  1964) has a short crest. Ceratosaurus also has a short crest (Galton, 1982).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>76. manus phalanx I-1, rotation of axis through distal condyles 45&deg; ventromedially.</p>
<p>Sereno et al.'s own figure only labels Eoraptor's torsion 35 degrees. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>79. preacetabular process subtriangular.</p>
<p>As noted above &quot;strap-shaped&quot; should be deleted and the taxa coded 
  to reflect their distal shape, not their length. In that case, Heterodontosaurus' 
  is tap-shaped (Santa Luca, 1980), Lesothosaurus' is broken (Thulborn, 1972; 
  Sereno, 1991) and Genasauria's is rounded (Colbert, 1964; Galton, 1974). Panphagia's 
  is also broken (Martinez and Alcober, 2009), while Saturnalia's is tab-shaped 
  (Langer, 2003). Staurikosaurus; is rounbded (Bittencourt and Kellner, 2009). 
  Among theropods, Megapnosaurus; is tab-shaped (Raath, 1990), &quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae's is unpreserved (Tykoski, 1998), Dilophosaurus' is tab-shaped 
  (Tykoski, 2005) and Ceratosaurus' is unpreserved (Gilnmore, 1920). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>81. preacetabular process, attachment scar present.</p>
<p>Also present in Marasuchus (Novas, 1996), Saturnalia (Langer, 2003), Herrerasaurus 
  (Novas, 1993), Staurikosaurus (Bittencourt and Kellner, 2009). Absent in Sauropodiformes 
  (Cooper, 1981; Huene, 1926). Unknown in &quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae (Tykoski, 
  1998) and Ceratosaurus (Gilmore, 1920).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>90. ischial mid shaft cross-sectional shape subtriangular.</p>
<p>This is absent in Panphagia (Martinez and Alcober, 2009). It is also present 
  in Lesothosaurus (Thulborn, 1972), Herrerasaurus (Langer, 2003) and &quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae (Tykoski, 1998). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>122. astragalus fibular facet, primary orientation lateral.</p>
<p>The condition in Lagerpeton (Sereno and Arcucci, 1993) and Lesothosaurus (Thulborn, 
  1972) is unknown. Genasauria (Scutellosaurus- Langer and Benton, 2006) and Herrerasaurus 
  (Langer and Benton, 2006) have a laterally oriented facet. Megapnosaurus (Langer 
  and Benton, 2006) and &quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae (Tykoski, 2005) lack it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>125. astragalus anteromedial corner shape (dorsal view)- anteriorly projecting 
  at least 25% width of the medial side of the astragalus. </p>
<p>Martinez and Alcober (2009) state this is absent in Eoraptor. It's present 
  in Megapnosaurus (Langer and Benton, 2006), &quot;M.&quot; kayentakatae (Tykoski, 
  2005) and Dilophosaurus (Tykosaki, 2005). The condition in Lesothosaurus (Thulborn, 
  1972) is unknown. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Additionally, Sereno et al. found Eoraptor to be closer to Panphagia and Saturnalia 
  than plateosaurians based on- </p>
<p> </p>
<p>83. ventral acetabular flange of ilium present.<br>
  Lesothosaurus lacks a flange (Sereno, 1991).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>88. brevis fossa an arched ventrally-opening ovate or parallel-sided depression.</p>
<p>This was discussed above as being a composite character and miscoded in the 
  outgroup (also in Staurikosaurus- Bittencourt and Kellner, 2009). Regardless, 
  Eodromaeus has the same state as Eoraptor, so the combination is not unexpected 
  in a basal theropod.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>95. ischial antitrochanter, anteroposterior length less than adjacent length 
  of the articular surface for the ilium (also in coelophysoids).</p>
<p>This is actually absent in Panphagia (Martinez and Alcober, 2009), Saturnalia 
  (Langer, 2003), Coelophysis (Padian, 1986), Megapnosaurus (Raath, 1990), &quot;M.&quot; 
  kayentakatae (Tykoski, 2005) and Dilophosaurus (Tykoski, 2005). This is also 
  present in Lagerpeton (Sereno and Arcucci, 1993, coded inapplicable by Sereno 
  et al.), Heterodontosaurus (Santa Luca, 1980), Herrerasaurus (Novas, 1993) and 
  Staurikosaurus (Bittencourt and Kellner, 2009). Silesaurus (Dzik, 2003), Lesothosaurus 
  (Sereno, 1991), Genasauria (Colbert, 1964) and Tawa (Nesbitt et al., 2009) do 
  not seem to have ischial antitrochanters.</p>
