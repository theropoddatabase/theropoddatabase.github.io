<b>Comments</b>- Most recently, Carrano et al. (2012) have published an
extensive revision and phylogenetic analysis for non-coelurosaur
members of this clade.<br>
The addition of <i>Carnotaurus</i> as an external specifier by Sereno
(in press) seems counter-productive. Tetanurae was designed as a stem
away from <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, and abelisaurids were not explicitly
discussed (having been named only a year prior). In fact, technically, <i>Indosaurus</i>
and <i>Indosuchus</i> were classified as tetanurines by Gauthier
(1986), since he lists them as carnosaurs. If abelisaurids are
megalosauroids (as in Paul, 1988), it shouldn't stop megalosauroids
from being tetanurines.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- base of preacetabular process less than half
acetabular height; prominent anteriorly projecting process lateral to
anterior trochanter on femur; medial condyle much larger than lateral
condyle on tibia.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Though Carrano et al. (2012) state the dorsal
centra and ilium are identical to <i>Monolophosaurus</i>, this is
untrue.<br>
<b>Description</b>- Although discovered in 1970 (Kuang, 2004) and
described by He Xinlu back in 1984, <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i> has been
largely ignored in the literature. Little known is that He based the
taxon on two specimens, one much larger than the other. While both
include dorsal and caudal vertebrae, only those of the paratype were
illustrated. Thus whether the paratype belongs to <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>
is unknown, and it is here discussed separately as an elaphrosaur.
Carrano et al. (2012) were the first to note this situation in print
and also thought the paratype was similar to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> and
thus unlikely to be <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>. Comparing the femoral
length to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, the holotype can be estimated to have
measured 2.4 meters in length. Scaling from Paul's (1988) estimated
mass of <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> results in a weight of 12 kilograms. The
unfused sacral centra suggest it is young, which it would have to be if
it is conspecific with the paratype.<br>
The holotype's vertebrae were not illustrated in the paper, but are
visible in a small unpublished photograph. The sacrals are moderately
elongate and gently concave ventrally, and apparently unfused. The
other vertebrae are more fragmentary, but some are more elongate and
presumably distal caudals.<br>
The pelvis is unfused and propubic, with the pubis about 27 degrees
from the vertical. The preacetabular process is broken, but extended
past the pubic peduncle and is dorsoventrally shallow, less than half
of acetabular height. The dorsal edge of the ilium is fairly straight
and there is no vertical ridge or other ornamentation laterally. The
large pubic peduncle projects anteroventrally and is slightly expanded
distally. There is an extensive supracetabular shelf that ends halfway
through the ischial peduncle. The ischial peduncle is craniocaudally
42% as long as the pubic peduncle. The postacetabular process is broken
off, but could not have been very tall.<br>
Only the proximal section of the pubis is preserved. The dorsal margin
of an obturator fenestra can be seen, although with the ventral margin
incomplete, it could be an obturator notch. There is no room for a
pubic fenestra below it.<br>
Only the most proximal section of the ischium is preserved. Oddly, the
ilial peduncle is much wider than the pubic peduncle, contrasting with
the peduncles they attach to. No conclusion regarding obturator
processes or flanges can be reached.<br>
The femur is hollow and sigmoid in medial view. The head is
anteromedially directed and declined ventrally. The anterior trochanter
is a bit more massive than <i>Dilophosaurus</i> in proximal view and
is hooked medially. There seems to be a smaller process directly
lateral to the anterior trochanter. A trochanteric shelf is apparently
absent. The fourth trochanter is smaller than <i>Dilophosaurus</i>,
but much larger than the reduced process in <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>.
Distally, the femur shows a very slight extensor groove and a deep
rounded flexor groove without a cruciate ridge.<br>
The tibia is quite elongate (15% longer than the femur) and slightly
bowed laterally. The proximal end is craniocaudally elongate, has a
single cranial cnemial crest and the lateral condyle is smaller than
the medial condyle. The fibular crest cannot be distinguished.
Distally, the astragalus backed the tibia. In distal view, the tibia is
very anteroposteriorly narrow and roughly triangular.<br>
The tibia, astragalus and calcaneum were unfused to each other. In the
astragalus, the medial condyle is much larger, there seems to be no
transverse groove extending across the condyles and the condyles are
separated from the ascending process by a groove or excavation. The
extent of the ascending process is uncertain, as it is broken
proximally. However, it was obviously more prominent than ornithopods
(contra Norman, 1990) and a bit more extensive than <i>Dilophosaurus</i>,
possibly making the astragalus 83-93% as tall as wide. The anterior
concavity of the astragalus in distal view is not as developed as
coelurosaurs. The calcaneum was large and rectangular.<br>
The metatarsus, though elongate (61% of femoral length), is not
arctometatarsalian. Indeed, the third metatarsal is wider proximally
than distally. I am wary of He's pedal reconstruction however, as
metatarsal IV's distal end seems to be in lateral/medial view, as might
metatarsal III's. Also, metatarsal II's broken distal end appears to be
in posterior view. All this in a reconstruction of anterior view. Maybe
they were twisted due to post-burial deformation or illustrated
inaccurately. The proximal ends of metatarsals II and IV are flared
outward. In proximal view, metatarsal II is more tapered anteriorly,
metatarsal III more narrow, with a less expanded posterior end, and
metatarsal IV is wider and more wedge-shaped than in <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>.
A phalanx, identified as II-1, is shown backwards as its ginglymoid
articulation is facing proximally. This phalanx probably is II-1, as it
is nearly identical in comparative size and shape to that element in <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>.
A series of apparently articulated phalanges are identified as digit
IV. IV-1 is the largest and IV-2 is the shortest. They are all fairly
similar in morphology, with lateral ligament pits and ginglymoid distal
articulations where can be seen. The fact that IV-2 is the shortest
leads to doubt they are articulated correctly, as this is never seen in
theropods. An ungual phalanx is also preserved. It is short and gently
curved, with no obvious flexor tubercle. <br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Not many authors have attempted to classify <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>.
He (1984) assigned it to the Coeluridae (as did Dong, 1992). Such an
assignment is obviously based on small size, as the Coeluridae was the
diminutive equivalent of the Megalosauridae at the time. In actuality, <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>
is much more primitive than <i>Coelurus</i>. Norman (1990) referred it
to Theropoda indet., while noting the primitively broad scapula of the
paratype, low ascending process and uncompressed third metatarsal. The
low ascending process is actually broken, though it would be of
ceratosauroid level if complete (after Welles and Long, 1974). The
third metatarsal is compressed in proximal view, leading to an
hourglass shape seen in averostrans. Holtz (1992) thought the low
ilium, pubic obturator foramen, very low astragalar ascending process
and gracile metatarsus were most similar to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, but
suggested retaining it as Theropoda incertae sedis. In 2001, I
independently suggested it was a ceratosaur related to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>
(based partially on vertebral characters, as I was unaware the hypodigm
belonged to two individuals), but this seems true only for the
paratype. The first author to include the taxon in a published
analysis, Benson (2008, 2010) found <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i> to be a
non-megalosaurian megalosauroid, sister to <i>Monolophosaurus</i>.
More recently, Carrano et al. (2012) and Rauhut et al. (2012) found it
to be a tetanurine outside Orionides+<i>Monolophosaurus</i>, though
when Carrano et al.'s matrix is properly ordered it is in a trichotomy
with <i>Monolophosaurus</i>
and Orionides.  Stiegler (2019) notes "examination of the holotype
specimen (CUT 20010) confirms tetanuran synapomorphies recognized by
those studies as well as a lack of ceratosaurian synapomorphies" and
that "open neurocentral sutures on all preserved vertebrae suggest that
the holotypic <span style="font-style: italic;">Chuandongocoelurus</span>
is represented by juvenile remains."  Furthermore "Some of the
holotypic <span style="font-style: italic;">Chuandongocoelurus</span>
elements were incorporated into a full skeletal reconstruction prior to
examination of the specimens in Chengdu, so some details of its anatomy
were obscured. The remainder of CUT 20010 was nearly completely
prepared and housed at the Chengdu University of Technology
Museum.  Nathan Smith examined all of the materials prior to their
display and provided additional photos of both <span style="font-style: italic;">Chuandongocoelurus</span> (CUT 20010) and
CUT 20011."<br>

approximately half length of  following vertebral centrum;
astragalus with anterior and distal lateral tubercles adjacent the
contact with calcaneum; anteriorly facing part of astragalar body that
is offset from the distal part by a transverse groove anteriorly;
ascending process of astragalus laminar but very low (about one third
the height of the astragalar body); ascending process triangular in
anterior view and inclined laterally; shaft but not proximal end of
metatarsal III strongly constricted between shafts of metatarsals II

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- This was mentioned
early by Rauhut (2006) as "fragmentary remains of a tetanuran",
referring to Rauhut's (2002) SVP abstract.  Yet theropod material
from these beds (then referred to as the upper sequence of the Cañadón
Asfalto Formation) is not mentioned in that abstract.  MPEF PV
1773-19 to 21 were found in 2002, MPEF PV 1773-36 and 37 were found in
2017, and everything else in January 2009.  Rauhut and Pol (2017)
state "despite the disparate times of discovery, all elements were
found in the same erosional gully in an area of six to eight square
meters. Furthermore, the recovered elements are of matching size,
preservational quality, and, in the case of bones known from both left
and right side, of matching morphology (allowing for some deformation),
so that all of this material seems to represent a single
individual."  They "restrict the holotype to the hindlimb elements
in order to avoid confusion in case future discoveries demonstrate that
remains of more than a single individual or taxon are present at this
locality."<br>
Rauhut and Pol added <span style="font-style: italic;">Pandoravenator</span>
to three phylogenetic analyses.  In Carrano et al.'s tetanurine
matrix it emerged as a non-orionidan tetanurine, a basal megalosasuroid
or a basal carnosaur.  In Smith et al.'s theropod matrix it
emerged as a non-orionidan tetanurine closer to birds than <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilesaurus</span> but less than
piatnitzkysaurids, and in Rauhut's theropod analysis it emerged as a
tetanurine sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Piatnityzkysaurus</span>
plus Orionides.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhao and Currie, 1994) anteroposteriorly
elongate premaxilla; long, low external naris; antorbital sinuses in
nasals confluent through openings in base of crest; skull with midline
crest formed by premaxillae, nasals, lacrimals and frontals extending
from above external naris to a point between orbits.<br>
(after Brusatte et al., 2010) nasal process of premaxilla bifurcating
posteriorly; lateral surface of premaxilla with deep groove between
subnarial foramen and foramen on base of nasal process; nasal crest
with straight dorsal margin nearly parallel to alveolar margin of
maxilla; two enlarged, subequal pneumatic fenestrae in posterodorsal
part of narial fossa; lacrimal with discrete, tab-like process
projecting dorsally above preorbital bar; rectangular frontals, much
wider than long (width/length=1.67).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1983 but not mentioned
on paper until Anderson (1987b) notes that the then just-discovered <i>Sinraptor
dongi</i> type "has been tentatively labelled a jiangjunmiaosaurus, a
carnivore first found in the Junggar Basin in 1983 by Zhao Xi Lin." The
name "Jiangjunmaiosaurus" was first used a month earlier in that
journal, referencing the <i>Sinraptor</i> type as an individual of it.
Lambert (1990) is the first author to use the name "Monolophosaurus",
though its entry merely gives the etymology and refers the reader to
the "Jiangjunmiaosaurus" entry. Dong (1992; though the latest included
references are from 1990) mentions "Monolophosaurus jiangjunmiaoi" as a
new allosaurid and provides a photo of the mounted skull and mandible.
The reference given is "Zhao and Currie, in prep./press. A new large
theropod from Jurassic strata of Xinjiang.", which is an early version
of the eventual description. Currie and Zhao (1991) first report the
specimen in the scientific literature, in an SVP abstract that mentions
the cranial anatomy but does not attempt phylogenetic placement. The
name "Monolophosaurus dongi" was used by Grady in his book on the
Chinese-Canadian Dinosaur Project, which was written prior to the final
description by Zhao and Currie (1994) officially naming it <i>Monolophosaurus
jiangi</i>. The etymology indicates Jiangjunmiao translates to "General
Jiang's Temple", so the species name still reflects what the taxon was
originally nicknamed for. Note that while volume 30(10) of the Canadian
Journal of Earth Sciences lists its date as October 1993, it was not
published until February or March of 1994. Brusatte et al. (2010)
recently redescribed the skull, while Zhao et al. (2010) redescribed
the postcrania. Unfortunately, Zhao et al. state the specimen is
"deeply embedded in hard foam for travelling exhibition", so one side
of it cannot be examined.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- Zhao and Currie (1994) placed <i>Monolophosaurus</i>
as a basal tetanurine ("megalosaurid-grade"), but also suggested it may
be a basal allosaurid (closer to <i>Allosaurus</i> than to <i>Sinraptor</i>).
Sereno et al. (1994) placed it within Allosauridae, while most authors
have found it resolves as a basal carnosaur (Holtz, 1996; Holtz, 2000;
Holtz et al., 2004; Novas et al., 2005; Yates, 2005). However, Holtz
(1995) and Smith et al. (2007) recovered <i>Monolophosaurus</i> as the
sister taxon to Avetheropoda. Rauhut's (2000) placement was similar, as
the sister taxon of <i>Afrovenator</i>+Allosauroidea within a
Carnosauria containing megalosauroids. Benson (2008, 2010) found it to
be a basal megalosauroid related to <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>, though
his updated analysis (Benson et al., 2010) placed the latter genus more
ambiguously. Carrano et al. (2012) found <i>Monolophosaurus</i> to be
a non-orionidan tetanurine closer to Orionides than <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>,
though when the matrix is properly ordered it is in a trichotomy with <i>Chuandongocoelurus</i>
and Orionides.  However, only one more step is needed to make it a
non-megalosaurian megalosauroid, so this placement is extremely
tentative. In addition, it takes 4 more steps to place it as a
carnosaur and 5 more steps to place it sister to Avetheropoda, so no
alternative can be firmly rejected.  More recently, Rauhut et al.
(2024) used the Mesozoic Tetrapod Group Theropod Matrix to recover it
as a basal spinosaurid, a result also found using a version of
Carrano's analysis incorporating more spinosaurids (Schade et al.,
2023).<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (MB R 3620; = 67 of Janensch) incomplete tibia (~910
mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Chure (2000) stated this specimen resembles
abelisaurids because it lacks a strongly curved cnemial crest or
incisura tibialis and has no posterior groove between the lateral and
medial condyles, but differs from them in that the astragalus is not
fused to it and the fibular crest is more distally placed. However, the
depth of the incisura tibialis is uncertain since Rauhut (2011)
indicates the low lateral projection distally may be due to erosion.
Furthermore, the posterior groove is present and was merely not
indicated by Janensch's dotted line in the reconstruction. It also
lacks the distally expanded cnemial crest of ceratosaurs (Carrano et
al., 2012). The distally placed fibular crest is a tetanurine
synapomorphy (which is fully compatible with a lack of tarsal fusion),
as noted by Rauhut. Within Tetanurae, the astragalar step excludes <i>tendagurensis</i>
from Coelurosauria, but its more detailed affinities are unknown. The
broad fibular crest is similar to <i>Piatnitzkysaurus</i>, <i>Megalosaurus</i>
and metriacanthosaurines<br>

<b>Late Tithonian, Late Jurassic<br>
Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, Wyoming, US</b> (Reed's
Quarry 12)<br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (YPM VP 058267A-C) partial tibiotarsus<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Dalman, 2014) proximal tibial condyles round;
medial condyle larger than lateral condyle; posterior intercondylar
notch is deep and V-shaped; lateral condyle strongly removed from
medial condyle.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Dalman (2014) also includes characters from the
paratype supposed fibula (fibular shaft with uniform anteroposterior
width throughout most of length; distal fibula anteroposterior width
90% of the width of proximal fibula), though this element is here
excluded from the hypodigm.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Dalman (2014) described the theropod materials from
Reed's Quarry 12, including this tibiotarsus and a supposed fibula (YPM
VP 058267D) he made paratype of this new taxon. The latter element is
unlike a theropod fibula in that its shaft lacks significant distal
taper, and the distal end 84% as wide anteroposteriorly as the proximal
end. As the distal end has a triangular outline similar to tetanurine
tibiae, it may bne that element instead, in which case the proximal end
is crushed and/or incomplete. YPM VP 058267D is from a larger
individual than the holotype and as a fibula is incomparable or as a
tibia lacks shared characters, so should not be referred to the same
taxon.<br>
Dalman presents a confused and contradictory account of <i>Fosterovenator</i>'s
relationships, officially assigning it to Ceratosauridae, then stating
it "clearly belongs to a basal tetanuran", then saying it is "more
closely related to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> than to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>",
and finally saying it and Morrison cf. <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> tibia DMNH
36284 "most likely represent the first occurrence of basal Late
Jurassic abelisauroids in the Northern Hemisphere" based on supposed
similarity to Tendaguru tibiae MB.R.1750 and MB.R.1751. Of course a
ceratosaurid cannot be an abelisauroid or a tetanurine, but no evidence
is presented in support of any of these positions. The tibia seems to
be tetanurine based on the widely separated fibular crest and lateral
condyle, unlike <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Elaphrosaurus</i>, DMNH 36284
or MB.R.1751. The short and distally thick cnemial crest and
posteriorly widely separated proximal condyles are different from named
Morrison genera (<i>Ceratosaurus</i>, <i>Torvosaurus</i>, <i>Saurophaganax</i>,
<i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Tanycolagreus</i>) as well as DMNH 36284 and
NMMNH P-26093, so this may be a valid genus. If Dalman is correct that
the astragalar buttress is rounded and nearly vertical and that the
ascending process is likely taller than in <i>Torvosaurus</i>, <i>Allosaurus</i>
and <i>Coelurus</i>, this may be a coelurosaur. Interpreting
morphology from the low resolution photos with no indication of which
surfaces are true vs. broken is difficult however, and the description
is less than ideal, so determining <i>Fosterovenator</i>'s exact
relationships could be difficult.<br>

comes from at least two individuals, the femur being comparatively
smaller than the other elements. The description has yet to be
translated from Chinese, leaving many details unknown to Western
scientists (such as whether the non-cervical elements are officially
paratypes). Carrano et al. (2012) suggested the cervical morphology
indicated a basal tetanurine or basal averostran. Entering it into
Carrano et al.'s matrix results in a position inside Tetanurae but
excluded from Megalosauria and Avetheropoda. <br>

Material-</b> (IVPP coll?)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1976 (An et al., 2021), this specimen
was first reported by Zhao (1983) who while discussing the evolution of
dinosaurs in China noted "carnosaurs (<i>Megalosaurus</i>)" in the
Middle Jurassic. It might be surmised Zhao was referring to an
undescribed Chinese specimen of <i>Megalosaurus</i>, which is
strengthened by the later mention of a new <i>Megalosaurus</i> species
from the same deposits as other Middle Jurassic taxa Zhao mentions (<i>"Ngexisaurus",
"Lancanjiangosaurus", "Microdontosaurus", "Changtusaurus").</i> As with
other new Tibetan taxa listed by Zhao (1983), it was probably supposed
to be described by Zhao in the published version of his doctoral
dissertation "The Mesozoic vertebrate remains of Xizang (Tibet),
China", in the second Palaeontology of Xizang volume. Yet this volume
is only referenced by Zhao (1983; which was submitted in September
1981) and seems never to have been printed, though the previous volume
was published by the IVPP in 1980 and the third by the NIGP in 1981.
Olshevsky (DML, 1999) notes the IVPP rejected the paper as
unpublishable. Zhao (1985) lists the new species <i>Megalosaurus
dapukaensis</i> as being a carnosaur from the Dabuka Group of Tibet. It
is listed as an undescribed ?megalosaurid <i> </i> from the Dapuka
Group of Xizang Zizhiqu by Weishampel (1990). Zhang and Li (1997) list
this theropod as being from the Middle Dabuka Formation of Dabuka,
Qamdo County, Xizang. Weishampel et al. (2004) list it as <i>?Megalosaurus
cachuensis</i> from the Dapuka Group of Xinjiang, Uygur Zizhiqu and
questionably refer it to Tetanurae (note this is not simply due to it
being referred to <i>Megalosaurus</i>, as other questionable <i>Megalosaurus</i>
species in that section are only referred to Theropoda). The species
"cachuensis" is presumably an error, perhaps caused by
"Lancanjiangosaurus cachuensis" from the same locality. It is listed as
the megalosaurid <i>Megalosaurus tibetensis</i> Zhao gen. et sp. nov.
(MS) in Fang et al. (2006), suggesting that "cachuensis" was indeed an
error, and that Zhao's monograph was never published and is still a
manuscript. Of course Fang et al. are in error in attributing the genus
<i>Megalosaurus</i> to Zhao's manuscript. It may be referrable to <i>Megalosaurus</i>
or Tetanurae, but has not been described or figured so remains a nomen
nudum.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Note contra the Paleobiology Database (online 2006), Deperet and Savornin (1927) made dunkeri a species of their <em>Megalosaurus</em> subgenus <em>Streptospondylus</em>, not a species of the genus <em>Streptospondylus</em>. Osi et al. (2010) described numerous teeth from a
slightly earlier formation, which overlapped <em>M. pannoniensis</em> in
a morphometric study. They referred all of the teeth to basal Tetanurae
(comparing them favorably with <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i>Dubreuillosaurus</i>)
based on the "general shape of the crown, the crown base length/width,
the crown curvature, the morphology of the carinae (especially the
development pattern of the mesial carina)." Carrano et al. (2012) also
considered <i>M. pannoniensis</i> to be a tetanurine based on slight
enamel wrinkles (as in <i>Monolophosaurus</i>, piatnitzkysaurids,
megalosaurines, non-carcharodontosaurine carnosaurs and megaraptorans)
and mesial serrations which are absent basally, though they suggested
the high DSDI (~1.75) could indicate relationship to basal
tyrannosauroids or dromaeosaurids. Its age suggests it is an
avetheropod.<br>
Lapparent (1947) referred fragmentary cranial remains, manual phalanges
and a fibula to <i>Megalosaurus pannoniensis</i>, but these were later
referred to Dromaeosauridae by Allain and Taquet (2000). Three tooth
fragments and three unguals from the Late Campanian-Maastrichtian of
Viso, Portugal were referred to <i>Megalosaurus pannoniensis</i> by
Lapparent and Zbyszewski (1957). They are here listed as Averostra
indet..<br>

who referred it to Megalosauridae based on similarity to <i>Duriavenator</i>,
<i>Gasosaurus</i> and a Chinese specimen of unknown stratigraphic
origin probably incorrectly referred to <i>Megalosaurus bucklandii</i>.
They thought it was distinct from other named theropods in its low
basal width to crown length ratio (.17), but this is also seen in
ceratosaurids, for instance. It remains a nomen nudum because Hawegawa
et al. did not name the tooth, while Hisa's (1985) description was
apparently deficient. While Chure (2000) stated some of the teeth from
the Kabu Formation have enamel wrinkles, Chure et al. (1999) show he
was referring to a tooth from the Jobu Formation (MDM 341). Additional
remains from the Jobu Formation of the Mifune Group (Tamara et al.,
1991- four teeth, tibia, fibula, metatarsals II and III) are sometimes
referred to "Mifunesaurus" as well, but although Chure (2000) stated
the teeth were similar, there are no reported synapomorphies which
would allow placing them in the same taxon.<br>
The tooth crown is 72.7 mm tall, with a FABL of 22.5 mm and a basal
width of 12.3 mm. It is recurved and lens shaped in section, with
almost symmetrically distributed carinae. There are 20 serrations per 5
mm on both mesial and distal carinae. Blood grooves are present at
least posteriorly, but enamel ridges are absent. "Mifunesaurus"' tooth
seems too thick to be a ceratosaurid, and taller than in abelisaurids,
so is probably from a non-maniraptoriform tetanurine, such as a
megalosauroid or carnosaur.<br>

Mocho et al. (2017) have since referred it to ?Turiasauria indet..<br>
The caudal has bnroken prezygapophyses and only the base of
postzygapophyses.  Its centrum is 2.09 times longer than tall
posteriorly and 91% as tall as wide posteriorly.  It is strongly
constricted ventrally and laterally, with a median ventral groove over
the middle 60%, prominent chevron facets and very low transverse
processes.  Articular ends are amphicoelous and trapezoidally
rounded
(wider dorsally).  Only a low ridge is shown for the neural spine,
though it may be broken and the spine of e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>
is only present anteriorly and posteriorly where the dorsal surface of
marchei may be broken away.  Zygapophyseal bases are similar in
height
and angle to those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>'
composite 28th caudal.  <br>
The theropod fauna in Late Jurassic Portugal is very similar to the
well sampled Morrison Formation, allowing a series of comparable
taxa. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ceratosaurus</span> only has very
distal caudals (~c33-39) as elongate which lacks transverse
processes.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>
has caudals with similar centrum dimensions with much larger transverse
processes, extensive neural spine and larger notch below the
postzygapophyses.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;"> Juratyrant</span> lack a transverse
process by that level of elongation.  The most similar caudals are
those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> (28th in
Madsen 1976) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Poekilopleuron</span>
(~38th in Allain and Chure), suggesting <span style="font-style: italic;">marchei</span> is non-coelurosaur

<b>Lectotype</b>- (IVPP V 4024-1) (~7 m) tooth (31 mm)<br>
<b>Paralectotype</b>- ?(IVPP V 4024-3) proximal femur<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- Provisionally indeterminate.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Dong originally based this taxon on a tooth, partial
hindlimb and proximal femur, all from different localities. Sues (1977)
noted since the diagnosis is based on dental characters, the tooth
should be the lectotype. Rauhut and Xu (2005) later made the hindlimb
the holotype of a new species, <i>Xinjiangovenator parvus</i>, which
they found to be a relative of <i>Bagaraatan</i>. Unfortunately, they
neither mention the referred femur nor describe the tooth.<br>
The tooth is about twice the size of <i>Deinonychus</i>, which would
indicate a theropod about seven meters long.<br>
According to Dong's figure, the tooth's outline is near identical to <i>Deinonychus</i>.
It is compressed, recurved and serrated like most theropods. Serrations
extend from the base to the tip of the distal carina, with eighteen
serrations per five mm. The base of the mesial carina is smooth, but
serrations are present starting halfway up. It is said to be thicker
than <i>Deinonychus</i> teeth.<br>
The proximal femur is briefly mentioned, but not described or
illustrated. It was found at a separate site, so should not be regarded
as <i>Phaedrolosaurus</i>. Barsbold and Osmólska (1999) note that this
femur has a wing-like anterior trochanter. This excludes it from
Maniraptora, which have either finger-like or fused anterior
trochanters. The lack of further information makes a more exact
placement within Averostra impossible.<br>
Both Molnar (pers. comm. to Glut 1989; in Glut, 1997) and Sues (1977)
state that <i>Phaedrolosaurus</i> appears dromaeosaurid. Barsbold and Osmólska (1999) say the wing-like lesser trochantor is distinctly
non-dromaeosaurid. Besides these opinions, authors have generally just
placed this genus in the Dromaeosauridae without question. The tooth is
said to be thicker than <i>Deinonychus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>,
but thickness varies with position in the tooth row, and <i>Bambiraptor</i>
and <i>Atrociraptor</i> also have generally thicker teeth than the
former two genera. Carrano et al.'s tetanurine analysis suggests only
tetanurine taxa have apically restricted mesial serrations in the
Cretaceous, but further studies of ceratosaurs may find that the state
is more widely distributed. Among tetanurines, only spinosaurids are
definitely known in the Cretaceous, suggesting <i>Phaedrolosaurus</i>
is most likely an avetheropod.<br>

<b>Material</b>- (IVPP coll.)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1976 (An et al., 2021), this specimen
was first reported by Zhao (1983) who while discussing the evolution of
dinosaurs in China noted "the carnosaurs (<i>Prodeinodon</i> Osborn)
began to specialize" in the Early Cretaceous. It might be surmised Zhao
was referring to an undescribed Tibetan specimen of <i>Prodeinodon</i>,
which is strengthened by the later mention of a new <i>Prodeinodon</i>
species from the same deposits as other Early Cretaceous taxa Zhao
mentions (<i>?Microvenator, Monkonosaurus</i>, <i>?Asiatosaurus</i>).
As with other new Tibetan taxa listed by Zhao (1983), it was probably
supposed to be described by Zhao in the published version of his
doctoral dissertation "The Mesozoic vertebrate remains of Xizang
(Tibet), China", in the second Palaeontology of Xizang volume. Yet this
volume is only referenced by Zhao (1983; which was submitted in
September 1981) and seems never to have been printed, though the
previous volume was published by the IVPP in 1980 and the third by the
NIGP in 1981. Olshevsky (DML, 1999) notes the IVPP rejected the paper
as unpublishable. The species was first named by Zhang and Li (1997) as
<i>Prodeinodon tibetensis</i> from the Laoran Formation of Laoran,
Markam County, Tibet. It is near certainly the same specimen listed as
Tetanurae indet. by Weishampel et al. (2004) from the Lura Formation of
Xizang Zizhiqu. As the specimen has never been described or
illustrated, it is a nomen nudum. Given the age and occurance in China,
it is likely to be a tetanurine and as other <i>Prodeinodon</i>
species are based on teeth this is likely for this species as well.
However, there is still no published evidence for this or its generic
referral.<br>

<b>Comments-</b> Though originally identified as Early Cretaceous
(Lapparent, 1960), the Tiouraren Formation has been reinterpreted as
Bathonian-Oxfordian (Rauhut and Lopez-Arbarello, 2009).<br>
Lapparent referred this species to <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> without
reason, distinguishing it from his <i>Elaphrosaurus</i> <i>iguidiensis</i>
by its larger size and "the form of the vertebrae" and from <i>E.
bambergi</i>
based on the supposedly stouter humerus. Lapparent's syntype series for
the species consists of numerous unassociated remains from In Tedrift
(not mentioned in the list of associated specimens), a proximal
metatarsal from In Abangarit, and an associated individual from In
Tedrift, all catalogued as MNHN 1961-28 (Rauhut and Carrano, 2016).
Sereno et al. (2004) listed only a cervical from the unassociated In
Tedrift remains as the holotype, but this would actually make it a
lectotype since it is a restricted portion of the syntypes. However,
Rauhut and Carrano point out that the ICZN states (Article 74.7.1) "to
be valid, a lectotype designation made after 1999 must ... employ the
term "lectotype" or an exact translation (e.g. "lectotypus", but not
"the type")", which Sereno et al. obviously did not do.  Thus
there is
no valid lectotype, and Rauhut and Carrano note that "the syntype
material includes at least the proximal ends of two right tibiae, ...
and thus clearly represents more than a single animal."  Sereno et
al.
described a new partial axial series MNN TIG6 from the Fako locality of
the Tiouraren Formation as a referred specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">gautieri</span>, which they place in a new
genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Spinostropheus</span>. While
Sereno et al. state the first bones of <i>Spinostropheus</i>
were "disarticulated vertebrae and two partial limb bones" described by
Lapparent, no justification for referring material of Lapparent's to
the taxon were given. Rauhut and Carrano conclude that "MNN TIG6 seems
to be markedly different from the original specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. gautieri</span>",
so that "the referral of this specimen to this taxon is not accepted
here (see below), pending a review of all of this material by Ronan
Allain and Paul Sereno (R. Allain, pers. comm. 2014)."<br>
As for what <span style="font-style: italic;">Spinostropheus gautieri</span>
is without Sereno et al.'s material, Rauhut and Carrano say
"examination of the lectotype [sic] and originally referred material
(Lapparent, 1960) of this taxon by one of us (O.R.) indicates that it
lacks ceratosaurian synapomorphies, and might represent a basal
tetanuran."  This matches their differential diagnosis from <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>-
very slightly opisthocoelous cervical; single pair of anteriorly placed
pleurocentral foramina; shorter cervical centrum with length &lt;2
times posterior height; humerus without bulbous head; humerus with
rounded distal condyles.  It should be noted this is based on two
elements of the unassociated In Tedrift material, so that the ultimate
identity will depend on which element(s) are designated the
lectotype(s).  <br>

referred YPM 4885, 5369, 5378, 5397 and 5408 to Megalosauridae in his
systematic section, but only referred 4885 there in his locality
section, with the others only listed as Theropoda.  Tooth YPM 5377
and supposed dorsal vertebra YPM 5285 were also listed as megalosaurid,
but have since been referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
by D'Emic et al. (2012).  Note Ostrom (p. 69) mistakenly lists the
largest tooth as YPM 5379, which is a small <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
tooth, while the actual number is YPM 5397 (as listed on page 218;
confirmed via the YPM online database).  The teeth are said to
differ from <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> in
having a low DSDI and are probably tetanurine
(carcharodontosaurid, megaraptoran, tyrannosauroid, etc.)
based on stratigraphy.  The dorsal neural arch YPM 5408 is not
described by Ostrom, and that specimen number was accidentally used as
a <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauropelta</span> specimen in the
systematic section, but a photo on the YPM online database shows it
does not resemble a <span style="font-style: italic;">Sauropelta</span>
dorsal (postzygapophyses not connected and at low angle, neural spine
not backswept).  However, it does seem to lack a hyposphene so may
be ornithischian (<span style="font-style: italic;">Tenontosaurus</span>?). 
The distal metatarsal III YPM 4885 was described as "slightly grooved
and not strongly ginglymoid", comparing closely to "<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span>, but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithomimus</span>."  This would
also differ from the <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
holotype, which it is half the size of.  Carrano et al. (2012)
said it "bears features common to many theropods, although it does seem
to differ from most coelurosaurs."  The YPM online database shows
three elements are catalogued under YPM 5538, a proximal <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
fibula from locality 64-75 in Montana, a fibular shaft fragment labeled
"Therapoda indet. (deinonychus?)" without locality information but with
color and specimen number writing matching the other fibula, and the
partial angular listed by Ostrom under Megalosauridae.  The
fragment is from the anterior or middle third, about 1.9 times larger
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span> YPM 5210,
without the mediodorsal lip of that taxon or the dorsoventrally limited
prearticular contact.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span>
has an even more limited prearticular contact and lacks the anterior
expansion of YPM 5538 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>. 
<span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> also lacks anterior
expansion, which is present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Zuolong</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Aorun</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>.  Only the
latter has extensive prearticular contact like YPM 5538, which is also
missing in <span style="font-style: italic;">Murusraptor</span>,
suggesting it could be from a tyrannosauroid.  The latter clade is
known from the Cloverly Formation based on premaxillary tooth FMNH PR
2750.<br>
YPM 5366 was collected in 1964 and was questionably referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span>
by Ostrom (1970), though Makovicky and Sues (1998) stated "this
identification cannot be confirmed<br>
because the holotype does not include any unambiguously associated
teeth."  It is ziphodont and recurved, so unlikely to
belong to that oviraptorosaurian taxon, but is probably tetanurine
(juvenile carcharodontosaurid or megaraptoran, tyrannosauroid, etc.)
based on stratigraphy.<br>
Maxwell (1993) reported "one <span style="font-style: italic;">Microvenator</span>
tooth" from a microsite in Unit VII east of Bridger, Montana, found in
1992.<br>

positional variation. The opisthocoelous centrum is tetanurine, and

have a morphology and size
compatible with the postcranial elements", they "do not preserve
any parts of the root, suggesting that they correspond to shed
teeth." 
They thus excluded the teeth (SHN.03630-32) from the hypodigm and

<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1995) identified these as cf. coelurid and
megalosaurid, while Averianov et al. (2005) stated all variation could
be ontogenetic and positional. They believed the teeth resembled
dromaeosaurids primarily in the basally unserrated mesial carina, but
Carrano et al. (2012) noted this and other characters were consistent
with basal tetanurines too.&nbsp; The metriacanthosaurid Alpkarakush
has been recently described from this formation and is a plausible
identification for some of these teeth.<br>

<b>Material</b>-

proximodistally), humerus (265 mm), ischium (~356 mm), femur, tibia
(~730 mm), fibula (~709 mm) and unguals<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
He (1984) states that in 1964, 1979 and 1980 in Chengdu the institute
(= CUT) "conducted systematic collections in Hexi Commune (near Huomu
Station) in the suburbs of Qingyuan City, including many carnosaur
specimens, including many teeth, cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae,
more than forty caudal vertebrae, complete ischium, femur, tibia and
fibula, as well as relatively complete humerus, coracoid and claws."
(translated)  He referred these to <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus
campi</span>
because the syntypes were also found in the suburbs of Guangyuan and
believed to be from the Shangshaximiao Formation based on faunal
similarities and fossil abundance, "there is no significant difference
in shape and size" between <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>
and the Hexi teeth, and "there is no evidence of the existence of two
or more carnosaurs" from that horizon.  However, the teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span>have
not been shown to be diagnostic within e.g. Metriacanthosauridae,
multiple taxa with megalosaur-grade teeth are now known from the
Shangshaximiao (<span style="font-style: italic;">Leshansaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor hepingensis</span>), and <span style="font-style: italic;">S. campi</span> itself may be from the
Penglaizhen Formation or slightly lower Shuining
Formation instead.  Furthermore, He notes "that the tooth size in
this batch of <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus campi</span>
material we collected is quite varied, which means that in addition to
the differences in individual size, there may also be immature
specimens, because some vertebral centra and neural arches are unfused.
The largest individual is comparable to the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Yanchuanosaurus shangyouensis</span>
[sic], and the smallest individual is estimated to be only 4-5 meters
in length."  Thus multiple individuals and perhaps multiple taxa
are involved, with only the tibia and fibula in Plate X Figures 8-10
being claimed to be from one individual.  Note while Chure (2000)
mentioned a metatarsal as being in this material, He does not indicate
as such and Chure might have mistaken Plate X Figure 6 which is a
humerus.  Indeed, Chure seems not to have translated the text so
understates the preserved vertebral number and misses the reference to
unguals.  Yang et al. (2021) later describe the humeral histology,
noting their <span style="font-style: italic;">Szechuanosaurus</span>

This material was originally referred to Megalosauridae by He (1984)
based on tetanurine plesiomorphies (large teeth, short presacral
vertebrae, distally expanded ischium), while Chure (2000) placed it in
non-avetheropod Tetanurae based on the supposed lack of a posterodistal
coracoid process and subglenoid fossa, although Figure 6-18 of He
clearly shows both.  Although Chure believes the information
available in the literature "make(s) it impossible to refer this
material to any family" and considered it indeterminate, the figures
and plates suggest otherwise.  Among Late Jurassic theropods, the
slightly opisthocoelous cervicals are only known in piatnitzkysaurids
and coelurosaurs, with the long and low neural spines being unlike most
contemporary non-coelurosaur theropods, meaning the mid cervical
vertebra at least is not megalosauroid or carnosaurian. 
Similarly, the large coracoid tubercle is unlike basal tetanurines and
more similar to ceratosaurs or coelurosaurs, although lacking the
hypertrophied size of the former.  As suggested by Chure, the
ischium does resemble <span style="font-style: italic;">Megalosaurus</span>
in the ventral kink of the shaft and boot morphology, although it is
much more robust, thus a referral to <span style="font-style: italic;">Leshansaurus</span>
is plausible.  The tibia on the other hand is more similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinraptor</span>
in the anteroposteriorly short proximal end and anteroposterior
compression distally, so may be metriacanthosaurid.  Based on this
brief comparison, the material deserves restudy and probably represents
multiple tetanurine taxa.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These large teeth were announced as tyrannosaurid in
Barrett and Manabe's (2000) abstract, but Matsuoka et al. (2002) merely
calls them Theropod Type A. The enamel wrinkles are tetanurine and the
high labiolingual compression is like <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, but not
tyrannosaurids. Given their age and location, it would not be
surprising if they were megaraptoran.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Janensch (1920) initially referred the dorsal centra
to <i>Ceratosaurus</i> (followed by Madsen and Welles, 2000), though
he later (1925) was more cautious. Rauhut (2011) found them to be a
tetanurine based on the strong ventral keel, though further assignment
is difficult (besides exclusion from clades with pleurocoelous
posterior dorsals). Rauhut could only identify the hindlimb elements to
non-coelurosaurian Tetanurae, and the distal caudals to Tetanurae. <br>
Janensch (1929) referred a radius HMN M.B.R. 1755 excavated in 1912
from the later Upper
Dinosaur Member to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>,
but Rauhut and Carrano (2016) rejected this
as there is no overlap with the holotype and ceratosaurs would be
expected to have shorter radii.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was described by Ricqles (1967) as

(1995) referred it to Therizinosauria or "groups most closely related
to them" (which in his opinion consisted of spinosaurids and
dryptosaurids). The ungual closely resembles both <i>Baryonyx</i> and <i>Alxasaurus</i>,
though it tapers more than the former and is less curved than the
latter. <br>

<p><b>unnamed Tetanurae</b> (Stromer, 1914)<br>
<b>Cenomanian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Baharija Formation, Egypt</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (IPHG 1911 XII 29; destroyed) proximal femur (Stromer,
1914)<br>
(IPHG 1912 VIII 76; destroyed) tibia (575 mm) (Stromer, 1934)<br>
(IPHG 1912 VIII 192; destroyed) incomplete  tibia (Stromer, 1934)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Stromer (1934) described the tibiae IPHG 1912 VIII 76
and 1912 VIII 192 from the Baharija Formation of Egypt and assigned
them to cf. <i>Elaphrosaurus bambergi</i>. He stated they were
(translated) "most similar to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus
bambergi</span>,
but still differences are evident. As has been expected by the
geological age difference, impossibly the same species can be present,
but a close relative."  The distally placed fibular crest suggest
these are tetanurines, as noted by Rauhut and Carrano (2016), and the
lack of an ascending process buttress further constrains their
relationships. They are roughly similar accounting for distortion, and
share the same small cnemial crest which leads to an unusually broad
proximal outline (76-81% of anteroposterior length), so may be
conspecific. Stromer further referred proximal femur IPHG 1911 XII 29
which he had previously (Stromer, 1914) placed in Ornithopoda, although
this was only loosely defended based on the size similarity to the
Baharija tibiae and that it couldn't be compared well enough to <span style="font-style: italic;">Elaphrosaurus</span>
to discount being closely related.  In fact this femur has a
prominent pointed accessory trochanter showing it is an avetheropod and
not an elaphrosaur.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Poropat et al. (2019)
stated "based on our comparisons of NMV P252700 with the cervical ribs
of several megalosauroid, allosauroid, and tyrannosauroid taxa, we
contend that it is most similar to megaraptorids" but ended up
interpreting it more generally "as a non-maniraptoriform tetanuran
cervical rib."  They said NMV P252704 was similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gualicho</span> (as <span style="font-style: italic;">Aoniraptor</span>)
in that "the transverse processes are restricted to the posterior
two-thirds of the centrum, the postzygapophyses extend only slightly
posterodorsal to the posterior margin of the centrum, the
prezygapophyses are relatively small and project anterodorsally rather
than mostly anteriorly, and a prespinal fossa is present between the
prezygapophyses."  However, "assigning NMV P252704 to
Megaraptoridae on the basis of these superficial similarities is not
possible, because several of these features are more widely distributed
among Theropoda."  Regarding tha manual phalanx, they say "there
are similarities between NMV P252405 and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Australovenator</span>
phalanx originally identified as right manual III-1" but they "regard
NMV P252405 as Tetanurae indet., because it clearly does not pertain to
Ceratosauria."<br>
