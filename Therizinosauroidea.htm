<span style="font-weight: bold;">Segnosauria</span>- <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>While
therizinosaur taxa were known before the 1980s, Barsbold and Perle
(1980) were the first to propose a group greater than family rank for
them, using Segnosauria for <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span> and the still
unnamed <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>.&nbsp;
Their only comment on segnosaurs' relationships within theropods was
"we presume that Segnosauria took to their particular mode of life,
very different from that of other theropods, relatively early" implying
an early divergence.&nbsp; Despite describing braincase characters
shared with ornithomimosaurs and troodontids, Barsbold (1983) later
states "a certain conditionally regarding the segnosaurid condition
[within Theropoda] is maintained (Segnosauria); this is possibly a
group equivalent to it in rank" and ends up merely saying "that
segnosaurids ... should most likely be classified a carnivorous
dinosaurs of indefinite systematic position."&nbsp; It was perhaps
Barsbold's failure to propose any ideas for their relationship within
Theropoda that led workers in the 1980s and early 90s to concentrate on
relationships with herbivorous dinosaurs instead.&nbsp; Paul (1984a,b)
used manual cladistic analysis to propose segnosaurs were sister to
ornithischians, with prosauropods more basal in this
Phytodinosauria.&nbsp; Ironically, Paul was also the first to notice
the tall astragalar ascending process and fibula backed by the tibia
were more similar to Cretaceous theropods than Triassic ones.&nbsp;
Gauthier (1986) and Sereno (1989) both also used cladistic methodology,
proposing segnosaurs were broad-footed sauropodomorphs (equivalent to
modern Plateosauria) or the sister taxon of prosauropods within
Sauropodomorpha respectively.&nbsp; Barsbold and Maryanska (1990) noted
characters shared with theropods (e.g. "lack of a process of the
dentary passing dorsal to the external mandibular fenestra, presence of
pleurocoels in the vertebrae, ... expanded pubic foot") and
sauropodomorphs, but nonsensically stated "many derived characters of
the Segnosauria ... make it impossible to include the segnosaurians
among theropods or sauropodomorphs."&nbsp; Despite this, they found
Gauthier's hypothesis most probable but in need of further
testing.&nbsp; The remains of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>
were discovered in 1988, and this more basal genus would be the
downfall of Segnosauria and the lynchpin for their coelurosaurian
identity.&nbsp; Already in 1991 Olshevsky stated "recent work by D. A.
Russell (pers. comm.), however, suggests instead that they were very
highly derived theropods &#8212; as originally classified &#8212; and that their
resemblance to sauropodomorphs was homoplasious."&nbsp; Russell and
Dong's (1994) seminal publication of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>
confirmed most of Gauthier's proposed saurischian, theropod and
tetanurine characters were present in segnosaurs, with several
exceptions, and their computerized analysis recovered segnosaurs
closest to an oviraptorosaur-troodontid clade, then to
ornithomimosaurs.&nbsp; Clark et al. (1994) redescribed <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>'
skull later that year and noted several characters most similar to
ornithomimosaurs, oviraptorosaurs and troodontids among theropods, as
well as disputing most character evidence from Paul (1984b) and Sereno
(1989).&nbsp; Interestingly, there was not then and has never been a
published computerized phylogenetic analysis of dinosaurs including
segnosaurs and the proposed characters linking them to various
herbivorous dinosaur groups.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Therizinosauroidea to Therizinosauria</span>-
<span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
was originally described as a turtle, but Rozhdestvensky (1970; and
possibly as early as Rozhdestvensky and Khozatsky, 1967) used the
discovery of <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilantaisaurus</span>
to propose the type manual unguals were actually those of a
carnosaurian theropod.&nbsp; Only a couple years after the discovery of
segnosaurs, Perle (1982) described a hindlimb he referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span> and noted
similarities between that genus and <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>,
proposing therizinosaurids and segnosaurids were closely related within
a larger Deinocheirosauria also including <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>.&nbsp;
While the few vague pectoral and forelimb similarities ("very similar"
"morphology in the scapulocoracoid region", "the rather specific
topography of the superglenoid enlargement ... is the same", "The
deltopectoral crest of the humerus was more highly developed ... and,
respectively, the flexors M. coracobrachialis and M. humero-radialis
were stronger") and uncertain referral of the hindlimb to <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
kept the relationship controversial, the hindlimb was recognized as
segnosaurian (e.g. Barsbold and Maryanska, 1990).&nbsp; Russell and
Dong (1994) confirmed the relationship with the description of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>
and its pectoral girdle and forelimb, stating "the morphology of the
hands and feet thus suggests that Therizinosauridae Maleev, 1954 is a
senior synonym for Segnosauridae Perle, 1979."&nbsp; Following this,
"Therizinosauridae Maleev 1954 is available for a superfamily
containing <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span> and the
Therizinosauridae; the group is referred to below as
"therizinosauroids.""&nbsp; This publication tends to use the term
"segnosaur" as unofficial in quotes, perhaps based on ICZN rules
granting a 1954 date to Therizinosauroidea versus Segnosauria's 1980
date, or a wish to distance their tetanurine therizinosauroid concept
from the oddball concept of Segnosauria that existed up till that
point.&nbsp; Note that priority-wise, while Therizinosauroidea has
priority over a potential Segnosauroidea, the ICZN does not regulate
names above family level like Segnosauria.&nbsp; So it would have been
possible to retain a Segnosauria containing both families, or even
containing Therizinosauroidea in the same way Oviraptorosauria contains
Caenagnathoidea.&nbsp; In any case, following 1994 the use of
Segnosauria in the literature plummeted with Therizinosauroidea being
used instead even for more basal examples such as 1999's <span style="font-style: italic;">Beipiaosaurus</span> and 2005's <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span>.&nbsp;
It is ironic then that Russell (1997) proposed Therizinosauria
seemingly as a synonym of Therizinosauroidea (without comment or
justification) when this certainly lacks priority over
Segnosauria.&nbsp; Russell's Therizinosauria was largely ignored over
the next decade, and in 2004 Clark et al. happened to provide a
node-based definition for Therizinosauroidea which limited it to taxa
within the <span style="font-style: italic;">Beipiaosaurus</span> plus
<span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
clade.&nbsp; Zanno's extremely important 2008b thesis on therizinosaurs
(published in 2010) followed Clark et al.'s definition "which serves to
exclude <span style="font-style: italic;">Falcarius</span> from
Therizinosauroidea on the basis of its relatively primitive
morphology."&nbsp; With Therizinosauroidea now a subset of
therizinosaurs, she followed Russell's usage of Therizinosauria for the
stem-group of all therizinosaurs.&nbsp; This has been the consensus
through today, finishing the transition from Segnosauria (1980-1993) to
Therizinosauroidea (1994-2009) to Therizinosauria (2010+) for this
clade.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Segnosaurischia</span>-
Segnosaurischia was a group used by Dong to place segnosaurs on an
equal rank with Saurischia and Ornithischia, with his 1992 phylogram
showing it independently derived from 'thecodonts'.&nbsp; Although
Segnosaurischia is often cited as being named by Dong in his 1992
Chinese dinosaur book, there was a 1987 edition which used it
first.&nbsp; Dong and Yu (1997) were among the last authors to use the
term as by the mid-1990s most experts agreed by then segnosaurs were
theropod saurischians.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Phylogenetic position</span>- Placing
therizinosaurids with deinocheirids as Perle (1982) and Barsbold (1976)
did takes 13 steps in Hartman et al.'s matrix, effectively making <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>
the basalmost therizinosaurian.&nbsp; Making them closer to an
oviraptorosaur plus troodontid clade than dromaeosaurids or
ornithomimosaurs as in Russell and Dong (1994) takes 35 more steps, so
is highly unparsimonious.&nbsp; The pairing of therizinosaurs with
oviraptorosaurs, first in Makovicky's (1995a) thesis then published by
Holtz (1995) and Makovicky (1995b), was almost universal for the next
15 years but takes 13 more steps.&nbsp; Sereno (1998) placed
therizinosaurs sister to ornithomimosaurs, then in 1999 added
alvarezsaurids to the analysis and placed these closer to
ornithomimosaurs.&nbsp; The former takes 6 steps, while placing them
sister to ornithomimosaurs plus alvarezsaurids takes 4 steps.&nbsp;
Zanno (2008a,b, 2010) recovered therizinosaurs sister to
alvarezsauroids plus pennaraptorans, which takes 6 more steps.&nbsp;
Hartman et al. (2019) found therizinosaurs to be sister to
alvarezsaurids in basal Maniraptora.&nbsp; Placing therizinosaurs
sister to Pennaraptora is only 3 steps longer though, and placing them
outside Maniraptoriformes (which has never been recovered in published
analyses) is only 6 steps longer.&nbsp; <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Therizinosauria defined</span>-
Russell (1997) attempted the first definition, which doesn't use any
alvarezsauroid as an external specifier so would fail in Hartman et
al.'s topology where alvarezsauroids and therizinosaurs are sister
taxa.&nbsp; It's also inefficient in using five additional
therizinosaurs as
internal specifiers when only the eponymous taxon is needed.&nbsp;
Zanno
(2010) published a variant of Sereno's (online, 2005) definition,
with the useless change of switching <span style="font-style: italic;">Shuvuuia</span>
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>.&nbsp; It is
used here although the inclusion of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
hasn't been
neccessary for any proposed phylogeny.&nbsp; If anything, I might
suggest using <i>Plateosaurus</i> and <i>Stegosaurus</i> as
additional specifiers instead, just to ensure views like Paul's (1984,
1988a,b) and Sereno's (1989) are covered.<br>
<b>Ex-therizinosaurs</b>- Russell (1984) referred a supposed astragalus
(AMNH 5027) from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, US to
Therizinosauridae indet.. Russell and Manabe (2002) revealed this was
the element properly identified as a <i>Tyrannosaurus </i> quadrate
by Carpenter (1992). <br>
Sues (1978) identified frontal CMN 12349 as <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
and frontal CMN 12355 as Theropoda indet., although note his plates 7
and 8 are switched so that they are given each others' captions. Currie
(1987) accepted CMN 12349 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>,
but with regard to CMN 12355 stated that
"comparison with Mongolian specimens suggests that it may represent <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span> (Currie, in
preparation)."&nbsp; Currie (1992) again stated CMN 12355 "may
represent the segnosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span>"
(although note that as in Sues' paper it is mislabeled 12349 in his
Figure 2) and also referred TMP 1981.016.0231 to Segnosauridae.&nbsp;
Currie
(2005) listed CMN 12349 as a tentative "therizinosauroid similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>", but figured CMN
12355 so probably meant that specimen.&nbsp; Indeed, it seems CMN 12349
was correctly identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
in the first place as it is similar to the holotype and has only been
referred to Therizinosauroidea accidentally due to Sues' original plate
caption mistake.&nbsp; Larson et al. (2014) performed a morphometric
analysis of Dinosaur Park coelurosaur frontals, and found that CMN
12355 grouped with <i>Troodon</i>, so is troodontid instead. Yet
without including a therizinosaur such as <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
itself, the study only had so much explanatory power.&nbsp; More
recently,
Cullen et al. (2020) expanded the analysis to include both <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>
and
the Bissekty therizinosaurid, still recovering CMN 12355 within the
Dinosaur Park troodontid range and far from therizinosaurids.&nbsp;
Both it
and the less complete TMP 1981.016.0231 are here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon formosus</span> sensu lato.<br>
Mateer (1987) described a pedal ungual which Nessov (1995) referred it
to Therizinosauria or "groups most closely related to them" (which in
his opinion consisted of spinosaurids and dryptosaurids). Provisional
comparisons suggest it more closely resembles pedal unguals of <i>Sinraptor</i>
and <i>Poekilopleuron</i> than those of any therizinosaurs (e.g. <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>,
<i>Alxasaurus</i>, <i>Nothronychus</i>, <i>Erlikosaurus</i>), which
tend to be deeper and more curved. CCMGE 456/12457 was figured as a
segnosaur by Nessov but reassigned to Dromaeosauridae by Sues and
Averianov (2014).&nbsp; <br>
A distal phalanx was discovered in 1931 and referred to Theropoda
indet. by Riabinin (1937), but referred to Therizinosauridae based on
the unequally deep collateral ligament pits by Averianov et al. (2003).
Zanno (2008b) noted both sides having well defined pits (albeit better
developed on one side) is unlike therizinosaurs.<br>
Currie (1992) described TMP 1979.015.0001 from the Dinosaur Park
Formation of Alberta, Canada as a possible segnosaurid pedal
ungual.&nbsp; Ryan and Russell (2001) listed cervical vertebra TMP
1986.207.0017 from the Scollard Formation of Alberta, Canada as
Segnosauridae indet. in their faunal list.&nbsp; Cullen et al. (2020)
found both specimens "to be most similar in morphology to
caenagnathids."&nbsp; <br>
Curtice (2000) reports that "In 1997 at the DinoFest 2 symposium
Ratkevich suggested the specimen was a therizinosaur (McCord, personal
communication, 1999)", referring to the sauropod <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonorasaurus</span>.&nbsp; <br>
AMNH 21597 is figured as therizinosaurid ungual on the AMNH online
catalog, but the low curvature and distally placed flexor tubercle are
instead almost identical to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
(e.g. AMNH 6570, 6576).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The genus was spelled "Tiantaisaurus" by Qian et al.

the name are incorrect. The material has been mounted as of 2006
however. The name is a nomen nudum due to being said to be unofficial
(ICZN Article 8.3), not having a listed holotype (Article 16.4), and
not being explicitly cited as gen. et sp. nov. (Article 16.1). Among
the pertinent notes, Qian et al. state at least one cervical is missing

cervicals are pneumatic with amphiplatyan centra, dorsals also have
flat ends, and the pubes and ischia lack distal fusion. <br>

<b>Cenomanian, Late Cretaceous<br>

<b>Material</b>- (Vb-839) incomplete pedal ungual (~50 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Rauhut believes this is a manual ungual and places it
in the Coelurosauria based on its proximodorsal lip, but a lip is
variably present thropughout Avetheropoda. This ungual has several
strange characters, but of described manual unguals resembles <i>Elmisaurus</i>'
the most. It differs from the latter in being shallower, being wider
proximally, having a wider proximodorsal lip, a slightly more
proximally placed flexor tubercle that is less separated from the
ventral articular lip, a groove ventrally distal to the flexor
tubercle, artery grooves that run dorsodistally to join ~1/3 down the
ungual, and a more concave articular surface with no central ridge. The
ventral groove, lack of a central proximal ridge and artery groove
arrangement are unique among described manual unguals. <i>Elmisaurus</i>
is said to have a very indistinctly divided articular surface however,
and even that is only present in the ventral portion. The broad
proximal surface and lack of a central proximal ridge are more similar
to a pedal ungual, but the prominent rounded flexor tubercle,
proximodorsal lip and narrow main body are not. Some dromaeosaurs (<i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
<i>Achillobator</i>, Sudanese taxon) have pedal unguals with such
flexor tubercles (on their second digits), and these have especially
distinct central proximal ridges, slender proximal ends and sharp
ventral edges. These and therizinosaurs have narrow main bodies on
their pedal claws. Among therizinosaurs, it resembles <i>"Chilantaisaurus"
zheziangensis</i> the most, especially in the slight proximodorsal lip
and prominent flexor tubercle. Additionally, the proximal outline is
similar to <i>Nothronychus</i>. I provisionally consider this a
therizinosaur pedal ungual, the priminent proximodorsal lip and
dorsally angled artery grooves indicate a diagnosable taxon.<br>

<b>Material</b>- (CEUM 52399) pedal phalanx IV-2<br>
(CEUM 53282) pedal phalanx III-2<br>
(CEUM coll.) (at least 25 individuals; some adult) hundreds of elements
including lacrimal, jugal, frontal, postorbital, quadrate, dentary,
vertebrae, ilium, pubis, femora (to 400 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Zanno (2010a,b) noted these materials from the Suarez
Quarry differ from the <i>Falcarius</i> type locality in vertebral and
pelvic characters, but pending further preparation and study could
merely be different due to ontogenetic and/or individual variation.
Zanno et al. (2014) later revised this interpretation, finding that
maximum femoral length and length distribution is similar in both
quarries, and that histological analyses show individuals of comparable
age groups are present in both. They proposed the Suarez taxon is more
derived than <i>Falcarius</i> due to- mandibular condyles of quadrate
highly displaced ventrally; "relatively straight and acuminate
symphyseal aspect of the dentary"; reduced dentary tooth recurvature;
ilium with higher preacetabular process; pubic boot larger, &gt;50% of
pubic length. The taxon is also apparently troodontid-like in some
characters, and the authors note that the <i>Geminiraptor</i> type
maxilla is from the same quarry, where no other troodontid material has
been recovered. <br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R181) partial posterior cervical vertebra (~68
mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- After a long history as a generic small theropod,
Naish et al. (2001) and Naish and Martill (2002) identified <i>Thecocoelurus</i>
as an enigmosaur based on the ventrally hourglass-shaped centrum with
ventrolateral ridges joining the parapophyses, and as an oviraptorosaur
based on the round pneumatic foramina and gracile neural spine.
However, Kirkland et al. (2004) later noted strong similarities with
their new basal therizinosaur <i>Falcarius</i>, suggesting placement
in this clade instead. Indeed, Zanno (2010) found <i>Falcarius</i> has
both of the supposed oviraptorosaurian characters, and <i>Jianchangosaurus</i>
does as well. However, Naish (online, 2007) has suggested <i>Thecocoelurus</i>
isn't a therizinosaur after all (citing Naish and Martill, in press).
Naish later (2011) noted <i>Noasaurus</i> has the enigmosaurian
central morphology, and shares the low neural spine and U-shaped
prezygapophyseal gap with these taxa and <i>Thecocoelurus</i> as well
(though note Naish and Martill believed the latter was too broken to
code for gap shape). As Naish found the Early Cretaceous age and
European location more congruent with abelisauroids than caenagnathids,
he tentatively referred <i>Thecocoelurus</i> to
Neoceratosauria/Abelisauroidea. Most recently, Allain et al. (2014)
believed <i>Thecocoelurus</i> was identical in form to their new
supposed Angeac ornithomimosaur. They distinguished both from <i>Noasaurus</i>
based on their concave anterior central surface, but this is true in <i>Masiakasaurus</i>
as well. They also paired <i>Thecocoelurus</i> with the Angeac taxon
based on pneumatic foramina above the prezygapophyses which invade the
neural arch. Yet these are present in cervicals 6-10 of <i>Masiakasaurus</i>,
at least cervical 9 of <i>Heyuannia</i>, and in <i>Conchoraptor</i>
and <i>"Ingenia"</i>. They are also only present on the left side of <i>Thecocoelurus</i>,
placed more posteriorly than in at least <i>Masiakasaurus</i> and the
Angeac taxon, perhaps suggesting breakage of a naturally hollow area or
pneumatic asymmetry. The only preserved posterior cervical of <i>Falcarius</i>
doesn't preserve this area, nor does the illustrated cervical of <i>Chirostenotes</i>.
<br>
<b>Comparisons</b>- Given the diversity of proposed relatives, a
detailed comparison is in order. Contra Naish and Martill, the specimen
resembles posterior cervicals more than anterior ones, and indeed the
supposedly identical Angeac vertebra matches the seventh or eighth of <i>Harpymimus</i>
based on elongation, central articular surface orientation,
prezygapophyseal length and orientation, etc. (contra Allain et al.,
2014). The elongate parapophyses resemble <i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Chirostenotes</i>
and <i>Similicaudipteryx</i> more than <i>Masiakasaurus</i> or the
Angeac taxon. The anterior pleurocoels are placed in an obvious fossa,
like <i>Falcarius</i> and the Angeac taxon, but unlike <i>Masiakasaurus</i>,
<i>Chirostenotes</i> or <i>Similicaudipteryx</i>. The
infradiapophyseal fossa is developed as an elongate groove, as in <i>Falcarius</i>
but unlike <i>Masiakasaurus</i>, the Angeac taxon, <i>Chirostenotes</i>
or <i>Similicaudipteryx</i>. The centrum is taller than wide (midline
height / width minus parapophyses 133%) as in <i>Falcarius</i> (118%),
but unlike the Angeac taxon (95%) and especially <i>Chirostenotes</i>
(74%) and <i>Masiakasaurus</i> (64%). The anterior peduncular fossae
are well defined as in <i>Chirostenotes</i> and at least anterior <i>Falcarius</i>
cervicals, but unlike <i>Masiakasaurus</i> or the Angeac taxon. They
are also placed far below the diagonal prezygapophyseal surface as in
at least anterior <i>Falcarius</i> cervicals, but unlike the Angeac
taxon, <i>Chirostenotes</i> or <i>Masiakasaurus</i>. These two
characters are found in <i>Masiakasaurus</i> anterior cervicals too
though, so the resemblence to <i>Falcarius</i> anterior cervicals may
not be important. The prespinal fossa is broad like <i>Chirostenotes</i>
and <i>Masiakasaurus</i> but unlike the Angeac taxon. It has
anteroposteriorly broad exposure dorsally as in the Angeac taxon and at
least anterior <i>Falcarius</i> cervicals, but not <i>Masiakasaurus</i>
(including anterior cervicals of the latter). <br>
Overall, <i>Thecocoelurus</i> is most similar to <i>Falcarius</i> and
least similar to <i>Masiakasaurus</i>. There are four good characters
shared with <i>Falcarius</i> to the exclusion of the Angeac taxon, and
three characters that are more similar to <i>Chirostenotes</i> than to
the Angeac taxon, but two characters that are more similar to the
Angeac taxon than to <i>Chirostenotes</i>. <i>Falcarius</i> does
differ from <i>Thecocoelurus</i> in having a ventral median ridge on
its centra, but this is an autapomorphy not seen in other
therizinosaurs. Besides this, no characters differ between the specimen
except exact size and shape of pneumatic features, which themselves
vary between right and left sides of <i>Thecocoelurus</i>. Both are
Barremian, and <i>Thecocoelurus</i> is 58% the size of the <i>Falcarius</i>
individual that preserved the posterior cervical (though a growth
series is known, where that individual falls is unreported). Whether <i>Thecocoelurus</i>
and <i>Falcarius</i> share derived characters to the exclusion of
other therizinosaurs would require more study, but at the moment is
seems most parsimonious to consider <i>Thecocoelurus</i> a basal
therizinosaur and not closely related to oviraptorosaurs, the Angeac
taxon or noasaurids.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kirkland et al., 2005) hypertrophied
basisphenoidal recess; extensive, deeply depressed subcondylar and
subotic recesses, each with multiple pneumatic fossae; flexor tubercle
of manual ungual I with deep collateral ligament pits.<br>
(after Zanno, 2010b) antorbital fossa extends onto lateral surface of
nasal; at least five pairs of conical anterior dentary teeth (also in <i>Erlikosaurus</i>);
anteriormost teeth lingually cupped (inapplicable in other
therizinosaurs); median ridge on ventral sulcus of cervical vertebrae;
infraprezygapophyseal fossa on mid dorsal vertebrae divided into three
accessory fossae; accessory caudal centrodiapophyseal lamina on mid
dorsal vertebra; hypertrophied, obliquely oriented humeral
enteipcondyle with concave posterior margin; pubic tubercle well
developed and posterolaterally oriented, placed on anterior edge of
acetabulum.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Of Kirkland et al.'s (2005) original diagnostic
characters, several are now invalid. A ventrally directed basisphenoid
recess is plesiomorphic for theropods. The reported enlarged first
dentary alveolus is either a preservational or preparation artifact, as
there is a small replacement crown preserved in part of it (Zanno,
2006). Zanno states the posterior tuberosity on the distal end of the
humerus opposite the radial condyle is more widely distributed among
coelurosaurs. In addition, she finds the laterally deflected and
biconcave apex of the deltopectoral crest is diagnostic of a more
inclusive clade of therizinosaurs, based on unpublished data. The depth
of manual ungual I's flexor tubercle is not diagnostic, though the
ligament pits are. The lack of a lateral dentary shelf and the elongate
distal caudal vertebrae are plesiomorphic for coelurosaurs, while the
short distal caudal prezygapophyses are present in all therizinosaurs.<br>
Of Zanno's (2010b) diagnostic characters, an inflated basisphenoid is
present in <i>Erlikosaurus</i> and <i>Nothronychus</i>. The
postorbital facet on the frontal which extends anterior to the
postorbital process is primitive, being seen in <i>Incisivosaurus</i>
as well. Anterior teeth which lack serrations are primitive for
maniraptoriforms. The groove extending proximally from the
entepicondyle of the humerus may be plesiomorphic, as it is also
present in <i>Tanycolagreus</i>, <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Khaan</i>.
Zanno also lists "midseries chevrons possessing markedly distinct
cranial tubercles", but this is plesiomorphic, being also seen in <i>Caudipteryx</i>
and <i>Nomingia</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The above material comes from at least ten
individuals, which were excavated starting in 2001. Some of the pedal
phalanges listed under UMNH VP 12331-12353 are pedal unguals. Several
mistakes are present regarding the numbering of elements by Zanno
(2010)- UMNH VP 14526 is listed as UMNH VP 14565 in her text; 14525 is
mistyped 12525 in figure 2; 14539 mislabeled 14529 in figure 13; 12359
is mislabeled 12357 in figure 20A. In addition, UMNH VP 12401 is
mislabeled as 12391 in Kirkland et al. (2005).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Pu et al., 2013) 27 tightly packed maxillary
teeth; dorsal border of the antorbital fenestra formed by maxilla,
nasal, and lacrimal, with the majority of the border formed by the
nasal; no participation of jugal in margin of antorbital fenestra; a
short diastema in anterior tip of dentary; concave labial surface and
convex lingual surface of dentary teeth (except six anterior teeth);
lack of prominent hypapophyses in anterior dorsal vertebrae; proximal
caudal centra with an oval cross section and articular facet as tall as
wide; weakly curved manual unguals with weak flexor tubercles ventral
to articular facet; shallow and elongated ilium; a ridge bounding
cuppedicus fossa confluent with acetabular rim; extensive contact
between pubic apron.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was bought by the Henan Geological Museum
from a private dealer, so lacks an exact stratigraphic position and has
been partially rearranged with mostly sculpted metatarsals. In
addition, the authors misidentified some elements. The supposed right
surangular and angular seem to just be the left surangular, while the
supposed left jugal is the left prearticular. The supposed left
articular is too large, and seems better identified with the supposed
left angular as the right surangular. In the postcranium, the supposed
right metacarpal II is shorter and differently shaped compared to the
left. It would make more sense as a phalanx II-1.<br>

using Zanno's TWiG matrix, a placement confirmed by Hartman et al.

so is extremely unlikely.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Currie and Eberth
(1993) stated "A rough tally of Sino-Soviet field
identifications shows that ... 'theropods' (including large theropods,
small theropods and segnosaurs, but not ornithomimids) were more common
(400 specimens)" and that "The apparent high numbers of carnivorous
dinosaurs can be attributed mostly to ornithomimids [&gt;1000 elements]
and segnosaurids" indicating some significant number of those 400
'theropods' found in June-July 1959 were therizinosaurs.<br>
Dong (1992) reported "In July 1988, the expedition of the CCDP came to
Erenhot (Fig.85) where they collected ... Many limb bones [which] might
be identified as segnosaurs" and listed <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>
sp. as being present in the formation.&nbsp; He later (1993) said "at
least two taxa of segnosaurs" were represented.&nbsp; Currie and Eberth
(1993) stated "isolated elements were commonly recovered by the
Sino-Canadian expeditions in 1988 and 1990. A well-preserved dentary
with teeth is in the collections of the Erenhot Dinosaur Museum. The
isolated elements are indistinguishable from <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus andrewsi</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus ghalbiensis</span>
bones in the collections of the Paleontological Institute (at the
Central State Museum) in Ulaan Baatar. There are a few elements from
the Iren Dabasu that may also be referable to the more poorly known

diversity in the early 90s, they may actually belong to the
contemporaneous <i>Erliansaurus, Neimongosaurus</i>, and/or the
taxon to which the forelimb AMNH 6368 belongs instead.&nbsp; Precise
localities have not been published, but the CCDP excavated several
(Currie and Eberth, 1993: Table 3), all around Iren Nor and far from

<b>Comments</b>-
Watabe and Wishampel (1994) originally noted in an abstract "several
well-preserved segnosaur specimens ... were collected from Baishin
Tsav", but more details were given in the 2000 papers about the
expeditions.&nbsp; Watabe and Suzuki (2000a) listed field number 930820
BTs-II-4 as "Segnosaurid left humerus" and field number 930820 BTs-II-8
(in part) as "segnosaur pubis", both found in August 20 1993.&nbsp;
They
photograph "pelvic part of segnosaurian from Bayshin Tsav (eastern Gobi
region)", showing an articulated sacrum, anterior ilia and partial
pubes, but do not provide a field number.&nbsp; This is presumably the
"well preserved pelvis (M. Watabe pers. comm., December 2006)" cited by
Zanno (2010).&nbsp; The humerus and pubis were prepared the next
year and given the specimen numbers HMNS 95-3-15 and 94-3-11
respectively (Matsumoto et al., 2000).&nbsp; Watabe and Suzuki (2000b)
state
"cranial and postcranial elements of Segnosauria were found" in June
1994, and&nbsp; "A skeleton of Segnosauria was collected from BTs-II,
which
had been discovered in 1993." They listed 940625 BTs II as "Segnosaurid
lower jaw, part of skull, cervical v.".&nbsp; Watabe and Suzuki (2000c)
summed up the finds as "partial bones of the skull, cervical vertebrae
and pubis of a segnosauria."&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>
and cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span> are known
from that locality, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>
is also known from the formation.&nbsp; 930820 BTs-II-4 could be
compared to all three, 930820 BTs-II-8 could be compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span> (though the photo can't
be distinguished from either), and 940625 BTs II could be compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>.<br>
Watabe et al. (2004) report a "large-sized scapula" discovered on July
22 2001 at Amtgai, and excavated on July 25.&nbsp; They stated "The
coracoid was missing in the scapula, however, the relative size of the
coracoid to the scapula is estimated as disproportionally large."&nbsp;
"The morphology of the scapula is close to that of
therizinosaurid."&nbsp; It was photographed as plate 5 figure 1, and
prepared in 2003 (Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig, 2010).<br>
Barsbold et al. (2007) report disarticulated therizinosauroid material
from Shine Us Khuduk found in 2005-2006.<br>
Zanno (2010) stated "A large left femur (estimated length 105 cm) is
labelled IGM 100/84 [the holotype specimen number of <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>], yet is clearly not
associated with the pelvis due to its massive size, which more closely
approximates that of <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>."&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span> is also known from
that locality, so this may be its actual identity.<br>
Kobayashi et al. (2015) reported a therizinosaur from Urlibe Khudak
found in 2012 which has a strongly reduced metacarpal III and no
preserved digit III phalanges. This could be compared to both <i>Segnosaurus</i>
and <i>Enigmosaurus</i>, but notably no other Baynshiren specimens are
complete enough to evaluate manual digit III form. <br>

(~2 m) vertebrae, fragmentary limb elements including humerus and
tibia, skin impressions, feathers (Yao, Zhang and Tang, 2002)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 1999) large skull, about equal to
femoral length; proximodistally elongate lateral articular surface on
the flexor side of manual phalanx I-1.<br>
(after Zanno, 2010) four fused posterior dorsal vertebrae; pygostyle;
lateral buttress of metacarpal I triangular; obturator process of
ischium sinusoidal with ventrally deflected distal portion; ischial
boot twice width of distal shaft; mediodistal ridge on anterior femur.<br>
(proposed) lateral buttress of metacarpal I developed about 40% down
shaft.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Several characters listed by Xu et al. (1999)
in their diagnosis are plesiomorphic for therizinosaurs- short and
bulbous tooth crowns; large tibiofemoral ratio (104%); first metatarsal
does not contact tarsus; proximally compressed metatarsus. The elongate
manus (&gt;110% of femoral length) may be plesiomorphic too, as it is
shared with <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> and avialans, and approached by
microraptorians and <i>Jinfengopteryx</i>. The large skull (about
equal to femoral length) may not be plesiomorphic though (contra
Zanno), as outgroups (oviraptorosaurs, most basal troodontids,
scansoriopterygids, alvarezsauroids, <i>Ornitholestes</i>) have
smaller skulls. The discovery of a complete ilium by Xu et al. (2003)
shows the preacetabular process is not shallow. <br>
Clark et al. (2004) listed the subequal pre- and postacetabular
processes and uncompressed ischial shaft in their diagnosis, but these
are primitive for therizinosaurs.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1996, with the quarry
reexcavated by 2002 and further material discovered (Xu et al., 2003).<br>
The cervicals were about 32 mm, while the posterior dorsals were 44 mm.
The cervical series is estimated to be 304 mm, and the dorsal series
was about 430 mm. This is based on comparison to <i>Neimongosaurus</i>,
compensating for a vertebral count of twelve cervicals and ten dorsals.
The preserved caudal is most similar to the fourth of <i>Neimongosaurus</i>
in central proportions and was about 32 mm, suggesting a tail length of
635 mm. The sacrum may have been about 220 mm, assuming it had five
vertebrae. The skull length is difficult to determine precisely because
how much of the dentary is preserved is neither described, nor
discernable from the photos. The preserved length is said to be 65% of
femoral length, which results in 172 mm. In <i>Erlikosaurus</i>, the
dentary is 68% of mandibular length, so <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>' mandible
was at least 253 mm long. Again, using <i>Erlikosaurus</i> for a
craniomandibular ratio results in a skull at least 265 mm long. The
total length of <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> was therefore about 1.85 meters
long.<br>

<p><b>unnamed possible therizinosaur </b>(Averianov, 2007)<br>
<b>Santonian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Bostobe Formation, Kazakhstan</b><br>
<b>Material</b>- (N 601/12457) (~3.26 m; adult) femur (512 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1995) referred the femur N 601/12457 to <i>Tarbosaurus
</i>sp., but Carr (2005) determined it lacks the synapomorphies of <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
+ <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and of <i>Alectrosaurus</i>. Averianov (2007)
later excluded the femur from Tyrannosauridae (cylindrical anterior
trochanter, extensor groove absent) and noted particular characters
similar to therizinosauroids (low and rounded greater trochanter;
straight lateral margin with little or no lateral expansion of the
lateral condyle; low crescentic fourth trochanter). In particular,
Averianov found it to be virtually identical to <i>Neimongosaurus</i>,
except for being larger and more robust, referring to it as cf. <i>Neimongosaurus</i>
sp.. However, Zanno (2010) noted the femur lacks three characters found
in <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and other derived therizinosaurs- elevated
head; greater trochanter separated from head by cleft; head with
constricted connection to greater trochanter in proximal view. Zanno
did not state whether she believed the femur could be from a less
derived therizinosaur, though <i>Falcarius</i> does lack these
characters, while <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> has the first but not the
second. <i>Alxasaurus</i> seems to have the second two characters at
least. Yet <i>Falcarius</i> and <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> differ from this
femur and <i>Alxasaurus</i> in having wing-like anterior trochanters. <i>Falcarius</i>
also lacks the straight lateral margin and cresentric fourth trochanter
present in this femur and <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>. Thus if it is a
therizinosaur, it seems closest to <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>. Olshevsky
(DML, 1996) incorrectly translated 'femur' as 'ilium', leading to the
records of a Kazakh <i>Tarbosaurus</i> ilium. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Rozhdestvensky (1964) described a manual ungual as a
therizinosaurid, and later (Rozhdestvensky and Khozatsky, 1967)
referred it to cf. <i>Alectrosaurus</i> based on similarity to the
therizinosauroid manual ungual preserved with that tyrannosauroid.
Suslov (1982) described three unguals as dromaeosaurid, but these were
reidentified as therizinosaurian by Nessov (1995). Averianov (2007)
also noted the therizinosauroid identity of these remains and described
additional elements from the same formation. The femora differ from N
601/12457 from the same formation, but are similar to <i>Erliansaurus</i>,
Zhirkindek and Bissekty therizinosaurs and a femur from the Yalovach
Formation. The other material is also indistinguishable from Bissekty
therizinosaurs.<br>

(Russell and Dong, 1994)<br>
?(IVPP V88510) appendicular material (Russell and Dong, 1994)<br>
incomplete skull (Dong, 2003)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Russell and Dong, 1994) about forty dentary
teeth (also in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>); preacetabular process ~170% of
length across peduncles.<br>
(after Zanno, 2010) anteroproximal blade of proximal chevrons with
pronounced lateral flare at region of bifurcation into articular facet.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- A few of the characters listed by Russell and
Dong (1994) in their diagnosis are plesiomorphic- teeth in symphyseal
region of dentary; ligament pits well developed in manual phalanges;
preacetabular process of ilium moderately expanded; pedal unguals II-IV
shorter or subequal to first phalanx in digit. The absence of fusion
between cervical ribs and vertebrae is possibly ontogenetic, as it is
present in the more basal <i>Falcarius</i>. Contra Zanno (2010), the
elongate preacetabular process is not primitive, as it is only
otherwise seen in <i>Epidexipteryx</i> and some birds. Similarly, the
large number of dentary teeth is not necessarily plesiomorphic, as <i>Falcarius</i>,
oviraptorosaurs, and basal members of paravian lineages have less,
though <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> and arctometatarsalians have at least as
many.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Note that while volume 30(10) of the Canadian Journal
of Earth Sciences lists its date as October 1993, it was not published
until February or March of 1994.<br>
This
was discovered in 1988 and first announced in 1989 by Dong et al. who
remarked on "four mediumsized theropods, including one nearly complete
skeleton. An evaluation of the relationships these carnivores will
constitute a very interesting systematic and biogeographic problem",
with a photo of IVPP V88402a in situ as Plate I Figure 2.&nbsp; It was
listed in Olshevsky (1991) as "To be described from China; a primitive
form that according to D. A. Russell (pers. comm.) displays conclusive
evidence that segnosaurians are derived theropods and not
sauropodomorphs."&nbsp; Dong (1992) later stated "A new segnosaur has
been found by the CCDP from Early Cretaceous of the Ordos Basin."&nbsp;
Zanno (2010) notes most of the material of IVPP V88402 could not be
located when she visited the museum. Material which was present is-
five dorsal vertebrae, proximal dorsal ribs, two sacral vertebrae,
fourteen caudal vertebrae, ten chevrons, scapholunare, distal carpal I,
proximal metacarpal I, manual ungual I, proximal metacarpal II, manual
ungual II, and two appendicular fragments. Material of IVPP V88501
which was present includes- three dorsal centra, one and a half sacral
centra, proximal metacarpal I, proximal manual ungual I, proximal
metacarpal II, distal phalanx II-1, proximal phalanx III-3, proximal
manual ungual III, manual phalangeal fragments, distal metatarsals and
partial pedal phalanges.<br>
<i>Alxasaurus elesitaiensis</i> is known from five individuals, but
only three have published measurements. The holotype (IVPP V88402a) is
largest, while IVPP V88501 is about 75% as large, and IVPP V88402b is
said to be about 66% as large. The skull was about 370 mm long, judging
by the dentary. Using <i>Neimongosaurus</i>, but estimating for a more
plesiomorphic vertebral count, generates lengths of 904 mm and 605 mm
for the cervical and dorsal series respectively. The cervicals were
comparatively shorter in <i>Alxasaurus</i>. Finally, the sacrum was
345 mm long, and the tail was 1554 mm long, accounting for the several
missing vertebrae (which also total around 28). This totals to 3.78
meters, remarkably close to Russell and Dong's 3.8 meter estimate based
on a probably inaccurate presacral formula (10 cervicals, 13 dorsals).
IVPP V88501 would then be about 2.83 meters, and IVPP V88402b about
2.49 meters.<br>

temporal occurence. Yet he was comparing a pedal ungual to a manual
ungual, so the diagnosis and taxonomic referral are invalid.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 1972 and initially
described as a megalosaurid referrable to <i>Chilantaisaurus</i> based
on perceived similarities between its pedal ungual I and <i>C.
tashuikouensis</i>'
manual ungual I.&nbsp; Barsbold and Maryanska (1990) considered this a
possible segnosaur based on its short pedal phalanges and enlarged,
strongly curved unguals. Hartman et al. (2019) were the first to
include the species a phylogenetic analysis and found it in a polytomy
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span> and
therizinosaurids.&nbsp; Although Glut (1997) stated this specimen may
have been based on part of the holotype of <i>Nanshiungosaurus
brevispinus</i> (based on a pers. comm from Dong to Molnar in 1984),
they are from different formations and provinces.&nbsp; Only pedal
ungual I and pedal digits II and III are illustrated by Dong, but most
of the pes is illustrated in Qian et al. (2012). <br>
The remains are about 77% as large as the referred <i>Therizinosaurus</i>
pes, giving the taxon an approximate length of 5 meters. <br>

publication of Barsbold (1983), Enigmosauridae fam. nov. is credited to
Barsbold and Perle.&nbsp; They placed the family in Segnosauria,
separated from <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Erlikosaurus</i>. This was
based on several features (narrow pubis and ischium; anterior pubic
symphyseal trough; narrow and elongate obturator process), which at the
time simply distinguished it from <i>Segnosaurus</i> (<i>Erlikosaurus</i>'
pelvis remains unknown). <i>Enigmosaurus</i> could be the pelvis of <i>Erlikosaurus</i>,
but Barsbold and Perle claimed that <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
were too similar otherwise to have such different pelves. This is not
apparent, though with the new discovery of a distal humerus in the type
material, comparison with <i>Erlikosaurus</i> is possible.&nbsp;

<b>Holotype</b>- (IGM 100/84) (~5 m; ~900 kg; old adult) dorsal ribs,
sacrum, distal humerus, radius(?), proximal ulna, ventral ilia (~650
mm), pubes (634 mm), incomplete ischium (524 mm), proximal femur<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Barsbold, 1983) elongate narrow obturator
process (also in <i>Falcarius</i>).<br>
(after Zanno, 2010) ischial obturator processes fused.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Barsbold (1983) also listed narrow pubic and
ischial shafts in his diagnosis, but these are plesiomorphic. The
v-shaped anterior trough formed by the fused pubes would be matched by
other therizinosaur pubes, as their pubic apron is posteriorly placed.
The proximodistally shallow pubic boot is plesiomorphic for theropods,
while the "shoe-like" shape is common in therizinosaurs (e.g. <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i>, <i>Segnosaurus</i>).<br>
Barsbold and Maryanska (1990) listed the uncompressed pubic shaft in
their diagnosis, but this is plesiomorphic for therizinosaurs (e.g. <i>Falcarius</i>,
<i>Beipiaosaurus</i>).<br>
The posterior pubic boot listed by Clark et al. (2004) as diagnostic is
primitive for therizinosaurs.<br>
Of Zanno's (2010) listed diagnostic characters, the subequal anterior
and posterior portions of the pubic boot are primitive, being present
in <i>Falcarius</i> and basal oviraptorosaurs for instance. The fusion
of the pubic symphysis may be due to old age, as Zanno notes large
amounts of resorbed bone. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered prior to December 1978, the holotype was
first illustrated and briefly described by Barsbold
(1979) as "dinosaur from Khara Khutul."&nbsp; He noted it "has not yet
been described and possibly
represents a new family." Barsbold and Perle (1980) later described and
illustrated the specimen as Segnosaurian indet..&nbsp; Within the
publication of Barsbold (1983), both <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>
gen. nov. and <span style="font-style: italic;">E. mongoliensis</span>
gen. et sp. nov. are credited to Barsbold and Perle.&nbsp; Zanno (2010)
noted additional elements were present in the holotype material (dorsal
ribs, distal humerus, possible radius, proximal ulna, proximal femur),
as well as a large therizinosaur femoral shaft which is not referrable
to the type specimen. Zanno is the first author to photograph the type
material, which differs greatly from the drawing in Barsbold and Perle
(1980). In particular, the pubic peduncle is anteroposteriorly
narrower, the ischial peduncle more massive, the postacetabular process
more complete and deeper than reconstructed, the puboischial contact is
deeper, the pubic shaft is thicker and more anteriorly concave, the
pubic boot is deeper, the ischial shaft is thicker, the puboischial
fenestra is much shorter, the obturator process longer, and the distal
ischium broken.<br>
Currie and Eberth (1993) suggested that "There are a few elements from
the Iren Dabasu that may also be referable to the more poorly known
segnosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>"
without evidence, but given their provenence it is more likely these
are <i>Erliansaurus,</i> <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and/or the taxon
represented by AMNH 6368.<br>
Zanno (2010) recovered the taxon as closer to therizinosaurids than <span style="font-style: italic;">Erliansaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Neimongosaurus</span>, but outside a clade
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Suzhousaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothronychus</span>.&nbsp; Hartman et al.
(2019), using all of Zanno's data, found it by <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>, further from
therizinosaurids than <span style="font-style: italic;">Neimongosaurus</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Erliansaurus</span>.&nbsp; Moving
it to Zanno's more derived position takes 4 steps.<br>
<i>Enigmosaurus mongoliensis</i> is mostly known from itsw incomplete
pelvis, which is about 95% the size of <i>Segnosaurus</i>' holotype.
This leads to a tentative length estimate of 5 meters. <br>

element of the rib, form and size of the manual claws, the great
difference in the length is very distinct, which shows a complete basic
appearance of the Mongolian form in a new family of turtle-like
reptiles from Central Asia, Therizinosauridae..."&nbsp; Rozhdestvensky
(1970) first recognized <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
as theropodan, assigning <span style="font-style: italic;">Chilantaisaurus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
(based on the incorrectly assigned forelimb) to Therizinosauiridae and
placing the family in Carnosauria.&nbsp; Barsbold (1976a,b) rejected
the referral of those genera, correcting the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
issue, and believed therizinosaurids were most similar to
deinocheirids, joining them in Deinocheirosauria.&nbsp; However,
Barsbold's classifications were more form-based than phylogenetic as
evidenced by his 1983 statement "therizinosaurids are now classified
within the present infraorder conditionally, only on the basis of
forelimb dimensions. They may form a lineage not closely related to
deinocheirids."&nbsp; As discussed under the Therizinosauria entry,
Perle (1982) connected segnosaurids with deinocheirosaurs, placing them
closer to therizinosaurids in the group, then in 1994 Russell and Dong
formally synonymized the families and made therizinosaurids sister to
their new family Alxasauridae in Therizinosauroidea.<br>
Segnosauridae was established as a monotypic family of theropods by
Perle (1979) until it was synonymized with Therizinosauridae by Russell
and Dong (1994; see Therizinosauria entry).&nbsp; As the eponymous
genus is an internal specifier of the current definition of
Therizinosauridae, this synonymy is objective at the moment.<br>
Dong and Yu (1997) proposed "segnosaurian dinosaurs possibly include
two distinct groups. A group (Segnosauridae) is similar to the
theropods, another (Nanshiungosauridae) is resembles the sauropods"
without noting particular morphological characters or which genera fall
into Nanshiungosauridae besides <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>.&nbsp;
The family has not been used since and the eponymous genus is an
internal specifier of the current definition of Therizinosauridae.<br>
Ryan and Russell (2001) only used Erlikosauridae in a faunal list,
making it a nomen nudum (ICZN Article 13.1.1).&nbsp; Fossilworks.org
credits Eberth et al. (2001) with Erlikosauridae, but any guidebook for
the 2001 SVP meeting wouldn't be out until the meeting's date in
October, whereas Olshevsky (DML, 2001) confirms Mesozoic Vertebrate
Life was out by July.&nbsp; The family has only been used in faunal
lists by authors associated with the RTMP, for frontals and a pedal
ungual from the Dinosaur Park Formation assigned to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus sp.</span>
without merit (see entry above).&nbsp; While it was still used as
recently as Eberth and Evans (2011), no anatomical justification was
ever provided and the eponymous genus is an internal specifier of the
current definition of Therizinosauridae.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Ikegami and
Tomida, 2005) "three branched passages for the exit for the hypoglossal
nerve on the postero-ventral wall of braincase unlike the other
therizinosaurs but as in troodontid and ornithomimosaur, lack of a
depression on the exoccipital unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>,
and presence of a low nuchal crest along the midline of the
supraoccipital unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothronychus</span>."<br>
(after Ikegami et al., 2019) "pubic shaft is flattened mediolaterally
and the pubic boot projects cranially and caudally."<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Ikegami (2002) first reported two teeth found in 1993
and 1995, and in 2003 reported the braincase which was later CT-scanned
(Ikegami and Otani, 2006).&nbsp; Ikegami and Tomida (2005) reported an
additional tooth (from the anterior dentary) and humeral shaft, noting
the latter has a posterior trochanter as in some
therizinosaurids.&nbsp;
Ikegami et al. (2019) noted the discovery of a pubis and femur, finding
the former has "a fused obturator process and cranial and caudal
processes which have been considered autapomorphies of <span style="font-style: italic;">Enigmosaurus</span>."&nbsp; They stated
"additional specimens are required to resolve whether these elements
could belong to a single individual."<br>

several hundred teeth, 192 elements including several sacral centra

fragmentary), several distal metacarpals II, six phalanges II-?, three

several metatarsals I (some fragmentary), several phalanges I-1,

(Sues and Averianov, 2015b)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- A tooth (CCMGE 3/11822) originally identified as a
pachycephalosaur (Nessov, 1981), was later identified as theropod
(Nessov, 1997), and is therizinosauroid (Sues and Averianov, 2015). The
cervical CGMP 1980.14 was described by Britt (1993) and Makovicky
(1995) in their theses. Nessov (1995) was the first author to describe
multiple Bissekty therizinosaur elements (as segnosaurs), though
several elements were misidentified. The phalanges were said to differ
from <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Erlikosaurus</i> in being more
elongate, but this is probably because they are manual instead of pedal
(their ligament pits are reduced). The ungual CCMGE 456/12457 was
figured as a segnosaur by Nessov (1995) but reassigned to
Dromaeosauridae by Sues and Averianov (2014). Nessov (1995) also
tentatively referred a basisphenoid fragment (CCMGE 719/12457) to a
segnosaur, but Sues and Averianov (2015) stated it was "too fragmentary
for more precise taxonomic identification beyond Theropoda." A caudal
(CCMGE 725/12457) referred to cf. <i>Dryptosaurus</i>, Segnosauria or
cf. <i>Hypsibema</i> by Nessov (1995) turns out to be ornithomimid
(Sues and Averianov, 2015a). Nessov (1995) figured a centrum (CCMGE
458/12457) as "a theropod(?) or a large non-flying bird", which was
reidentified as therizinosauroid by Sues and Averianov (2015b). The
braincase CCMGE 628/12457 was originally referred to <i>Turanoceratops</i>
by Nessov (1995), reidentified by Sues and Averianov (2004) as
therizinosauroid, and finally described as titanosaurian by Sues et al.
(2015). A dorsal vertebra was figured as Sauropoda indet. by Nessov
(1997), but is therizinosauroid (Sues and Averianov, 2015b). Sues and
Averianov (2004) first reported proximal and distal scapulae (though no
distal scapulae are noted by Sues and Averianov, 2015b). Sues and
Averianov (2015b) describe the Bissekty therizinosaur material in
detail.<br>
Averianov (2007) first noted multiple taxa are represented, which was
expanded on by Sues and Averianov (2015b). Specifically, two frontal
and humeral morphologies are present. They included the Bissekty
material in a version of Zanno's TWiG analysis and found the chimaeric
OTU to be closer to <i>Therizinosaurus</i> than <i>Alxasaurus</i>,
but outside the clade containing <i>Erliansaurus</i>, <i>Neimongosaurus</i>
and Therizinosauridae.&nbsp; When added to Hartman et al.'s coelurosaur
matrix, the OTU emerges in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Suzhousaurus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span> clade of
therizinosaurids.<br>

? dentary tooth (Button et al., 2015)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Li et al., 2008) transversely expanded distal
ends of sacral and proximal caudal neural spines (possibly in <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>);
preacetabular process of ilium straight and untwisted in dorsal/ventral
view.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Li et al. (2007) listed a pubis with a strongly
concave anterior margin as an apomorphy, but this is also present in <i>Segnosaurus</i>
(Zanno, 2010; contra earlier illustrations) and <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i>. Zanno notes the glenoid is damaged, so the poor
demarcation noted by Li et al. cannot be confirmed. Further, she notes
the "prominent rounded and striated tumescence on the dorsomedial
surface of its scapular portion" is common in derived therizinosaurs.<br>
Li et al. (2008) also listed posterior dorsal spine tables in their
diagnosis, but these are also present in <i>Falcarius</i> (though that
taxon lacks caudal spine tables) and possibly <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>.
Lateral deflection of the preacetabular process is present in all
therizinosauroids, nor does the blade seem particularily thin compared
to <i>Neimongosaurus</i> for instance. But the flatness is diagnostic
compared to the twisted blades in taxa such as <i>Falcarius</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i>.
The preacetabular process has a smoothly rounded anterodorsal edge in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>,
<i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>, <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>, and probably <i>Segnosaurus</i>
(Zanno, 2010; contra earlier illustrations). <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1999 and officially
described by Li et al. (2007) a few months before the SVP abstract
about it and the referred specimen (found in 2004) was published by
Lamanna et al. (2007). The referred specimen was later described by Li
et al. (2008). <i>Suzhousaurus</i> cannot be compared with <i>"Nanshiungosaurus"
bohlini</i> from the same stratigraphic group, and may be synonymous.
If they are indeed synonymous, Li et al. (2007) note the correct name
will be <i>Suzhousaurus bohlini</i>. <br>

<b>Paratype</b>- (LH V0008) sacrum, ilia<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zhang et al., 2001) radius with a prominent
biceps tuberosity; tibia with an extremely long fibular crest that ends
at over 50% the length of the tibia (also in <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>).<br>
(proposed) distal humerus expanded more than three times shaft width.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Most of Zhang et al.'s (2001) listed diagnostic
characters are more widely distributed, as noted by Zanno (2010). In
particular, Zanno stated the distal caudal prezygapophyses were not
more divergent than other therizinosaurs, based on unpublished data
probably referring to <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>. Proximal caudal
vertebrae with a fossa ventral to the transverse process are also known
in <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i> and <i>N? graffami</i>, as well as
oviraptorosaurs such as <i>Nomingia</i>. The lateral surface of the
preacetabular process is twisted dorsally in most therizinosaurs (e.g. <i>Falcarius</i>,
<i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>, <i>Segnosaurus</i>). The fibular crest
of the tibia is not significantly more elongate (57%) than in <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i> (55%), though is longer than <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i>
(50%), <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Erliansaurus</i> (both 48%).
Proximal pedal phalanges with well developed heels are present in <i>Erlikosaurus</i>,
<i>Therizinosaurus</i>, <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i> and <i>N?
graffami</i>. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The type material was discovered in 1999.<i><br>
Neimongosaurus</i> has an almost complete vertebral column preserved,
assuming 22 presacrals like <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>. The fourteen
cervicals are 804 mm long, the eight dorsals are 315 mm and the
estimated 28 caudals are about 755 mm (it appears about six are
missing). Though no sacral measurements are given, both the last dorsal
and the first caudal are about 40 mm. Estimating for <i>Neimongosaurus</i>'
six sacral vertebrae leads to a length of 240 mm. Assuming the skull is
about 95% of humeral length (93% in <i>Erlikosaurus</i>, 98% in <i>Alxasaurus</i>),
that means a 211 mm long skull. These all total to 2.33 meters.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (LH V0002) (~2.57 m; 120 kg; subadult) mid cervical
vertebra (61 mm), posterior cervical vertebra (50 mm), anterior dorsal
vertebra (45 mm), two proximal caudal vertebrae (50, 47 mm), scapula

fragments, ischial fragments, femur (412 mm), tibiae (373 mm), fibula
(~350 mm), partial metatarsals<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 2002) enlarged nutrient foramen on
proximal caudal vertebrae; crest-like posterior trochanter on humerus;
anterior margin of proximal tibia significantly higher than posterior
margin; distally located hypertrophied iliofibularis tubercle on fibula
(also in <i>Nothronychus</i>?).<br>
(proposed) manual phalanges of digit II each shorter than 40% of
metacarpal II length.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Xu et al. note the presence of an oval fossa by
the posterior humeral trochanter, but this is present in other
therizinosaurs as well (e.g. <i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Neimongosaurus</i>-
Zanno, 2008). Zanno (2010) believes the supposed supratrochanteric
process on the ilium is merely the anterior portion of the
postacetabular tuber present in derived therizinosaurs, as the ilium is
crushed and poorly preserved. Xu et al. note <i>Nothronychus</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i>
also have a distally placed m. iliofibularis tubercle on their fibula,
but state <i>Erliansaurus</i>' is larger. Zanno states <i>Nothronychus</i>
also has a hypertrophied tubercle, but the issue cannot be resolved
with current illustrations. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1999.<br>
<i>Erliansaurus bellamanus</i> has wonderful appendicular preservation,
but very few known vertebrae. The mid-cervical vertebra is actually
shorter than <i>Neimongosaurus</i>' (~85%), indicating a much shorter
neck proportionately, as all other dimensions are larger (appendicular
elements 13-24% larger). The cervical series was approximately 680 mm,
assuming a similar number of cervicals. The anterior dorsal centrum is
13% larger than <i>Neimongosaurus</i>', giving a dorsal length
estimate of 355 mm. A sacrum about 20% larger than <i>Neimongosaurus</i>'
would be about 290 mm long. The proximal caudal centrum resembles the
third of <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and is about 1.32 times as long,
suggesting a tail length of 990 mm. Finally, the skull was probably
about 255 mm long, judging by the humeral length. Thus, <i>Erliansaurus</i>
was approximately 2.57 meters.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Maleev, 1955) large size; hypertrophied manual
unguals, longer than four times proximal height; manual unguals highly
compressed transversely (&lt;20% of dorsoventral height).<br>
(after Barsbold, 1976) humerus with hypertrophied deltopectoral crest,
exceeding 60% of humeral length; deep incision into lateral margin of
distal carpal I; manual unguals very slightly curved; manual unguals
with only slight decrease in height distally.<br>
(after Clark et al., 2004) distal carpals partially fused to
metacarpals I and II. <br>
(after Zanno, 2010) enlarged medial longitudinal crest on metacarpal I;
manual ungual I nearly flat ventrally in lateral view.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Maleev's (1955) original diagnosis was based on
comparison to protostegids, so included the absence of dorsal armor,
which is of course plesiomorphic for theropods. However, the body was
probably not broad and depressed, and the "nearly derived forelimbs"
are too ambiguous to evaluate.<br>
Barsbold (1976) listed many additional characters. The short scapular
blade is probably caused by a missing distal end, while the "elongated
ventral expansion" of the scapulocoracoid, whether referring to the
acromion of posteroventral coracoid process, is primitive for
therizinosaurs. The distal humerus is expanded more in <i>Neimongosaurus</i>.
The untwisted humerus and sigmoid radial shaft are found in several
other therizinosaurs. The olecranon fossa of the ulna (described as
semilunate) seems to be shaped similarly to that of <i>Falcarius</i>.
The semilunate distal carpus is plesiomorphic for therizinosaurs. The
first metacarpal is shortest and dorsoventrally flattened, second
longest, and third most slender in all therizinosaurs. The manual
phalanges are comparatively longer than in <i>Erliansaurus</i>. <br>
Of Zanno's (2010) characters, <i>Erliansaurus</i> and <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i> also have metacarpal I over 66% of metacarpal III length
(72% and 75% respectively vs. 76% in <i>Therizinosaurus</i>). Zanno
says <i>Therizinosaurus</i>' manual unguals lack ventrally projecting
flexor tubercles, but that on ungual II is comparable to those of <i>Erliansaurus</i>
in extending to the proximal ungual edge and only having a low ventral
corner. Manual ungual I does have an extremely reduced ventral corner
however, giving the illusion of a non-projected flexor tubercle.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype (PIN 551-483) was discovered in 1948 and
described by Maleev in 1954 as a new taxon of turtle, related to
protostegids. It consists of rib fragments, a metacarpal and three
incomplete manual unguals. Maleev illustrated a rib fragment and
ungual, while Rozhdestvensky (1970) illustrated all three unguals.
Rozhdestvensky reidentified the metacarpal as a metatarsal (he writes
metatarsus, but Maleev described a single element), and referred both
it and the ribs to Sauropoda without justification. The dorsal rib
fragments are described as having T-shaped to triangular sections,
which differs from the round sections in titanosaurs and embryonic
therizinosaurs. Unfortunately, no adult therizinosaur ribs have had
their cross sections described yet, though some theropods are known to
have T-shaped sections (e.g. <i>Tugulusaurus</i>). Notably, the
photographed ribs of <i>Suzhousaurus</i> suggest they have a
longitudinal ridge that could indicate a T-shaped section. However,
Barsbold (1976) states the rib fragments found with IGM 100/15 are more
slender than those found with the holotype. This may indicate the ribs
do not belong to <i>Therizinosaurus</i>, or that different sections or
positions of rib were preserved with each specimen. The metapodial is
described as 270 mm long, which is close in size to metacarpal II in
IGM 100/15, but too short to be any metatarsal except metatarsal I
unless <i>Therizinosaurus</i> had a much shorter pes than <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i>. The reported dorsoventral width of the proximal end (20
mm) is too small to be any metapodial, except perhaps metatarsal I,
which only has a narrow contact with the tarsus. The cylindrical distal
condyle resembles metatarsals more than the ginglymoid metacarpals of
therizinosaurs. This may therefore be a metatarsal I, but the narrow
proximal dimension of metatarsal I in <i>Therizinosaurus</i> is
transverse instead of dorsoventral, and the "short, low crest" present
on the dorsal surface mentioned by Maleev is of unknown homology.
Metacarpals of titanosaurs differ in lacking distal condyles, with both
sauropod metacarpals and metatarsals are too deep proximally to match
Maleev's measurements. There seems to be no reason to suggest it is a
sauropod metatarsal instead of a therizinosaur metatarsal, and
Rozhdestvensky could have been easily confused by the derived
morphology of therizinosaurs (stout metatarsals with wide ends) which
is somewhat sauropod like. <br>
The referred specimen IGM 100/15 was discovered in 1973 and includes
pectoral girdles, forelimbs (missing digits I and III), dorsal ribs and
gastralia (Barsbold, 1976). The forelimb is proportioned very much like
<i>Nothronychus</i>,
and is about 1.8 times larger, leading to a length of 9.6 meters. The
holotype is about 85% as large, so 8.2 meters long. Another proximal
end of a manual ungual (IGM 100/17) was found in 1968 and identified as
belonging to digit III by Barsbold.&nbsp; Another referred manual
ungual (IGM 100/16) was found in 1972 and referred to digit I by
Barsbold.&nbsp; As it lacks the proximal portion, it cannot be measured
accurately. The hindlimb specimen (IGM 100/45) was also discovered in
1973 but is not directly comparable (Perle, 1982), so is referred only
tentatively. It is actually only 94% as large as <i>Segnosaurus</i>
specimen IGM 100/82, so would be about 6.5 meters long. This specimen
was illustrated in figure 18.2K of Barsbold and Maryanska's (1990)
segnosaur chapter as segnosaurid indet.. Zanno (2010) states the IGM
material is all lost but there are photos on Wikipedia of the mounted
specimen so this is untrue for 100/15 at least.<br>

mm; all lost), first through tenth dorsal vertebrae (730 mm; lost),
sacrum (six vertebrae- 680 mm), first caudal vertebra (lost),
incomplete ilium (726 mm), proximal pubis, proximal ischia (474 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Dong, 1979) twelve cervical vertebrae; highly
elongate cervical vertebrae (2.5 times length of dorsal centra) (also
in <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i>); opisthocoelous posterior cervical
centra; ten dorsal vertebrae (unknown in other therizinosaurs more
derived than <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>); sacral spine tables (also in <i>Suzhousaurus</i>);
sacral neural spines with saddle shaped depressions on apex; narrow,
elongate preacetabular process (also in <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>).<br>
(after Clark et al., 2004) proximal puboischial contact much deeper
than acetabulum.<br>
(proposed) ventral edge of preacetabular process cenvex.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- As <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> was originally
identified as a sauropod by Dong (1979), most of the diagnostic
character he listed are now known to be plesiomorphic for
therizinosaurs- short neck compared to sauropods; platycoelous anterior
cervical centra; cervical pleurocoels poorly developed compared to
sauropods; low cervical neural spines; cervical neural spines not
bifid; platycoelous dorsal centra; dorsal centrum height and length
subequal; dorsal pleurocoels shallow compared to sauropods; low and
broad dorsal neural spines; short sacral neural spines; sacral neural
spines fused into lamina; low ilium compared to sauropods; pubis not
twisted; obturator foramen absent in pubis; thick lateral margin of
pubis (as contrasted to the pubic apron); plate-like ischium; fused
ischial symphysis. The presence of ten dorsal vertebrae is less than
the at least twelve present in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>, but is unknown in
other more derived therizinosaurids. Dorsal neural spine tables are
also present in <i>Falcarius</i> and <i>Suzhousaurus</i>. Zanno
(2010) notes there are actually six sacral vertebrae in <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>,
not five as described by Dong. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is
neither straight nor robust. The expanded distal ischium is near
certainly the obturator process and mid dorsal process as found in
other therizinosaurs, with the narrow distal tip broken off.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>
was originally identified by Dong (1979) as a titanosaurine
(titanosaurian in modern usage) sauropod closest to <span style="font-style: italic;">Titanosaurus</span>
itself, but stated "the two are so distinct that it is obvious the
Nanxiong specimen belongs to a new clade."&nbsp; It was still
considered a sauropod by Paul (1984), but by 1988 he had illustrated it
as a segnosaur, both without comment.&nbsp; The first justified
referral to Segnosauria was by Maryanska and Barsbold (1990), who noted
"an opisthopubic pelvis that is very similar to that of <span style="font-style: italic;">S. galbinensis</span>" and that "the
structure of cervical vertebrae in <span style="font-style: italic;">N.
brevispinus</span> is similar to that in the Mongolian
segnosaurians."&nbsp; <br>
Zanno (2010) notes much material is lost, and the pelvis is less
complete than when described by Dong.<br>
The stratigraphic nomenclature has been controversial with Zhao et
al.'s 1991 scheme dividing the Nanxiong into a lower Yuanpu Formation
(which Zanno, 2010 placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>
in) and an upper Pingling Formation (which Russell et al., 1993 placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>
in when they said "Rare skeletal remains in the
Pingling Formation indicate the presence of ... therizinosaurids" and
cite Dong, 1979; note Le Loeuff 2012 didn't realize this and thought
Russell et al.'s therizinosaurid remains were different).&nbsp; The
Guangdong Geological Survey Institute's 2017 stratigraphic nomenclature
replaces the Yuanpu Formation with the Dafeng Formation, which has been
suggested to be Cenomanian-Middle Campanian by Xi et al. 2021 and which
Ke et al. (2023) assigned <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>
to.&nbsp; If Russell et al. were correct in placing <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span>
in the Pingling Formation, that's now known as the Zhenshui Formation
which Xi et al. assign to the Early Maastrichtian.&nbsp; Its
stratigraphic level <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> is shown
in Figure 2 section 10 number 11 of
Mateer and Chen (1992).<br>
One potential problem with size estimates for this species is that both
the line drawings and the plates are said to be at 1/4 size, but the
plates are 1.7 times larger. The line drawing scale is correct, as
shown by two pieces of evidence. First, Russell and Dong (1994)
estimate <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>' mass as 1.5 tons, compared to <i>Segnosaurus</i>'
1.9 tons. The pelvis of <i>Segnosaurus</i> (GM 100/80) and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>
are similar in size assuming the smaller size estimate, with two other <i>Segnosaurus</i>
specimens being slightly larger. Russell and Dong's mass estimates make
sense in this case. If <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> were 1.7 times larger
though, it would also be 1.7 times larger than <i>Segnosaurus</i>'
holotype. It would then be almost 5 times heavier, putting the mass
estimate at over 9 tons. Second, Dong and Yu (1997) diagnosed <i>Nanshiungosaurus?
bohlini</i> as being larger than any known segnosaur. The first dorsal
vertebra in this taxon is 124 mm long. If the smaller size estimate is
correct, <i>Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus</i>' twelfth cervical
(topologically equivalent to <i>N? bohlini</i>'s first dorsal, as the
latter has two less cervicals) is 76 mm long, but if the larger
estimate is correct, it is 129 mm long. This would make <i>N.
brevispinus</i> equivalent to <i>N? bohlini</i> in size, clearly not
what Dong thought was true when describing the latter species. Note
both of the reasons involve Dong, who described <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>
and should therefore know its size.<br>
The pelvis is of similar size to <i>Enigmosaurus</i>, <i>Nothronychus</i>
and <i>Segnosaurus</i> (IGM 100/80). The width and height of the
illustrated twelfth cervical and third dorsal average 85% (76-91%) of
the equivalents in <i>Nothronychus</i>' anterior dorsal (which is one
of the first three in the series). Subtracting for spaces between
centra in the mounted specimen gives a cervical length of 1400 mm, a
dorsal length of 730 mm and a sacral length of 680 mm. Adding 440 mm
for a <i>Segnosaurus</i>-sized skull and 1200 mm for a <i>Neimongosaurus</i>-proportioned
tail gives a total length of 4.45 meters.<br>

several other therizinosaurs (<i>Therizinosaurus</i>, <i>Segnosaurus</i>,
<i>Suzhousaurus</i>, etc.). They use the platycoelous cervicals and
anterior dorsals as a diagnostic character, contrasting them with <i>Nanshiungosaurus
brevispinus</i>' opisthocoelous posterior cervicals and platycoelous
anterior cervicals and dorsals. The cervical centra are also
platycoelous in <i>Nothronychus, Erlikosaurus, Segnosaurus</i>,
posterior cervicals of <i>Falcarius</i>, and anterior cervicals of <i>Nanshiungosaurus
brevispinus</i>, but amphiplatyan in <i>Alxasaurus</i>, and
amphicoelous in <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and posterior cervicals of <i>Falcarius</i>.
Which state is derived is difficult to determine, as <i>Caudipteryx</i>
has amphicoelous centra, <i>Microvenator</i> has platycoelous centra
and the Morrison oviraptoriform has opisthocoelous centra. Low and long
cervical neural spines are found in all therizinosaurs. The cervical
zygapophyses are not longer or wider than in other taxa such as <i>Neimongosaurus</i>
or <i>Falcarius</i>. Dong and Yu state the cervical zygapophyses are
placed well above the neural canals, which is true in <i>Falcarius</i>
as well, especially in posterior cervicals. It is also true in <i>Neimongosaurus</i>'
mid cervicals and <i>Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus</i>' posterior
cervicals, while the dorsally exposed neural canal in <i>Nothronychus</i>
may be due to damage. The anterior dorsal neural spines are said to be
low, which matches <i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus</i>,
<i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i> and <i>N? graffami</i>, though those of <i>Alxasaurus</i>
and <i>Neimongosaurus</i> are tall. They are also diagnosed as being
narrow, which matches <i>Falcarius</i>, though <i>Alxasaurus</i> and
the <i>Nothronychus</i> species have spines which taper to narrow
apices, and <i>Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus</i>' is broad. Finally,
anterior dorsal vertebrae with ventral keels are present in all
therizinosaurs. <br>
The number of cervical vertebrae is lower than <i>Nanshiungosaurus
brevispinus</i> (12) or <i>Neimongosaurus</i> (14), but may be the
same as <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> (11-12) and basal oviraptorosaurs. Fused
cervical ribs are present, like <i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Erlikosaurus</i>,
<i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> <i>brevispinus</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i>,
but unlike <i>Beipiaosaurus, Alxasaurus, Erliansaurus, Nothronychus
mckinleyi</i> and <i>Neimongosaurus</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus
bohlini</span> was discovered in 1992.&nbsp; Dong and Yu (1997) list
different lengths for vertebral centra in the text than they do in the
measurement table. In the text, the axis is 152 mm, the seventh and
eighth cervicals are 192 mm and the ninth and tenth are 143 mm. They
also later state the dorsals are platycoelous, instead of amphiplatyan.
Zanno (2010) indicates the specimen is lost.<br>
This is a difficult specimen to evaluate, as the description is brief,
only the cervicals in dorsal and ventral views were photographed, the
specimen is lost, comparative vertebrae in other therizinosaurs are
often broken or distorted, and most other therizinosaur vertebrae are
from uncertain positions in the presacral column. Consequently, there
are no known diagnostic characters for the species, though a
combination of primitive characters does distinguish it from most
contemporaneous therizinosaurs (<i>Falcarius</i>, <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>,
<i>Alxasaurus</i>). However, it cannot be compared with <i>Suzhousaurus
</i>from the same stratigraphic group besides agreeing in general
anterior dorsal morphology, and may be synonymous. If they are indeed
synonymous, Li et al. (2007) note the correct name will be <i>Suzhousaurus
bohlini</i>. Forcing it to be sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Suzhousaurus</span> in Hartman et al.'s
(2019) matrix takes 2 additional steps.&nbsp; Dong and Yu gave no
reason to refer the species to <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>, it lived much
earlier than that genus, and the number of cervical vertebrae may
indicate it is outside the clade formed by <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> and
<i>Neimongosaurus</i>. Li et al. and Zanno agree the species is not <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>
and put the genus in quotes.&nbsp; Forcing <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus</span> monophyly in
Hartman et al.'s matrix only takes a single step.&nbsp; In their
analysis, <span style="font-style: italic;">bohlini</span> resolves as
a therizinosaurid in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothronychus</span> clade,
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Nanshiungosaurus brevispinus</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Suzhousaurus</span>.<br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- As this was the first recognized "segnosaur",
most of Perle's (1979) original diagnostic characters are now known to
have a wider distribution. Some are primitive for therizinosaurs-
mandible slender; teeth small; anterior dentary teeth recurved;
anterior dentary teeth highly labiolingually compressed; posterior
dentary teeth lanceolate; bipedal; unreduced forelimbs; well developed
deltopectoral crest; manual ungual I highly curved, pointed and
transversely compressed; elongate pubic symphysis. Many are now
diagnostic of more inclusive therizinosaur clades- closely packed
dentary teeth; anterior dentary teeth larger than posterior teeth;
posterior dentary teeth slightly recurved; posterior dentary teeth
slightly labiolingually compressed; short distal caudal vertebrae;
fused scapulocoracoid; ligament pits poorly developed on manual
phalanges; ilia widely separated due to elongate sacral ribs and
transverse processes; laterally flared preacetabular process; short
postacetabular process; lateral tuberosity on postacetabular process;
opisthopubic pelvis; transversely flattened ischium; distally placed
obturator process; obturator process contacts pubis; astragalar
ascending process laterally deflected; calcaneum fits into deep notch
on astragalus; calcaneum has mobile articulation with astragalus;
metatarsal I contacts tarsus; short metatarsus; metatarsals not
compressed proximally. A few are too vague to evaluate- sacral ribs and
transverse processes, scapulocoracoid, pelvis and metatarsus massive.<br>
Barsbold and Perle (1980) diagnosed <i>Segnosaurus</i> by its thick
pedal unguals, but these are plesiomorphic for therizinosaurs.<br>
Barsbold (1983) lists the small symphyseal diastema in the dentary, but
this is plesiomorphic.<br>
Contra Clark et al. (1994), the dentary teeth do not have a high DSDI. <br>
Clark et al. (2004) listed six sacral vertebrae in their diagnosis, but
this is also present in <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i> and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>.<br>
Of Zanno's (2010) diagnostic characters, an overhanging dorsal ilial
margin is present in <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i> (due to crushing?)
and possibly <i>Alxasaurus</i>. A deep distodorsal ischial process is
also present in <i>Suzhousaurus</i> and probably <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>.
She also lists hypertrophied distal epiphyses of the metatarsals, but
there seems to be little difference between <i>Segnosaurus</i> and
other therizinosaurs more derived than <i>Falcarius</i> in this
regard. A subrectangular obturator process is also present in <i>Suzhousaurus</i>
and <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i>. The subcircular puboischial
fenestra is also present in <i>Enigmosaurus</i> and <i>Suzhousaurus</i>.
A proximodistally deep obturator process is also present in <i>Nothronychus
mckinleyi</i> and probably <i>N? graffami</i>. The absence of medial
fusion of the obturator processes is plesiomorphic, while the absence
of a fused pubic symphysis may be ontogenetic. An anteroposteriorly
wide distal pubic shaft is also present in <i>Suzhousaurus</i> and <i>Nothronychus?
graffami</i>. The brevis fossa may not be deeper than that of <i>Neimongosaurus</i>,
which is described as having a "moderately developed" brevis shelf. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The remains of <i>Segnosaurus</i>
were discovered in 1973-1975, and were first noted by Barsbold (1976)
who mentioned "A large, laterally compressed ungual phalanx, similar in
structure and form to that attributed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>,
belongs to another previously unknown dinosaur (under study) found
there [Baynshiren Formation]. This dinosaur does not belong to
Tyrannosauridae."&nbsp; Barsbold (1979) illustrated and briefly
described the pelvis as "segnosaurid", as the official description was
still in press. The holotype of <i>Segnosaurus galbinensis</i> (IGM
100/80; mistyped 100/90 by Barsbold, 1983) includes a mandible, pelvis
and forelimb and vertebral elements. Unfortunately, only the
mandibular, manual and pelvic dimensions are described. Naish (online,
2007) noted a basioccipital is also present, as was shown to him by
Perle, though never mentioned in the literature. Barsbold (1983) also
lists carpal remains for the holotype. Zanno (2010) notes the
vertebral, forelimb and hindlimb material is lost, and the pelvis is
damaged. Zanno also photographs the holotype pelvis, which differs from
earlier illustrations in several respects- the anterodorsal ilial
margin is more rounded, the ischial peduncle of the ilium larger, the
postacetabular process is rectangular and projects ventrally, the pubis
is extremely concave anteriorly and expands gradually toward the boot,
the distodorsal ischial process is larger, the distal ischial end is
longer and narrower, and the obturator process is much larger. The
pelvis is of virtually identical size to <i>Nothronychus</i>,
suggesting this specimen was also close to 5.3 meters. A referred
specimen (IGM 100/83) is a cervical neural arch, pectoral girdle and
forelimb, the latter missing all manual material save an ungual. Zanno
notes that the pectoral girdle and manual ungual are lost. The forelimb
elements are about 20% larger than <i>Nothronychus</i>', so the
specimen may have been about 6.3 meters long. Another possibility is
that this was similar in size to the holotype, but <i>Segnosaurus</i>
has proportionately longer arms than <i>Nothronychus</i>. The holotype
includes comparable elements (humerus, radius, ulna), so the problem is
soluble granted someone examines the remains. The second referred
specimen (IGM 100/82) includes rib fragments, partial pelvis and
virtually complete hindlimb. Zanno notes the ribs, most of the pelvic
material, and some of the hindlimb material including the pes are lost.
He also finds a posterior ilium which is not referrable to this
individual catalogued under the same number. There is confusion
regarding the limb element length in this specimen. Barsbold and Perle
(1980) state the tibia is shorter than the femur, but cite a femoral
length of 840 mm and a tibial length of 860 mm. Barsbold and Maryanska
(1990) stated the tibia was "more than 80%" of femoral length. The
illustration in Barsbold and Perle suggests the tibia is about 830 mm
long. This is very close to the cited measurement, suggesting the
latter is accurate. The femur would then be slightly less than 1075 mm
in length. Comparing the hindlimb elements to other segnosaurs
indicates it was approximately 7.0 meters long. Again, it's possible
this was similar in size to the type, but had proportionately longer
hindlimbs than <i>Nothronychus</i>. And again, examination of the
partial pelvis the two share in common could resolve the problem.
Barsbold (1983) lists IGM 100/87 and 100/88 as referred specimens, but
these are probably typos for 100/82 and 100/83.<br>
Currie and Eberth (1993) suggested isolated elements recovered by the
Sino-Canadian expeditions in 1988 and 1990 from the Iren Dabasu
Formation (Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian) are indistinguishable
from <i>Segnosaurus</i>, but given their provenence it is more likely
these are <i>Erliansaurus,</i> <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and/or the taxon
represented by AMNH 6368.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- AMNH 6368 was found on May 4 1923 at Third Asiatic
Expedition field site 138, 30 meters away from the lectotype of <i>Alectrosaurus
olseni</i> and was thought to belong to the same individual in the
field. Gilmore (1933) prefered to treat them as two individuals. He
placed them in the same species due to the similarity between the
manual unguals, which are &#8220;laterally compressed, strongly curved and
have sharply curved extremities&#8221;, as well as the association in the
field and slenderness. Gilmore originally diagnosed <i>A. olseni</i>
partially on the characteristics of this specimen.&nbsp; Rozhdestvensky
(1970) recognized the similarity to <span style="font-style: italic;">Therizinosaurus</span>
and referred <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span> to
Therizinosauridae, but Barsbold (1976) and Perle (1977) correctly
removed the forelimb from that taxon based on supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
specimen IGM 100/50 with small humerus and manual ungual.&nbsp; Mader
and Bradley (1989) described the specimen in detail as a segnosaurid.
Zanno (2010) notes the slender proportions, poorly defined medial
tuberosity, and posterior humeral trochanter indicates it is not
referable to <i>Neimongosaurus</i>, and it is more gracile than <i>Erliansaurus</i>
and lacks that genus' distinctive crest-shaped posterior trochanter.
Zanno (2006) recovered it as more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span> in her phylogenetic
analysis, and most recently Hartman et al. (2019) found it sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span> in Therizinosauridae.<br>
AMNH 21784 was also discovered on May 4 1923 at Third Asiatic
Expedition
field site 138, but
not catalogued until 1984 and not described until 1989 by Mader and
Bradley. While those authors described them as Theropoda incertae
sedis, they may be therizinosauroid based on their resemblence to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>'
mid caudals (e.g. short centra that become shorter distally; low neural
spines; similarly placed transverse processes) although their neural
spines are more posteriorly restricted and their prezygapophyses are
longer.&nbsp; Although Mader and Bradley considered the caudals too
small to
belong to the same individual as the humerus, they were comparing them
to theropod proximal caudals as they were unaware of therizinosauroids'
modified caudal series with relatively homogenous caudals decreasing in
length distally.&nbsp; In fact, given that <span style="font-style: italic;">Alxasaurus</span>'
holotype humerus is 4% longer than AMNH 6368, its fourteenth-eighteenth
caudals are also slightly longer (39-44 mm) as is an isolated distal
caudal (26 mm), so the sizes are appropriate to belong to a single
therizinosauroid individual.&nbsp; As they are from the same field
site,
that is provisionally accepted here.&nbsp; Mader and Bradley also noted
"two or three unspecified [theropod] elements that regrettably were not
collected due to their "poor condition" (Granger's field record, Third
Asiatic Expedition)" found with the forelimb and caudal material and
might also belong to the same individual.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Barsbold and Perle, 1980) lateral pedal
unguals narrow.<br>
(after Perle, 1981) twenty-three maxillary teeth (unknown in other
therizinosaurs); dentary symphysis more medially recurved than <i>Segnosaurus</i>,
<i>Neimongosaurus</i> or <i>Falcarius</i>; dentary teeth not at all
recurved (also in CAGS-01-IG-1); distal condyles of humerus sharply
separated proximally from shaft (also in <i>Neimongosaurus</i>); .<br>
(after Clark et al., 1994) premaxillary fenestra absent (unknown in
other therizinosaurs); maxillary fenestra absent; maxillary teeth inset
from lateral margin (unknown in other therizinosaurs); vomer extremely
elongate and extending posteriorly to meet cultriform process (also in
an undescribed Chinese therizinosaur- Zanno, 2010); passage for
internal carotid artery enclosed on occiput; external auditory meatus
restricted ventrally by lateral expansion of braincase (unknown in
other therizinosaurs); trigeminal opening divides into three branches
within side wall of braincase (unknown in other therizinosaurs);
lateral dentary shelf begins at fifth tooth position.<br>
(after Zanno et al., 2016) ratio of edentulous anterior dentary length
to tooth row length ~1:8; slight ventral deflection of anterior dentary
(~4 degrees); lateral dentary shelf extensive, reaches posterior
termination of tooth row; lateral dentary shelf sharp, distinctly
raised from lateral surface; tooth row extends to surangular
articulation; posterodorsal dentary process visible in lateral view;
ventral splenial foramen located posterior to dorsal foramen;
posterolateral surangular shelf present; lateral body of surangular
dorsoventrally deep; prearticular bears dorsal tab.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Zanno (2010), the transversely
compressed pedal unguals noted by Barsbold and Perle (1980) are
diagnostic, as they differ from <i>Alxasaurus</i>, <i>"Chilantaisaurus"
zheziangensis</i>, <i>Nothronychus? graffami</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i>.
<i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i> has narrow medial pedal unguals
(originally identified as manual unguals), but thick lateral unguals,
unlike <i>Erlikosaurus</i>. <br>
Perle (1981) included several characters in his diagnosis which
distinguish <i>Erlikosaurus</i> from <i>Segnosaurus</i>, the only
other recognized therizinosaur at the time. The sharp raised alveolar
edge on the dentary symphysis and extensive length of this toothless
area are also present in <i>Neimongosaurus</i>. While Perle lists the
maxillary tooth count as being 24(25?), it is really 23, which is only
diagnostic due to the unknown counts in other therizinosaurs. The 31
dentary teeth are not significantly more numerous than the 28 teeth in <i>Falcarius</i>.
The lack of a coronoid prominence on the surangular is primitive. The
metatarsal II / humeral ratios of <i>Erlikosaurus</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i>
are not significantly different- 36% vs. 38%.<br>
Barsbold (1983) listed small, closely positioned teeth in his
diagnosis, but these are present in all therizinosaurs. The toothless
dentary symphysis is present in other derived therizinosaurids as well
(e.g. <i>Neimongosaurus</i>; <i>Segnosaurus</i>).<br>
Barsbold and Maryanska (1990) listed the less flattened anterior
dentary teeth compared to <i>Segnosaurus</i>, but this is
plesiomorphic. <br>
Relatively few therizinosaurs can be evaluated for the characters
listed by Clark et al. (1994) in their diagnosis, as cranial remains
are rare and the complete skull of <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> is still
undescribed. A toothless premaxilla with sharp ventral edges is also
present in the Nanchao therizinosaur embryo (CAGS-01-IG-1). The
elongate external nares are also present in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> and
the Nanchao embryo. The sharp ventral edge of the antorbital fossa is
also observed in <i>Falcarius</i>. The antorbital fossa is equally
extensive in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>, though not in the Nanchao embryo
(perhaps due to ontogenetic shortening of the snout). Both <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>
and the Nanchao embryo have a maxillary fenestra, unlike <i>Erlikosaurus</i>,
though other therizinosaurs cannot be evaluated. A reduced number of
nutrient foramina are present on the posterior maxilla in both <i>Falcarius</i>
and the Nanchao embryo. The posterodorsal jugal process also extends
dorsally up the laterotemporal fenestra margin in the Nanchao embryo.
The basisphenoid also has extremely large peumatic spaces in the
Nanchao embryo and <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i>. The anterior carotid
foramen does not seem to be exposed on the occiput of <i>Falcarius</i>,
<i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i> or the Nanchao embryo, though it is
unknown in other therizinosaurs. A generally homodont dentition of
linguolabially flattened teeth is primitive for theropods, while
maxillary teeth which are small, lanceolate, unrecurved and constricted
at the base are present in <i>Falcarius</i> and likely all
therizinosaurs, as maxillary and dentary dentition is usually extremely
similar. Likewise, coarsely serrated maxillary teeth are not currently
known for any other therizinosaur (<i>Falcarius</i> has
plesiomorphically small serrations), but are likely present in all
derived therizinosaurs, as their dentary teeth are coarsely serrated.
Clark et al. note that <i>Erlikosaurus</i> has fewer elongate anterior
teeth than <i>Segnosaurus</i>, but this is probably primitive, as <i>Falcarius</i>
is similar in this regard. The other mandibular characters listed in
their diagnosis are specified either as being shared with other
therizinosauroids, or as being shared with either <i>Alxasaurus</i> or
<i>Segnosaurus</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 1972, <i>Erlikosaurus</i> was
confusingly described as gen. et sp. nov. in both Barsbold and Perle
(1980) and Perle (1981), though the former attributes the name to Perle
only. Perle (1981) spelled the genus name <i>Erlicosaurus</i>, which
has been followed by some authors (e.g. Barsbold, 1983; Clark et al.,
1994). However, according to the ICZN (Article 32.5), since there is no
evidence in the original publication that the name is spelled
incorrectly, and the issue is not with suffix or gender, <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
is the correct original spelling. This makes <i>Erlicosaurus</i> an
unjustified emendation (Article 33.2), since there is no evidence in
Perle (1981) that he purposefully changed the spelling, and the
original spelling is not cited. According to Article 33.2.3, "the name
thus emended is available and it has its own author and date and is a
junior objective synonym of the name in its original spelling." An
unjustified emendation can become justified it it has prevailing usage
and is attributed the the original author and date, but <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
has 33,500 Google hits vs. 1,410 for <i>Erlicosaurus</i>, and 254 vs.
106 Google Scholar hits (as of 8-21-2019). Thus the genus should be
spelled <i>Erlikosaurus</i>. Barsbold and Perle (1980) note a left and
right pes, but only a single pes is described by Perle (1981). <br>
Currie and Eberth (1993) suggested isolated elements recovered by the
Sino-Canadian expeditions in 1988 and 1990 from the Iren Dabasu
Formation (Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian) are indistinguishable
from <i>Erlikosaurus</i>, but given their provenence it is more likely
these are <i>Erliansaurus,</i> <i>Neimongosaurus</i> and/or the taxon
represented by AMNH 6368.&nbsp; Frontal CMN 12355 from the Dinosaur
Park Formation has been referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>
(Currie, 1987), but has since been recognized as troodontid (see
discussion under Therizinosauria).<br>
<i>Erlikosaurus andrewsi</i> is known from a skull, fragmentary
cervical vertebrae, humerus and pes. Unfortunately, the vertebral
dimensions are undescribed, so the length can be only loosely
estimated. Based on the humeral, cranial and metatarsal lengths, <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
was somewhere around 3.4 meters long. <br>

<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Zanno et al. (2009), <i>graffami</i>
does not share many unique characters with <i>Nothronychus mckinleyi</i>.
Notably, the obturator process of <i>Nothronychus graffami</i> is not
necessarily more subcircular than that of <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>.
The puboischial fenestra's elongation cannot be measured in <i>N.
mckinleyi</i> due to the missing pubes and seems equally elongate in <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>
in any case. The pubic contact on the obturator process is also limited
to its distal portion in <i>Suzhousaurus</i> and probably <i>Enigmosaurus</i>
and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i>. The deep post-obturator notch on the
ischium is also present in <i>Suzhousaurus</i>. This limits their
shared characters to just the distally tapering scapula, which is only
known to be absent in <i>Segnosaurus</i> and <i>Suzhousaurus</i>
among therizinosaurids. Only the distally tapering scapula is uniquely
shared. As both species share derived characters with other
therizinosaurid genera (<i>Suzhousaurus</i>, <i>Segnosaurus</i>,
etc.), <i>graffami</i> may deserve its own genus.&nbsp; Hartman et al.

....(MSM P4487) incomplete radius or ulna<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kirkland and Wolfe, 2001) serrations on teeth
extend basally to constriction (unknown in <i>N. graffami</i>; also in
<i>Alxasaurus</i>); laterally facing scapular glenoid (also in <i>Segnosaurus</i>).<br>
(after Kirkland et al., 2005) braincase narrow (unknown in <i>N.
graffami</i>).<br>
(after Zanno et al., 2009) heel on posteroventral surface of caudal
centra hypertrophied (approximately one third the dorsoventral length
of the caudal centrum); post-obturator notch narrow (also in <i>Suzhousaurus</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kirkland and Wolfe (2001) included several
characters in their diagnosis, which Zanno et al. (2009) note are
invalid. The coarse serrations and circular root of the tooth are
typical for therizinosaurs. Anterior dorsals with "long pedicle and
large pleurocoel encasing multiple separate pneumatic foramina" are
present in <i>Nanshiungosaurus? bohlini</i>. The slender scapula is
shared with <i>N. graffami</i>, so is listed in the <i>Nothronychus</i>
diagnosis. The humeral characters (straight, slender shaft; short
deltopectoral crest; humeral trochanter absent) are all plesiomorphic.
The manual ungual characters (flexor tubercle not extending below the
proximal articulation; proximodorsal lip absent) are based on
misidentified pedal unguals. The "thin ischium nearly excluded from
acetabulum with large, rectangular, medially situated, obturator
process" is present in other therizinosauroids such as <i>Segnosaurus</i>
and <i>Suzhousaurus</i>. The distally placed m. iliofibularis tubercle
on the fibula is shared with other derived therizinosauroids. While the
lateral pedal unguals are indeed thick, this is plesiomorphic for
therizinosaurs.<br>
Kirkland et al. (2005) listed the almost horizontally oriented
supraoccipital in their diagnosis, but this is shared by <i>Falcarius</i>,
so may be plesiomorphic. They also revised the pedal ungual thickness
character to indicate pedal unguals II-IV are thin and straight, while
I is thicker. The pedal unguals are not straight, however. Furthermore,
pedal unguals I and II are largest in <i>Erlikosaurus</i>, so the
large thin unguals previously identified as manual unguals would be
more likely to be unguals I and II in <i>Nothronychus</i>. This leaves
the smaller, thicker unguals two be from digits III and IV, reversing
Kirkland et al.'s character.<br>
Zanno et al. (2009) also listed platycoelous proximal caudal centra in
their diagnosis, as it does differ from the amphicoelous condition in <i>N.
graffami</i>. Yet <i>Suzhousaurus</i> and <i>Segnosaurus</i> also
share this character. The elongate mid dorsal ischial process which
extends opposite to the obturator process and scapular glenoid lacking
a buttress are plesiomorphic, shared with most derived
therizinosauroids.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The ischium was originally identified as a <i>Zuniceratops</i>
squamosal (as MSM P2106; Wolfe and Kirkland, 1998). Kirkland et al.
(2005) described the braincase, and reidentified the manual unguals as
pedal unguals based on comparisons to the then undescribed <i>N?
graffami</i>, which was confirmed by Zanno et al. (2009). Zanno et al.
also recognized additional elements not noted by Kirkland and Wolfe-
three cervical vertebrae, a dorsal centrum, a chevron fragment, and
pedal phalanx I-1. They also reidentified pedal phalanges IV-3 and IV-4
as III-3 and IV-2, and a supposed ulna as an indeterminate radial or
ulnar shaft. Hedrick et al. (2015) added a distal humerus, and
reidentified metatarsal I as II, and pedal phalanx III-3 as IV-4.
Contra Hedrick et al.'s text, both ulnae are not preserved.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Zanno et al., 2009) scapular glenoid with
pronounced buttress; pubic boot with small posterior process (unknown
in <i>N. mckinleyi</i>); posteroventral margin of pubic boot concave
(unknown in <i>N. mckinleyi</i>); mid dorsal process of ischium
proximodistally short (less than 5% of the total length of ischium);
mid dorsal process of ischium located proximal to obturator foramen.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Zanno et al. also listed amphicoelous proximal
caudal centra in their diagnosis, as it does differ from the
platycoelous condition in <i>N. mckinleyi</i>. Yet <i>Neimongosaurus</i>,
<i>Erliansaurus</i> and <i>Nanshiungosaurus</i> share this character.
The wide post-obturator notch on the ischium is possibly plesiomorphic,
being seen in <i>Segnosaurus</i> and probably <i>Enigmosaurus</i> and
is plausibly derived from the absent notch found in most coelurosaurs.
The caudal centra lack a strong posteroventral heel unlike <i>N.
mckinleyi</i>, but most other therizinosaurs lack this as well. The
straight ulna is probably taphonomic (Hedrick et al., 2015).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was discovered in 2000 and first
identified as therizinosaurid (Gillette et al., 2001), then more
specifically as a species of <i>Nothronychus</i> (Gillette et al.,
2005). Zanno (2008) referred to it as <i>Nothronychus</i> sp. A, but
(accidentally?) labeled it <i>Nothronychus graffami </i>in figure 31
of her unpublished thesis, though this was a nomen nudum at the time
since theses don't count according to the ICZN. Zanno et al. (2009)
later described and officially named the species. As noted above under
the <i>Nothronychus</i> comments, it may not be referrable to that

Hedrick et al. (2015) reidentified the supposed furcula as a
gastralium, though mistyped it as referring to <i>N. mckinleyi</i>'s
description. Contra Hedrick et al.'s text, right metatarsals II and III
are preserved, not II and IV. <br>
