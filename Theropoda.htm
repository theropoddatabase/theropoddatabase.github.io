  <b>Other diagnoses</b>- Marsh's (1881) original diagnosis consisted largely 
  of plesiomorphies- carnivorous; limb bones hollow; digits with prehensile claws; 
  digitigrade pes. The distal pubes are only fused in adult neotheropods. "Vertebrae 
  more or less cavernous" refers to the extremely constricted dorsal centra 
  of <i>Allosaurus</i>, which aren't present in most theropods. "Post-pubis 
  present" probably refers to <i>Allosaurus</i>' elongate pubic boot, which 
  is only present in some avetheropods.<br>
  Marsh (1884) added more plesiomorphies- premaxilla toothed; external nares placed 
  anteriorly; large antorbital fossa; forelimbs short; propubic pelvis.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1881) named Theropoda as a dinosaur suborder containing 
  only the Allosauridae, in which he placed <i>Allosaurus</i>, <i>Creosaurus</i> 
  and <i>Labrosaurus</i> (both of the latter now recognized as synonyms of <i>Allosaurus</i>). 
  By 1884, Marsh had raised Theropoda to an order and expanded it to include all 
  carnivorous dinosaurs, as well as what are today recognized as basal sauropodomorphs 
  (often mixed with cranial elements of canivorous crurotarsans). This was the 
  standard for many decades, as seen in Romer's (1956) classic work, in which 
  theropods consist of coelurosaurs, carnosaurs and prosauropods. The monophyly 
  of theropods was questioned by Huene (1914), who placed most of the larger taxa 
  such as <i>Allosaurus</i> and <i>Megalosaurus</i> in Sauropodomorpha (his Pachypodosauria) 
  while the smaller taxa (which he named Coelurosauria) had branched off earlier. 
  In the 1960's, workers began to recognize the monophyly of coelurosaurs and 
  carnosaurs to the exclusion of basal sauropodomorphs (e.g. Colbert, 1964). Paul 
  (1984) was the first author to use a theropod phylogeny similar to todays, with 
  deinonychosaurs (albeit paraphyletic), tyrannosaurids, allosaurids, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i>, 
  <i>Ceratosaurus</i> and coelophysoids forming successively more distant sister 
  taxa to birds. Gauthier's (1984) thesis also had a modern topology, with deinonychosaurs, 
  ornithomimids, carnosaurs and ceratosaurs (the latter two improbably inclusive, 
  containing tyrannosaurids and coelophysoids respectively) successively further 
  from birds, and is the basis of our current nomenclature for major clades. <br>
  <b>Goniopoda, Harpagosauria, Therophagi and Carnosauriformes</b>- Cope (1866) 
  named Goniopoda for <i>Dryptosaurus</i> (his <i>Laelaps</i>) and <i>Streptospondylus</i> 
  (his <i>Megalosaurus</i>) based on his misinterpretation of their astragalus 
  as a fibula, as a fibula which wraps distally around the tibia would be unique. 
  The taxon was almost exclusively used by Cope through the 1880's for carnivorous 
  dinosaurs even after the astragalus was correctly identified. He eventually 
  gave it a scope and diagnosis similar to Marsh's Theropoda (e.g. Cope, 1883). 
  After Cope's death, Theropoda became the term almost exclusively used for carnivorous 
  dinosaurs.<br>
  Harpagosauria was seen as a paraphyletic order of dinosaurs by Haeckel (1866), 
  containing <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Plateosaurus</i> and <i>Pelorosaurus</i> 
  (but not <i>Iguanodon</i>). Haeckel refers to these as the carnivorous dinosaurs, 
  which led Cope to synonymize the taxon with his Goniopoda (starting in 1870, 
  and consistantly misspelled Harpagmosauria). However, Haeckel's original usage 
  suggests it is instead the equivalent to Saurischia. Baur (1887) uses Harpagosauria 
  as a dinosaurian group containing only Goniopoda, with Sauropoda separate. Haeckel 
  (1895) later used Harpagosauria as a junior synonym for his new dinosaurian 
  taxon Dysdracones including both Arctopoda (containing basal sauropodomorphs) 
  and Theropoda, with sauropods now placed in his Eudracones that contained all 
  herbivorous dinosaurs. Harpagosauria was said to contain the carnivorous dinosaurs 
  with sharp teeth and claws. It has not been used since.<br>
  Therophagi was named by Jaekel (1914) for a saurischian group containing the 
  taxa then usually referred to Theropoda- anchisaurids, zanclodontids (mixing 
  sauropodomorph postcrania with crurotarsan crania), ceratosaurids, megalosaurids 
  and tyrannosaurids. Plateosauridae and Sauropoda were placed in the Allophagi 
  however. The names have not been used since.<br>
  Proposed as part of a cladistic reclassification of ornithischians, Carnosauriformes 
  was named by Cooper (1985) as a cohort of dinosaurs "retaining the primitive 
  condition of recurved thecodontian dentition with finely serrated cutting edges." 
  No justification for using this name over Theropoda was given, and it is today 
  rightfully considered a junior synonym.<br>
  <b>Theropoda defined</b>- Gauthier (1986) was the first to phylogenetically 
  define Theropoda, as "birds and all saurischians that are closer to birds 
  than they are to sauropodomorphs." Variations on this definition have been 
  most common, with Sereno (1998) using Neornithes and <i>Saltasaurus</i>, specified 
  by Sereno (2004) as <i>Passer domesticus</i> and <i>Saltasaurus loricatus</i>. 
  Holtz and Osmolska (2004) chose <i>Cetiosaurus oxoniensis</i> as the sauropodomorph 
  specifier instead. However, this class of definition violates Phylocode Recommendation 
  11A- "Definitions of converted clade names should be stated in a way that 
  attempts to capture the spirit of traditional use to the degree that it is consistent 
  with the contemporary concept of monophyly." While birds are currently 
  thought to be theropods, this was not the consensus until over a century after 
  Theropoda was named. Similarly, Clarke et al.'s (2004) definition using <i>Plateosaurus 
  engelhardti</i> as an external specifier is problematic since basal sauropodomorphs 
  were often included in Theropoda until the 1960s. Kischlat (2000) suggested 
  all taxa closer to <i>Allosaurus</i> than to <i>Morosaurus</i>, which is valid 
  in using taxa Marsh (1881) and everyone since have recognized as being theropod 
  and non-theropod.&nbsp; The official definition by Naish et al. (2020) retained <span style="font-style: italic;">Allosaurus</span> but also used <span style="font-style: italic;">Plateosaurus</span> and the basal ornithischian <span style="font-style: italic;">Heterodontosaurus</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
  <b>Ex-theropods</b>- Numerous taxa (at least 130) have been incorrectly placed 
  in Theropoda in the past, including ornithosuchids, poposaurids, most basal 
  avemetatarsalians and basal sauropodomorphs, and many Triassic archosauriforms 
  known only from teeth. This site has <a href="Nontheropods%20cladogram%20test.html#extheropods">an 
  entire section devoted to ex-theropods</a>, so they are not discussed further 
  here.<br>

  <b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Novas et al., 2015; note only convergences with closely 
  related taxa or alvarezsaurids are mentioned here) dentary deeper anteriorly 
  than posteriorly; teeth basally constricted (also in maniraptoriforms); teeth 
  serrated only apically; tooth crowns with large apical wear facets; posterior 
  cervical pleurocoels (also in basal neotheropods); cervicals with septate pleurocoels; 
  coracoid with transversely thick margins; manual phalanx II-2 shorter than II-1 
  (also in coelophysoids and some alvarezsaurids); manual digit III atrophied 
  (also in some alvarezsaurids); supratrochanteric process; ischiadic peduncle 
  of ilium robust (also in some alvarezsaurids); supracetabular crest absent; 
  pubis fully retroverted (also in derived alvarezsaurids); small pubic boot (also 
  in coelophysoids and derived alvarezsaurids); ischia connected through extended 
  medial lamina; femoral greater trochanter anteroposteriorly expanded (also in 
  alvarezsaurids); pedal digit I robust; metatarsal II transversely wider than 
  the other metatarsals (also in <i>Tawa</i>).<br>
  <b>Other diagnoses</b>- Contra Novas et al. (2015), the premaxilla is not particularly 
  short or deep. Fine serrations are plesiomorphic for archosaurs. The coracoid 
  is subquadrangular in megalosaurids, <i>Ceratosaurus</i>, coelophysoids and 
  many basal taxa. The pubis is not more rod-like than most neotheropods, nor is the 
  pubic apron narrower. Metatarsal I is proximally compressed transversely in 
  all theropods.<br>
  If I'm correct that <i>Chilesaurus</i> is a non-neotheropod sister to <i>Daemonosaurus</i>, 
  the following suggested characters by Novas et al. also don't apply- the plate-like 
  subnarial premaxillary process is shared with <i>Daemonosaurus</i>. The absent 
  mediodistal femoral crest is true in non-averostrans (and most alvarezsaurids). 
  The distally 'triangular' calcaneum is also primitive, being seen in e.g. <i>Eoraptor</i> 
  and <i>Guaibasaurus</i>. The lack of a fibular crest, astragalar ascending process 
  lower than its body, and robust and elongate metatarsal I are also true of most 
  non-neotheropods.<br>
  <b>Comments</b>- Novas et al. (2015) state there are four paratypes, but while 
  the other SNGM-193x series are obvious possibilities, it's unknown if this assumption 
  is correct and if so, what the other paratype is (SNGM-1887 and 1888 are most 
  complete, so most likely). A manual phalanx III-1 is also reported, but which 
  specimen preserves it is unknown. Salgado et al. (2008) report "articulated 
  phalanges ... III-2, and III-3 are preserved" in SNGM-1887, but Novas et 
  al. say metacarpal III's "digit comprises a single minute phalanx." 
  There are several elements illustrated in the skeletal or coded for (e.g. cervical 
  ribs, metatarsal V), whose existence must be confirmed by future publications. 
  <br>
  Salgado et al. (2008) first reported <i>Chilesaurus</i> elements as non-tetanurine 
  Theropoda indet. (SNGM-1888, 1889, 1895, 1901) and Tetanurae indet. (SNGM-1887, 
  1894, 1898, 1900, 1903), due to the plesiomorphic tarsus and metatarsus yet 
  more derived-looking manus and keeled anterior dorsals. Once more complete specimens 
  were found, Novas et al. (2015) described them as a new taxon of non-orionidan 
  tetanurine. This was based on four datasets, but <i>Chilesaurus</i> is mis- 
  or uncoded for 12-14% of characters in at least three of them (Mortimer, online 
  2015). Once the datasets were corrected and improved, and <i>Chilesaurus</i> 
  was also analyzed in an unpublished coelurosaur matrix and Butler's ornithischian 
  matrix, the genus most parsimoniously groups with maniraptoriforms and more 
  precisely alvarezsaurids. It emerged strongly supported in that position in 
  my unpublished matrix and Nesbitt et al.'s dinosauromorph matrix once only verified 
  codings of <i>Chilesaurus</i> were used, took only 4 steps to move there without 
  any theropod characters in Butler's matrix, and is one of the most parsimonious 
  possibilities in Carrano et al.'s basal tetanurine matrix if only its verifiable 
  codings are used. A basal tetanurine position is strongly rejected if alvarezsaurids 
  are included (13 more steps in my matrix; 10 more in Butler's matrix). Yet both 
  of these placements seem unlikely due to the incongruities caused by inserting 
  <i>Chilesaurus</i> there, so that even though it's not most parsimonious, convergence 
  between <i>Chilesaurus</i> and tetanurines seems more likely than reversals 
  in <i>Chilesaurus</i>. The fact verifiable <i>Chilesaurus</i> emerges outside Neotheropoda in one of the most parsimonious trees when <i>Velociraptor</i> is excluded 
  from Nesbitt et al.'s matrix and only takes 1 more step to place there in Carrano 
  et al.'s matrix would then make sense. This would allow many characters to be 
  plesiomorphic (e.g. no fibular crest, short astragalar ascending process, large 
  pedal digit I), and also agrees with its placement close to Neotheropoda in Otero 
  and Pol's sauropodomorph-focused trees. In Nesbitt-based trees, when outside Neotheropoda, <i>Chilesaurus</i> emerged sister to <i>Daemonosaurus</i> with which 
  it shares- short snout; broad subnarial premaxillary process; three premaxillary 
  teeth (also in <i>Tawa</i>); decurved dentary; procumbant anterior teeth. However, 
  verifiable <i>Chilesaurus</i> falls out in Sauropodomorpha with 2-7 more steps, 
  and in Ornithischia with 4-8 more. So it could belong to those clades instead, 
  but more definite statements will require an osteology of the taxon to clear 
  up the coding incongruities and briefness of its original description.<br>
