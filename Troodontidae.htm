<b>Comments</b>- Paraves as a concept can apply to any topology
including <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span> and
birds, but explicit topologies were rare until the 1990s. 
Kurzanov (1981) described <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
as closer to birds than known theropods, as also assumed by Chatterjee
(1991), so would count as a paravian.  Paul (1984) placed
troodontids closer to birds than oviraptorosaurs, and in 1988 also
placed avimimids there, positioning <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
and dromaeosaurids more basal in both works.  Similarly, Thulborn
(1984) placed <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>,
tyrannosaurids, troodontids, ornithomimids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span> closer to birds than <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>,
with dromaeosaurids more basal.  Gauthier (1984, 1986) had a more
modern arrangement where deinonychosaurs (including dromaeosaurids and
troodontids) were closer to birds than caenagnathids (including <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>)
and elmisaurids.  Holtz (1992, 1994) on the other hand only placed
dromaeosaurids there, with troodontids closer to oviraptorids. 
Makovicky (1995) had a similar topology but with dromaeosaurids and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
in what will be Paraves.  Sereno (1997) first used Paraves as part
of a node-stem triplet sister to Oviraptorosauria, but without
explicitly stating its internal specifier.  This was handled by
Sereno (1998) who defined Paraves as "all maniraptorans closer to
Neornithes than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Oviraptor</span>." 
Holtz and Osmólska (2004) later added species-level specifiers. 
In the early 2000s with the discovery of bird-like basal troodontids
like <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinovenator</span>, troodontids
were consistantly paravians while <span style="font-style: italic;">Avimimus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
were near universally excluded (25 and 29 steps to add in Hartman et
al.'s 2019 matrix; they fall out as a scansoriopterygid and
dromaeosaurid respectively).  A heterodox exception is Maryanska
et al.'s (2002; also independently recovered by Lu et al., 2002)
hypothesis that oviraptorosaurs are closer to Aves than
deinonychosaurs, so that not even <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
is paravian, but this takes 12 more steps in Hartman et al.
(2019).  More recently, taxa which can controversially be
paravians include alvarezsauroids (11 steps to add; which brings
therizinosaurs as well), <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>
(11 steps to add), <span style="font-style: italic;">Yixianosaurus</span>
(7 steps to remove), <span style="font-style: italic;">Protarchaeopteryx</span>
(3 steps to add; increased to 5 steps with added oviraptorosaurs) and
scansoriopterygids (9 steps to remove).<br>
Despite
robust support for paravian monophyly, the interrelationship between
troodontids, dromaeosaurids and birds remains contentious with recent
studies alternatively favoring joining troodontids and dromaeosaurids
as Deinonychosauria (Hartman et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2018; Lefèvre et
al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017; Godefroit et al., 2013b; Senter et al.,
2012; Turner, Makovicky &amp; Norell, 2012), placing troodontids closer
to Aves than dromaeosaurids (Gianechini et al., 2018; Cau et al., 2017;
Foth and Rauhut, 2017; Lee et al., 2014; Foth et al., 2014; Godefroit
et al., 2013a), or joining dromaeosaurids and avialans to form
Eumaniraptora to the exclusion of troodontids (Agnolín &amp; Novas,
2013).  As first demonstrated by Xu et al. (2011) and Agnolín and
Novas (2011), the consensus positions of archaeopterygids as birds and
unenlagiines as dromaeosaurids can easily change with small adjustments
to the TWiG matrix, making these clades active variables in paravian
topology as well.  Indeed, Hartman et al. recovered the topology
used here as most parsimonious, but two alternatives were only one step
longer.  In one, troodontids, unenlagiids and archaeopterygids are
successively closer to birds than dromaeosaurids.  In another,
unenlagiids pair with dromaeosaurids, and troodontids pair with
archaeopterygids, all within Deinonychosauria.  These should be
considered basically equally likely pending further analyses.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Holtz (1992) originally named Eumaniraptora in his
unpublished thesis, but used it for what would now be called
Maniraptoriformes- a clade containing paravians, oviraptorosaurs,
ornithomimosaurs and also tyrannosaurids, but not <i>Ornitholestes</i>
or <i>Compsognathus</i>.
Padian et al. (1997) in an abstract named it as a new node "to unite
the stem taxa Deinonychosauria and Avialae", though without an explicit
definition.  Their definitions of Deinonychosauria and Avialae
imply a definition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
+ Aves, however.  It was first used outside an abstract by Padian
et al. (1999), and Maryanska et al. (2002) provided species-level
specifiers.<br>
Miller (2004) proposed Avemorpha for the clade including dromaeosaurids
and avialans (but not <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>),
but this is a junior synonym of Eumaniraptora.<br>
Palaeoaves is used as a paraphyletic parvclass within Avialae by
Livezey and Zusi (2007) that includes <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, <i>Rahonavis</i>,
<i>Confuciusornis</i>, enantiornithines and <i>Apsaravis</i>, but not
hesperornithines, <i>Ichthyornis</i>, lithornithids or Aves sensu
stricto. <br>
Martyniuk (2012) erected Ornithes for "&lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx lithographica</span> &amp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Passer domesticus</span>",
which is not especially useful as it could include or exclude
unenlagiids, troodontids and dromaeosaurids in trees only a steps apart
in Hartman et al.'s analysis.  <br>

?(MTCO 17966) proximal radius<br>
?(MTCO 17982) partial furcula <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Kessler (1984) noted approximately sixty bird-like
fragments from the Cornet bauxite, six of which can "with certainty be
attributed to birds." These are the holotypes of <i>Eurolimnornis
corneti</i> and <i>Palaeocursornis corneti</i> in addition to other
isolated fragments, but most have been moved to Pterosauria or more
generally Ornithodira and Archosauria indet. by Dyke et al. (2011) and
Agnolín and Varricchio (2012). <br>
MTCO 17558 was originally (Kessler and Jurcsak, 1984) decribed as a
partial carpometacarpus and paratype of <i>Limnornis corneti</i>
(later renamed <i>Palaeocursornis corneti</i>), and later (Kessler and
Jurcsak, 1986) a paratype of <i>Eurolimnornis corneti</i>. Kurochkin
(1995) used the carpometacarpus identification to argue for avian
affinities of <i>Eurolimnornis</i> due to supposed distal fusion and
tendinal sulcus, but Hope (2002) noted these are also present in <i>Ichthyornis</i>.
Hope also noted it couldn't be referred definitively to <i>Eurolimnornis</i>
or <i>Palaeocursornis</i>, and Dyke et al. reinterpreted it as a bird
proximal scapula (though they probably mistakenly wrote it is not
identifiable as a bird). <br>
MTCO 17966 and 17982 were stated to be birds by Dyke et al., but that
identity was doubted by Agnolín and Varricchio.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Peñalver et al.
(2017) describe an amber sample (AMNH Bu
JZC-F18) containing a feather, ixodid tick nymph and other
arthropods.  The feather is asymmetrical with barbules, indicating
it belonged to a eumaniraptoran.  St. Fleur's (2017) newspaper
article says "the tick was a nymph ... and that its host was most
likely some sort of fledgling dinosaur no bigger than a hummingbird,
which Dr. Grimaldi referred to as a "nanoraptor.""  Yet nothing in
Peñalver et al. suggests the age or size of the dinosaur, and the term
"nanoraptor" misleadingly suggests a deinonychosaur or oviraptorosaur
instead of an avialan.  When the article later states "the host
was more likely a nonavian dinosaur and not a modern bird based on
molecular dating", its using 'avian' in the crown Aves sense without
explicitly stating so, correlating to Peñalver et al.'s statement
"crown-group birds are excluded as possible hosts because their
inferred age is significantly younger than Burmese amber."  Yet
there are several groups such as confuciusornithiforms and
enantiornithines, the latter known from multiple specimens in Myanmar
amber, that
are plausible sources of the feather and hosts of the ixodid ticks but
which would not be considered raptors in the colloquial sense. 
It's also possible AMNH Bu JZC-F18 is from e.g. an archaeopterygid or
microraptorian, but nothing in the feather's structure or stratigraphy
has favored any particular option, and "nanoraptor" is here considered
a hypothetical animal akin to "proavis" and not a nomenclatural
suggestion for the taxon which grew the preserved feather.<br>
Xing et al. (2020) described distal wing LV-0321 which has asymmetrical
remiges with barbules, so is eumaniraptoran.  Given its size, this
is either an extremely young juvenile or an ornithothoracine, and the
plumage gives no indication of juvenile status.  Tha size of the
manual ungual compared to the phalanx is less than deinonychosaurs
except <span style="font-style: italic;">Buitreraptor</span>, but the
phalanx is not incredibly elongate as it is in that genus.  The
ratio is similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuipteryx</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Zhongornis</span> and some
ornithothoracines.  <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Deinonychosauria defined</span>- There
have been two basic suggested definitions for Deinonychosauria, one
stem-based (<i>Deinonychus</i> &lt;- <i>Passer</i>) by Padian (1997)
and the other node based (<i>Troodon</i> + dromaeosaurids) by Sereno
(1997).  I prefer Padian's because it is based on the eponymous
genus, and Colbert and Russell (1969) did not originally specify the
inclusion of troodontids. They only include dromaeosaurids in the
taxon, and only mention <i>Dromaeosaurus, Deinonychus</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>
as members of that family.  Furthermore, this gives a name to the
clade including archaeopterygids and unenlagiids in some most
parsimonious topologies and ensures Deinonychosauria does not self
destruct or include Aves.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Referral of isolated teeth</span>-
With very limited exceptions, theropod teeth with constricted roots are
from Maniraptoriformes, and except for therizinosaurs basically all
serrated varieties are from deinonychosaurs.  The only(?) known
exception is irregularily developed distal crenulations on <span style="font-style: italic;">Longipteryx</span>
premaxillary teeth (Wang et al., 2015), with supposed avialan teeth
described by Sankey et al. (2002) from the Dinosaur Park Formation not
associated with cranial or skeletal material to verify their
identity.  Thus serrated paravian teeth are here referred to
Deinonychosauria, though trees almost as short as the one used here
placed taxa with serrated teeth like troodontids as avialans.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dromaeosauria</span>- While the term
'dromaeosaur' is a common short form of dromaeosaurid, use of
Dromaeosauria itself is much rarer in the published literature. 
The earliest example of the latter may be Bonaparte and Novas (1985)
who seem to treat Dromaeosauria (containing at least <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>)
as a theropod group on par with Carnosauria and Segnosauria. 
Similarly, Dubois (2006) proposed Dromaeosauria alongside Aves at the
level of phalanx, between family and order, but his scheme of new
Linnaean levels was not widely adopted.  Fossilworks (online 2007)
presents Chatterjee and Templin (2007) as the authors of Dromaeosauria,
who use it in a cladogram as a eumaniraptoran clade containing <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Pedopenna</span>, sister to Aves (Avialae
in official usage).  Other examples are mistakes for
Dromaeosauridae or Eudromaeosauria.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tetrapterygidae</span>- Chatterjee
(2015) proposed the family Tetrapterygidae for a clade including <i>Microraptor</i>,
<i>Xiaotingia</i>, <i>Anchiornis</i> and <i>Aurornis</i>. However, as
noted by Martyniuk (online, 2015), according to ICZN Article 11.7.11 a
family-group name must be "formed from the stem of an available generic
name" which "must be a name then used as valid in the new family-group
taxon." As Chatterjee did not intend for Tetrapterygidae to include a
genus <i>Tetrapteryx</i>, it is invalid. Furthermore, <i>Tetrapteryx</i>
has already been used for a genus of gruid bird (Thunberg, 1818),
corrently considered a synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Anthropoides</span>.
Finally, if <i>Microraptor</i> is in a family, the family must be
named Microraptoridae because that family was already erected by
Longrich and Currie (2009). <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Weigert (1995) assigned these teeth to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx sp.</span>.<br>
These teeth are constricted basally, with mesial and distal carinae.
Both lingual and labial surfaces are generally smooth, and the lingual
surface is concave apically. The labial surface sometimes has faint
grooves, which were believed to be from wear. Eighty-six teeth have
both mesial and distal serrations, while the other seventeen sometimes
lack mesial serrations and have carinae shifted lingually, so are
probably premaxillary teeth. The teeth average 1.65 mm in crown height
and .60 mm in FABL. Serrations are low and rounded or slightly pointed,
with a miniscule size of 24/mm.<br>
The specimens differ from <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and most other
archaeopterygids in having serrations. Weigert (1995) states these may
be present but hidden in the former genus, since most <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
teeth are only visible in labial view, where the serrations cannot be
seen in the Portuguese specimens. Yet the London and Munich specimens
of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> both expose serrationless teeth in lingual
view, showing Weigert is incorrect. He explained the absence of
serrations in the Munich specimen by claiming it was a distinct species
(<i>A. bavarica</i>) which may have differed from <i>A. lithographica</i>
in this respect, but this is special pleading, and the distinctness of <i>A.
bavarica</i> is very poorly supported (see discussion in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
entry). The diagonally oriented carina on the apical half of the tooth
is described as an archaeopterygiform apomorphy, but this is true of
any teeth which share the same stout, highly recurved outline (e.g. <i>Sinornithoides</i>).
The other cited archaeopterygiform apomorphy is the lingually projected
mesial carina, but this is found in other taxa such as <i>Sinornithosaurus'</i>
anterior teeth. The teeth do seem to be maniraptoriform, based on the
constricted crown base, and are not referrable to several groups due to
their serrations (Ornithomimosauria, Alvarezsauroidea,
Oviraptorosauria, Avialae), but also lack the enlarged serrations found
in most therizinosaurs and derived troodontids.<br>

makes this plausible.  Wang et al. found that "the small size of

more consistent with some early-diverging paravian clades than with
oviraptorosaurs or other theropods (e.g., Anchiornithidae..." and
further that "The slight cranioventral orientation of the pubis is
plesiomorphic among maniraptorans and excludes this specimen from
late-diverging deinonychosaurs, therizinosaurids, parvicursorines or
avialans."  Notably the large obturator process excludes this
specimen from Avialae in the current topology, making it likely to be a
deinonychosaur.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Jin et al. (2008) reassign <i>Jinfengopteryx</i>'s
horizon to the Qiaotou Member of the Huajiying Formation, as opposed to
the Qiaotau Formation which was stated in Ji et al. (2005). Ji et al.'s
labeled "pterygoid" looks to be a parasphenoid rostrum, the "squamosal"
part of the parietal. Turner (2008) redescribed the skull in his thesis.<br>
Though Ji et al. (2005) assign it to the Archaeopterygidae, I first
noted a resemblence to troodontids (Mortimer, DML 2005). Xu and Norell
(2006) stated <i>Jinfengopteryx</i> was a possible troodontid based on
"general body plan" and several undisclosed dental features. It has
been more recently placed in basal Troodontidae (Brusatte et al., 2014;
Lee et al., 2014) or basal Paraves (Foth et al., 2014).  Hartman
et al. (2019) found an unstable position in Troodontidae further from <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinusonasus</span>,
but one step could move it to basal Deinonychosauria, where later
alterations of the matrix placed it.  Three steps move it to
Archaeopterygidae, while 4 steps move it to basal Paraves.  <br>

in December 2003 and first reported by Martin and Case (2005) who
stated it was a theropod where "the foot structure seems very primitive
for a carnivorous dinosaur existing at the end of the Mesozoic", which
"does not appear to be related to North American dinosaurs" and instead
"appears to be a primitive holdover of the original Gondwanan dinosaur
assemblage."  Case et al. (2007) described the specimen, placing
it in Dromaeosauridae and stating it "more closely resembles Early
Cretaceous dromaeosaurs such as <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span> rather than
contemporaneous dromaeosaurids, <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span> or regional
close (i.e. South American) species like <span style="font-style: italic;">Neuquenraptor</span> ... or <span style="font-style: italic;">Buitreraptor</span>"
and "may in fact be a latest Cretaceous remnant of the Early
Cretaceous, cosmopolitan, basal stock of dromaeosaurids."  While
this echos Martin and Case's idea, <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span> have
universally been regarded as closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
than unenlagiines.  Their reasons for placing it basally are "the
juxtaposition of the ascending process of the astragalus and the
anterior distal tibia without a well-defined fossa on the tibia" which
is true for almost all pennaraptorans and "the incipient ginglymoidal
MtII/digit II joint" which is indeed unlike dromaeosaurids and
unenlagiines, as also noted by Turner et al. (2012) who thus assigned
it to Deinonychosauria incertae sedis.  Ely and Case (2016)
recovered the taxon as the most basal deinonychosaur, sister to
troodontids plus dromaeosaurids, in an unpublished analysis.  Ely
and Case (2019) later officially described and named the specimen,
including it in Gianechini et al.'s TWiG analysis where it fell out in
Paraves in a polytomy with eudromaeosaurian and anchiornithine
OTUs.  While the authors seem to favor a basal position as in
their 2016 abstract, their analyses suggests an anchiornithine
troodontid or eudromaeosaurian dromaeosaurid placement are about
equally supported.  Lamanna et al. (2019) state "Several of the
present authors are
currently undertaking a comprehensive reassessment of the morphology
and phylogenetic rel ationships of <span style="font-style: italic;">Imperobator</span>
that will include a
description of all known material of this taxon."  Entering data
from Ely and Case (2019) into the Hartman et al. maniraptoromorph
analysis indicates a deinonychosaurian placement more derived than <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinfengopteryx</span> and outside
Unenlagiinae and Troodontidae plus Dromaeosauridae.  <br>
The materials list has been inconsistent between publications, with
Case et al. describing "two teeth that were preserved in a fragment of
concretion", Ely and Case (2019) mentioning no cranial material, but
Lammana et al. (2019) reporting Case and Malinzak relocated "additional
material pertaining to UCMP 276000 at facilities of Eastern Washington
University and the South Dakota School of Mines and<br>
Technology, respectively, including skull fragments (probably belonging
to at least the premaxilla, maxilla, and/or dentary), a caudal
vertebra, and additional teeth and pedal elements", similar to Lammana
et al. (2017)'s statement "undescribed craniodental fragments of this
theropod individual collected during [2003], initially thought missing,
were recently relocated in the collections of the South Dakota School
of Mines and Technology."  Case et al. state "the left tibia is
the most complete of the two tibia fragments" but Ely and Case state
"only the distal left tibia is preserved."  Ely and Case state
"potential material from digit I may be present (Fig. 7D). It is
distinguished by what may be a prominent flexor heel on the
proximoventral surface, morphologically similar to that of the
dromaeosaurid (avialan?) <i>Balaur bondoc</i> (Csiki et al. 2010)",
implying a pedal ungual I, but 7D seems to be the proximal half of a
non-ungual phalanx positioned as III-1 in Case et al..  In the
materials list, Ely and Case also state "material from metatarsal I,
and even metatarsal V may be preserved", but we get no description or
illustration of these.  While the illustrated and described pedal
material is from the left pes, Ely and Case state "only a few fragments
from the right pes" are preserved, of which the only elements specified
in either paper are "distal ends of metatarsals II and III" by Case et
al..  Note in Case et al.'s photo of the left pes, distal
metatarsal IV and phalanx IV-I figured by Ely and Case are missing, but
three small fragments positioned as one part of digit III and two parts
of digit IV are shown by Case et al. but not mentioned by Ely and Case
except perhaps when they say "a small portion of the ungual [IV?] is
also present."<br>
Lamanna et al. (2017) report "a partial tooth, possible craniodental
fragments, and part of a pedal ungual" were discovered at the type
locality in 2011 or 2016, belonging to the type individual. 
Lamanna et al. (2019) confirms these were found in both years,
"including a tooth and several bone fragments (AMNH FARB 30894), a
partial pedal ungual, and fragmentary putative cranial remains."<br>

<b>Ex-archaeopterygids</b>- Several taxa have been referred to
Archaeopterygidae or <i>Archaeopteryx</i> itself in the past, but do
not belong there. Janensch (1914) first noted an <i>Archaeopteryx</i>-like
supposed carpometacarpus (HMN coll.) from the Tendaguru Formation of
Tanzania, but this is based on a misreading of Stremme (1916-1919), who
was describing differences from <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. This was named <i>Stremmeia</i>
by Nopcsa (1930) and reidentified as a salientian tibiofibulare, and
while this identification has been doubted by late twentieth century
authors, the specimen is also highly dissimilar to maniraptoran
elements. Lambrecht (1933) noted a specimen labeled <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
"vicensensis" at the Museum zu Vicensa, but found it was a pterosaur
after writing Kleinschmidt. Jensen (1981) identified a proximal femur
(BYU 2023) from the Morrison Formation as <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, but
this is placed as Ornithodesmiformes incertae sedis here. Kessler and
Jurcsak (1984) described an incomplete supposed humerus (MTCO 14422)
from the Early Cretaceous of Romania as <i>Archaeopteryx sp.</i>, but
this was reidentified by Dyke et al. (2011) as a long bone of
Archosauria indet.. Paul (1988) referred all dromaeosaurids to
Archaeopterygidae, which has not been recovered in any phylogenetic
analysis. "Proornis" was originally called "the North Korean <i>Archaeopteryx</i>"
(e.g. Anonymous, 1994), but is actually a confuciusornithid (Gao et
al., 2009). Weigert (1995) described 103 teeth from the Guimarota
Formation of Portugal as cf. <i>Archaeopteryx sp.</i>, but they may
belong to a basal deinonychosaur instead. <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i> was
assigned to the family by Ji and Ji (1997) and Paul (2002), but is
probably a basal oviraptorosaur. Forster et al. (1998) found <i>Rahonavis</i>
and <i>Unenlagia</i> to clade with <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
in some most parsimonious trees, but these are now considered members
of their own clade Unenlagiidae which is closer to either
dromaeosaurids or birds.  Rauhut (2002) referred <i>Paronychodon</i>
to Archaeopterygidae, but this was based on comparisons to the
Guimarota teeth noted above and the genus is here assigned to
Troodontidae based on enamel microstructure. Ji et al. (2005) described
<i>Jinfengopteryx</i> as being more closely related to <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
than to Aves, but is now recognized as a basal troodontid or basal
paravian. Xu et al. (2011) recently used a version of Senter's TWiG
analysis to refer <i>Xiaotingia</i> to Archaeopterygidae, but the
genus has also been placed as a basal troodontid and basal
dromaeosaurid.<br>
<b>Sauriurae</b>- Sauriurae was a group first used by Haekel (1866) for
<i>Archaeopteryx</i>, who placed modern birds in the Ornithurae
instead. This taxonomy was followed for over a century, with
hesperornithines and ichthyornithines being added to Ornithurae by
later authors. Martin (1983) was the first author to place
enantiornithines in Sauriurae, which has been followed near universally
by those who doubt the dinosaur-bird relationship. Additional taxa have
also been assigned to Sauriurae including <i>Confuciusornis</i> (Hou
et al., 1995), <i>Sinosauropteryx</i> (Ji and Ji, 1996), <i>Protarchaeopteryx</i>
(Ji and Ji, 1997), <i>Yandangornis</i> (Cai and Zhao, 1999), <i>Caudipteryx</i>
(Martin and Czerkas, 2000), <i>Jeholornis</i> (Martin, 2004), <i>Vorona</i>
(Kurochkin, 2006), and lately all deinonychosaurs and oviraptorosaurs
(Martin, 2004). The group has basically consisted of any
non-euornithine birds considered by the authors, with the notable
exception of Kurochkin (2006), who places <i>Protoavis</i> and
confuciusornithids in Euornithes (his Ornithurae) and views sauriurines
as being theropods while euornithurines are not. While there may be
some evidence for placing confuciusornithids and enantiornithines in a
group exclusive of Aves, phylogenetic analyses are unanimous in
rejecting a clade of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and enantiornithines which
excludes Aves. <br>

in longer metacarpal I (45% of mcIII length vs. 41% and 42%), manual
ungual I shorter than metacarpal I, and longer metatarsus (~60% of
tibial length vs. 52% and 51%)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Meyer (1857)
initially identified the specimen as a pterosaur and distinguished it
from other known pterosaurs by the shorter metacarpals I-III, longer
manual digits I-III, longer metatarsus and smaller unguals.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 1855,
Meyer (1857) named TM 6928/6929 <i>Pterodactylus</i> <i>crassipes</i>,
finding the manual proportions and ungual size most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Dimorphodon</span> (then <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterodactylus macronyx</span>).  Due
to incompleteness, Meyer wrote "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">it would not be
impossible that <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterodactylus
crassipes</span> also represented a <span style="font-style: italic;">Rhamphorynchus</span>,
which will decide on the attachment of the head or tail. If the
assumption is confirmed, the species would be called <span style="font-style: italic;">Rhamphorynchus crassipes</span>."</span> 
As ICZN Article 11.5.1 states "A name proposed conditionally for a
taxon before 1961 is not to be excluded on that account alone", this is
an available name as well.  Meyer (1859/1860) described it in more
detail and illustrated a slab.  The only other author to consider
the
specimen was Wellnhofer (1970), who believed it to be a
rhamphorhynchoid based on "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">the
short metacarpus, the long metatarsus, the shape of the prebubis and
the strikingly large claws on the hands and feet."  </span>Furthermore,
he stated "<span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en">the
comparison of "<span style="font-style: italic;">Pt</span>." <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaphognathus crassirostris</span>
reveals broad similarities both in size and morphology of individual
skeletal elements (prebubis, femur, claws). Although the existing
remains of "<span style="font-style: italic;">Pt.</span>" <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> are not sufficient to
make a specific association with <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaphognathus
crassirostris</span>, both specimens may certainly be considered
congeneric" and on page 122 reidentified <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> as <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaphognathus sp.</span>.  </span>While
the combination <span style="font-style: italic;">Scaphognathus
crassipes</span>
could be implied from Wellnhofer's statement, it was not used
explicitly until Olshevsky (1991) who listed it without
attribution.  <br>
Ostrom (1970) identified the specimen as <i>Archaeopteryx</i> cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">lithographica</span>,
stating "the present remains are much too fragmentary for positive
species identification" before describing it in detail two years later
(1972b) as <span style="font-style: italic;">A. lithographica</span>. 
His in depth study concluded "With the exception of the apparent
difference in pubis position, the Teyler specimen does not differ in
any other significant way from the London and Solnhofen specimens of <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>.
The limb elements are slightly more robust and apparently were slightly
longer than those of the Berlin specimen. In summary, I see no
morphologic evidence to exclude this specimen from the same taxon as
the other three."  This was problematic because "the specific name
<span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> is a senior synonym
of <span style="font-style: italic;">lithographica</span>", yet "the
species name <span style="font-style: italic;">A. lithographica</span>
is well known and firmly established in the zoologic literature. 
It
therefore seems undesirable to suppress that term in favor of the
senior subjective synonym."  Thus Ostrom (1972a) petitioned the
ICZN to
"(a) use its plenary powers to suppress the species name <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> Meyer, 1857, as published
in the binomen <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterodactylus
crassipes</span>, for purposes of the Law of Priority but not for those
of the Law of Homonymy : (b) place the specific name <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span>
(as suppressed under the plenary powers in (a) above) on the Official
Index of Rejected and Invalid Specific Names in Zoology."  Nye
(1974)
and Eisenmann (1974) wrote Comments to the ICZN arguing that cases of
subjective synonymy such as this, the senior synonym should not be
completely suppressed in case it is later thought to be a distinct
taxon.  Ostrom and the ICZN agreed, so that in 1977 Melville
issued the
narrower Opinion 1070 that "the specific name <span style="font-style: italic;">lithographica</span> von Meyer, 1861, as
published in the binomen <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx
lithographica</span>, is to be given precedence over the specific name <span style="font-style: italic;">crassipes</span> von Meyer, 1857, as
published in the binomen <span style="font-style: italic;">Pterodactylus
crassipes</span> by any zoologist who believes that the two specific
names apply to the same taxon."<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Lefèvre et
al., 2017) four anterior maxillary teeth twice as long as the others;
distal end of posteroventral coracoid process thicker than proximal
part to form a rounded bump; distal tip of ischium narrow and strongly
deflected dorsally to form a hook.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Lefèvre et al.
(2017) listed "coracoid tuber well-developed and laterally projected
from the lateral margin of the coracoid and forming a subglenoid shelf
along the caudoventral margin of the bone" as diagnostic compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>, but this is due to
perspective and so is true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimens with more posteriorly exposed coracoids (e.g. BMNHC
Ph 822).  The "smooth ventral side of coracoid devoid of small
pits" is primitive compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype is one
of several paravian specimens acquired by the YFGP from a fossil dealer
prior to June 2012.  It was labeled YFGP-T5201 in the poster of
Brougham (2013, online), which is probably a mistake (see entry for
YFGP-T5201).<br>
Lefèvre et al. (2017) assigned a subadult stage to the holotype based
on a mix of juvenile ("bone extremities are rough in appearance"; "an
uneven periosteal surface which indicates that periosteal growth was
still occurring at the time of death") and adult (completely fused
sacral vertebrae; completely fused caudal neurocentral sutures)
features.<br>
Brougham (2013, online) recovered the specimen in a clade with <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span> using Turner's
dromaeosaurid and Xu's <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiaotingia</span>
TWiG matrices and Cau's <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>
matrix.  Lefèvre et al. (2017) used a version of Cau's matrix to
recover this as a basal paravian sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>, in a clade with <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Pedopenna</span>.  Hartman et al.

(8.6 mm)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Xu et al,
2023; autapomorphies only) metacarpals I and II have asymmetric
ginglymoid distal articulations with enlarged medial condyles; short
ischium that has distally located obturator process and distodorsal
process; tibia twice as long as femur.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype was
discovered between October 14 and November 14 2022.  Xu et al.'s
(2023)
reporting summary states "The holotype of Fujianvenator rapidus (IVPP
V31985) was discovered in Daxi Basin near Yangyuan Village, Zhenghe
Country, Nanping City, Fujian Province, Southeast China" three times,
making this a likely early name for the species. Note the entire
specimen is broken between slab and counterslab so that elements are
preserved in section, and often have broken or confluent edges. 
While
Xu et al. only state the trunk "consists of 10-12 articulated
vertebrae", the counterslab's presacral column extends about three
vertebrae anterior to thie eleven preserved on the slab although no
morphologies are visible.  This makes the cervicodorsal transition
unknowable, but the right pectoral girdle is placed properly for a
series of thirteen dorsals, and an elongate rib below the 'third'
dorsal on the slab indicates at least eleven were present.  While
the
interpreted figures show two structures labeled "?sv" which have the
outlines of two series of sacrals with potential anterior sacrals shown
below the right ilium, only the last element of the more ventral
'series' is obvious in the specimen (slab side) with an adjacent
fragment potentially being part of the previous vertebra.  The
first
caudal centrum as shown articulating with the rest of the tail does not
seem to be present, but the slab shows what may be a first caudal
neural arch just dorsal to this position.  Indeed, while the
authors
say "Considering the articulated vertebral column, the proximity of the
ilium and caudal vertebrae and the position of two possible caudalmost
sacral vertebrae, one or two additional vertebrae might have been
present anterior to those eight centra", it seems more natural to
suggest the supposed last sacral centrum belongs to the apparent first
caudal neural arch directly above it.  While the text claims the
"tail
preserves only eight anterior vertebrae with recognizable features",
Figure 1a shows the slab preserves nothing past the anteroventral
corner of caudal six, and Figure 2a-b shows nothing identifiable past
the anterior half of caudal seven in the counterslab.  No
structure is
present where the figure labels the right coracoid (area only preserved
on the counterslab), but a piece just proximal to the right humerus may
be its distal portion, or may be part of the right humeral head. 
The
supposed right scapholunare ("radiale") is considered here more similar
to a semilunate carpal in shape, while the supposed right pisiform
("ulnare") is either fragmented or partially covered by sediment and if
the latter is more likely to be the actual semilunate based on its
position and the carpals of related taxa.  The medial and lateral
condyles of the right astragalocalcaneum are switched in the
figures. 
Contra the interpretive drawing that shows two small pedal phalanges in
side view next to pedal phalanx III-1, this instead appears to be the
distal end of right metatarsal II in dorsal view, being continuous with
the proximal portion and the correct length.  Xu et al. state "The
specimen is not skeletally mature, given the unfused
metacarpals and tibiotarsus. On the basis of the closed neurocentral
sutures of the dorsal vertebrae, the fused astragalus and calcaneum and
the ossified sternum, we interpret IVPP V31985 as a subadult."<br>
Xu et al. (2023) used a version of Brusatte's TWiG analysis to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Fujianvenator</span>
as an anchiornithid in a polytomy with other members.  When added
to my maniraptoromorph matrix from Hartman et al. 2019, it resolves

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>-
Xu et al. (2008) suggested a short ischium (less than one-fourth of the
femoral length) as being diagnostic, but the holotype's ischium is only
partially exposed and of published measured specimens only YFGP-T5199
has such a short ischium (23%).  Other specimens (41HIII 0404 32%;
41HIII 0415 29%; BMNHC Ph 804 37%; BMNHC Ph 823 33%; LPM-B00169 34%)
are
longer than <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>
(28%) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>
(27%).  They also listed 'ventral surface of coracoid sculptured
by numerous small pits' as diagnostic, but this seems present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span> as well (unexposed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>).<br>
Hu et al. (2009) suggested an elongate tibiotarsus as diagnostic, but
the tibiofemoral ratios in e.g. 41HIII 0404 and BMNHC Ph 823 are the
same or less than <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>
and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>.<br>
Pei et al. (2017) listed several characters that were also stated to be
present in other 'anchiornithines'- straight nasal process of
premaxilla; short anterior ramus of  maxilla; ventrally displaced
promaxillary fenestra; sheet-like posteroventral process of
dentary; deltopectoral crest no
longer than one-fourth of humeral shaft; straight ulna;
straight radius; fibula with
extremely expanded proximal end as anteroposteriorly broad as tibia.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype
was discovered by a farmer (Hu et al., 2009) and given to the IVPP
before October 2008.  Foth and Rauhut (2017) include high
resolution photos of the holotype manus.  <br>
Jiang (2011) describes complete skeleton C.0502 as a new species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
in a thesis.  Though described as having thirteen dorsals and four
sacrals, the supposed last dorsal appears to be a first sacral. 
The ilium is reconstructed with a very short preacetabular process, but
it is near certainly just broken.  <br>
While Xu et al. (2008) used a version of the Theropod Working Group
matrix with added characters from Xu's thesis to place <i>Anchiornis</i>
as an avialan more basal than <i>Archaeopteryx</i>, Hu et al. (2009)
used Senter's version of the TWiG matrix to place it as a troodontid
more derived than <i>Sinovenator</i> but less so than <i>Mei</i> and
other taxa. Xu et al. (2011) found it to be an archaeopterygid, with
that group basal in Deinonychosauria.  Hartman et al. (2019) found
<span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
to be an archaeopterygid, which resolved as basal deinonychosaurs, or
with one extra step sister to troodontids or basal avialans.  Its
monophyly relative to <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span> has not been
established.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (YFGP-T5198) (510 mm adult) skull (57 mm), mandibles,
seven cervical vertebrae (series 62 mm), cervical ribs, eleven dorsal
vertebrae (series 97 mm), dorsal ribs, synsacrum (30 mm), about thirty
caudal vertebrae (series 265 mm), chevrons, scapulae (36.6 mm),
coracoid, furcula, humeri (58 mm), radii, ulnae (57 mm), scapholunare,
pisiform, semilunate carpal, metacarpal I (12 mm), phalanx I-1 (27 mm),
manual ungual I, metacarpals II (34 mm), phalanx II-1 (14.5 mm),
incomplete phalanx II-2, metacarpals III (34.5 mm), phalanx III-1,
phalanx III-2, phalanx III-3, incomplete manual ungual III, ilia (34.8
mm), pubes (55 mm), ischia (~18 mm), femora (66 mm), tibiotarsi (90.5
mm), partial metatarsal I, phalanx I-1, pedal ungual I, metatarsi (44
mm), phalanges II-1 (7 mm), phalanx II-2 (9 mm), pedal ungual II,
phalanges III-1 (12 mm), phalanx III-2 (6.5 mm), phalanx III-3 (6 mm),
pedal ungual III (7.5 mm), phalanges IV-1, phalanx IV-2, phalanx IV-3
(5 mm), phalanx IV-4 (5 mm), pedal ungual IV (7 mm), body feathers<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified after Godefroit et al., 2013) manual
phalanx I-1 distinctly more robust than radius; robust postacetabular
process of ilium not markedly deflected ventrally and with horizontal
dorsal margin; distal end of ischium dorsoventrally expanded and formed
by hook-like ventral process delimiting a prominent distal obturator
notch and by a longer dorsal distal process.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Godefroit et al. also list "metatarsal I
gracile and elongate (about 30% of metatarsal III length)", but this is
erroneous (see below).<br>
Pei et al. (2017) claimed "The posterior (= postacetabular) process of
the right ilium of YFGP-T5198 is more squared than in other <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>,
but the left posterior (= postacetabular) process of YFGP-T5198 is
dorsoventrally shallow and has a posteroventrally sloping dorsal edge
as in other <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimens (e.g., IVPP V14378, LPMB00169, BMNHC Ph 804, BMNHC Ph 822,
and
BMNHC Ph 823)", but the left ilium seems to be in dorsal view.  <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The identification of some elements by Godefroit et
al. (2013) is questionable. Instead of the surangular and angular being
equal in depth as reconstructed, there is a suture showing the angular
was much shallower as is usual for maniraptorans. The third manual
digit is reconstructed as having two elongate proximal phalanges and a
partially preserved third phalanx that would almost certainly make it
longer than digit II. While the poor preservation and photo quality
make any identification uncertain, there is a lateral bend halfway
through and a short medial concavity that would support their phalanx
III-1 being both III-1 and III-2. Thus their III-2 would be III-3, and
their III-3 fragment would be most of ungual III, resembling the
proportions of other basal paravians. Finally, metatarsal I is shown as
being a third as long as III and untapered proximally, unlike any
theropod. This apparent structure is formed by parts of the main
metatarsal shafts before their surface is broken away more proximally.
There does seem to be a small fragment of metatarsal I conntected to
phalanx I-1.<br>
The
holotype is one of several paravian specimens acquired by the YFGP from
a fossil dealer prior to June 2012. Pei et al. (2017) considered this
probably a junior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis
huxleyi</span>.<br>
The authors resolved <i>Aurornis</i> as a basal avialan using a
reduced version of Cau's matrix, similar to Lee et al.'s (2014) later
iteration of this matrix. Brusatte et al. (2014) found it to be a basal
troodontid, however. All of these trees had the genus closely related
to <i>Eosinopteryx</i> and <i>Anchiornis</i>, which are tentatively
placed as archaeopterygids here.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Brougham (2013) added "three new undescribed Tiaojishan theropods" to
three coelurosaur matrices, which his publically available poster
(Brougham, online 2013) shows are labeled as YFGP-T5199, YFGP-T5200 and
YFGP-T5201.  However, YFGP-T5199 has since been described as an <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimen (Lindgren et al., 2015; also figured in Lefèvre et al., 2017)
which is not the same as Brougham figured.  Lefèvre et al. (2014)
also lists these three specimen numbers, but states "rectrices are well
developed along the tail of YFGP-T5200", while Lefèvre et al.'s (2015)
description of YFGP-T5200 corresponds to "YFGP-T5199" in Brougham's
poster.  Thus Brougham's numbers are incorrectly associated with
specimens.  Regardless, Brougham recovered all of these specimens
in a clade with <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>, Lefèvre et al. (2014)
stated they were "basalmost Avialae" which is where Cau's matrix
recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>-grade
taxa at the time, and Lefèvre et al. (2015) found YFGP-T5200 to be "a
basalmost Avialae forming a basal clade with <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span>."  They are thus here
assigned to Archaeopterygidae, where the Hartman et al. matrix
recovered <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>.<br>
As described by Lefèvre et al. (2015), YFGP-T5200 has symmetrical
remiges, metatarsal remiges and retrices, with no barbules and the
retrices extend down most of the tail as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>.<br>

YFGP-T199 is actually YFGP-T5200, and the actual YFGP-T5199 <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span> specimen is not
pictured.  The other pictured specimens besides <span style="font-style: italic;">Aurornis</span> (YFGP-T5198) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span> (YFGP-T5197) are the
then-undescribed <span style="font-style: italic;">Serikornis</span>
(PMOL-AB00200; labeled YFGP-T5201) and an otherwise unpublished
specimen (labeled YFGP-T5200).  Thus unless <span style="font-style: italic;">Serikornis</span>
originally had a YFGP number, YFGP-5201 is assumed to be the skeleton
in side view with no obvious remiges or retrices and an elongated
upcurved snout.  Brougham recovered all of these specimens in a

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Godefroit et al., 2013) short tail, composed
of 20 caudal vertebrae, 2.7 times length of the femur.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Contra
Godefroit et al.'s (2013) character "short snout, about 82% the length
of the orbit", Pei et al. (2017) noted the snout "is broken and
incomplete, and thus cannot be used for comparison" and that "the
anteroposterior length of the preorbital portion of the skull is about
1.5-2 times that of the orbit, which is the same as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>."  Contra Godefroit
et al.'s character "lacrimal with long posterior process participating
in about half the length of dorsal margin of orbit and a vestigial
anterior process", Pei et al. say "The lacrimal of [<span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimen] BMNHC Ph 804 has both long anterior and posterior processes,
but both processes are extremely slender and easy to break, so the
longer posterior process of the lacrimal is not a reliable diagnostic
feature of <span style="font-style: italic;">Eosinopteryx</span>." 
Contra Godefroit et al.'s character "chevrons reduced to small rod-like
elements below the 8th or 9th caudal", Pei et al. state "Reduced
chevrons below the proximal 8th or 9th caudal vertebrae are observed in
other <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span> specimens,
such as BMNHC Ph 804 and BMNHC Ph 822."  Contra Godefroit et al.'s
character "ilium with proportionally long, low and distally tapering
postacetabular process (ratio 'length/height at midlength' = 5)", Pei
et al. state "a long and low posterior (= postacetabular) process of
the ilium is also present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
(e.g., IVPP V14378, BMNHC Ph 804, BMNHC Ph 822, and BMNHC Ph
823)." 
Contra Godefroit et al.'s character "pedal unguals shorter than
corresponding penultimate phalanges", Pei et al. suggest "<span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimens have variation in proportions of pedal phalanges, even within
the same specimen, such as in BMNHC Ph 804." Finally, contra Godefroit
et al.'s character "absence of rectrices (versus other paravians with
preserved plumage) and feathers on metatarsus and pes (versus other
troodontids with preserved plumage on the hindlimb)", Pei et al. state
"The absence of rectrices and feathers on the metatarsus is possibly a
preservational artifact, as many <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span>
specimens only have feathers associated with few bones instead of the
entire body."<br>
<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype is one of several paravian specimens acquired by the YFGP
from a fossil dealer prior to June 2012. Plumage differences from e.g. <i>Anchiornis</i>
are here seen as questionable, as other specimens which should
originally possess pennaceous feathers on wings/tail also lack them,
presumably due to preservation (<i>Longipteryx</i> holotype, NGMC 91, <i>Epidexipteryx</i>).
Godefroit et al. (2013) claimed neurocentral and tibiotarsal fusion
indicated a subdult or adult age, but Lefèvre et al. (2014) found
histology showed it was immature.<br>
The authors resolved <i>Eosinopteryx</i> as a basal troodontid using a
version of Senter's TWiG matrix. Brusatte et al. (2014) also found <i>Eosinpteryx</i>
to be a basal troodontid, while Foth et al. (2014) and Lee et al.
(2014) both recovered it as a basal avialan closer to birds than
troodontids. All of these trees had the genus closely related to <i>Aurornis</i>
and <i>Anchiornis</i>, which are tentatively placed as
archaeopterygids here.<br>

Elzanowski  (2002) listed several characters of his
Archaeopterygidae that are plesiomorphic (four premaxillary teeth;
premaxilla projects anterior to mandible; 23 presacral vertebrae; five
sacral vertebrae; no hypocleidium on furcula).  An absent external
mandibular fenestra is probably true in other archaeopterygids, a mid
dorsal ischial process is common in basal paravians.<br>
Rauhut et al. (2018) note 'a longitudinal groove on the medial side of

so this is an archaeopterygid character.  Similarly, they state

<b>London specimen and feather</b>-
Meyer (1861a) first mentioned and described a feather (BSP 1869 VIII 1;
MB.Av.100) discovered in Spring or Summer 1861 (published August 16th),
but did not name
it.  Wellnhofer (2009) notes that
a discovery in 1860 is sometimes reported but that there is no evidence
it was that long prior to the September 15 publication of Meyer
1861a.  Meyer later (1861b) referred to the feather and mentioned
the
then undescribed London specimen noticed in Haberlein's collections the
Summer of that year, stating that
"For the denomination of the animal I consider the term <i>Archaeopteryx
lithographica</i> as appropriate", but exactly which specimen (if not
both) he considered "the animal" is ambiguous. The title suggests the
feather is the holotype, but this was written by an anonymous editor.
In his later (1862a) paper, he indicates the name <i>Archaeopteryx
lithographica</i> was meant to be tied to the feather, making it the
holotype ("The fossil feather presented by me may come from a similar
animal, for which I have chosen the denomination <i>Archaeopteryx
lithographica</i>"). This was misunderstood by many subsequent authors,
including de Beer (1954), who have viewed the London specimen as the
holotype instead. Wagner (1962a) described the London specimen as a new
genus of pterosaur- <i>Griphosaurus</i>,
as Meyer's 1861b paper had not been published at the time of Wagner's
presentation (November 9, 1861). While Wagner's paper was dated 1861,
it wasn't published until January 20th, 1862 (Swinton, 1960), but an
English translation was published in April 1862 (Wagner, 1862b).
Woodward (1962) used the name <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>, but
stated Owen would describe the London species under the name <i>Griphornis
longicaudatus</i>. A footnote indicates Owen had decided to retain the
name <i>Archaeopteryx</i> though, as indeed did happen in his 1863
paper. More confusingly, Woodward uses the name "<i>Griphosaurus
problematicus</i> Wagner, 1861" in the plate label for the London
specimen, though Wagner never used a species name in his 1862 ("1861")
publication. Owen (1863a) made the London specimen the holotype of his
new species <i>Archaeopteryx macrura</i> (misspelled <i>macrurus</i>
in his 1863a publication, but corrected in 1863b), since he considered
its feathers different from the <i>A. lithographica</i> holotype.
Several later authors followed Owen's usage (Dames, 1884; Lambrecht,
1933). The new combination <i>Griphosaurus longicaudatus</i> has been
listed as deriving from Owen (1862), but Bühler and Bock (2002)
indicate this was a mistaken attribution by Brodkorb (1963).
Petronievics (1921) used the name <i>Archaeopteryx oweni</i> for the
London specimen without justification, so it is clearly a junior
synonym. In 1960, Swinton petitioned the ICZN to place <i>Archaeopteryx
lithographica</i> on the Official List of Generic/Specific Names in
Zoology, and to add <i>Griphosaurus</i>, <i>Griphornis longicaudatus</i>,
<i>Griphosaurus problematicus</i>, <i>Archaeopteryx macrurus</i> and <i>Archaeopteryx
oweni</i> to the Official Index of Rejected and Invalid
Generic/Specific Names in Zoology, which was upheld by Riley and China
in 1961 as Opinion #607.  Eisenmann (1974) in a comment to the
ICZN proposed ruling the London specimen is the type of <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx lithographica</span>, but
the issue was not taken up by the commission at the time.  Bock
and Bühler (2007) petitioned the ICZN to make the London specimen the
neotype of <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>,
since authors have interpreted Meyer's intent in different ways, and
nearly all references have based the taxon on the more diagnostic
skeleton as opposed to the feather.  Kadolsky (2008) further noted
"the skeleton find (the later BMNH specimen no. 37001) is not
described, diagnosed or characterised by even a single word, nor is an
indication to such characterisation given" so that <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx lithographica</span>
the London specimen would be a nomen nudum if based on this
publication, so asked the ICZN "to use its plenary power to rule that
both the generic and specific names <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">lithographica</span> have been
made available by von Meyer, 1861b."  The issue was decided by the
ICZN in 2011 as Opinion 2283 in favor of making the London specimen the
neotype.  The London specimen was most recently described in
detail by de Beer (1954).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The feather</span>- The feather was
redescribed by Griffiths (1996), who noted it differed from the London
and Berlin specimens in being smaller, broader and more asymmetric. He
proposed that both taphonomic and taxonomic explanations were possible,
and his analysis indicates the feather cannot be definitively referred
to <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>. Benton and Gower (2002) reveal
Walker had written a letter in 1985 also wondering about the
possibility the feather was taxonomically distinct from the skeletons,
though it was never published. The feather was reinterpreted as a
retrix by Foth and Rauhut (2013) and by Kaye et al. (2019) as a
secondary much shorter than <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>'. 
Most recently, Carney et al. (2019; published in detail in 2020)
convincingly argued the feather is an upper major primary covert and
found it was identical in anatomy and size to that of the Altmuhl <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> specimen. 
Unfortunately they dismissed an alternative taxonomic identification by
proposing all Solnhofen paravians are <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>,
whereas this site supports the validity of 'anchiornithine' <span style="font-style: italic;">Ostromia</span> and unenlagiine <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcmonavis</span>.  Yet given the
differences between <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span> feathers, and
that unenlagiines are even more distant phylogenetically, a referral to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ostromia</span> or the larger <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcmonavis</span> is here considered less
likely.<br>
<b>Berlin specimen</b>-
The Berlin specimen was probably discovered in 1875 or 1874
(Tischlinger, 2005), though first announced in May 1877 (Haberlein,
1877) and variously regarded as conspecific with the London specimen
(Dames, 1884), or different due to size (Seeley, 1881). Later, Dames
(1897) made the holotype of a new species- <i>Archaeopteryx siemensii</i>
due to dental and pelvic characters. Subsequently, Petronievics (as a
footnote in Petronievics and Woodward, 1917) separated it further as a
new genus- <i>Archaeornis</i>. This was due to his view the expanded
calcitic mass of the London specimen was not homologous to the pubic
boot of the Berlin specimen, that the latter lacked a pubic symphysis,
and other unstated pectoral and pelvic differences. Additional
differences later provided by Petronievics (1921, 1925) include teeth
with a circular cross section, proximal carpals ossified, metacarpal
III with cylindrical section, unfused scapulocoracoid, narrow coracoid,
unfused tibiotarsus, pubis and ischium at a greater angle, obturator
foramen absent in pubis, straight ischium, and ischium poorly ossified
distally. Petronievics later (1927, 1950) went so far as to place <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
as a pan-paleognath and <i>Archaeornis</i> as a pan-neognath. Nopcsa
(1923) stated most of these characters were preservational (carpal
number; pubic foot size; ischial shape) or ontogenetic (length of pubic
symphysis; ischial ossification; tibiotarsal fusion), while others were
misinterpretations (tooth cross section; scapulocoracoid fusion; pubic
angle; obturator foramen). He and de Beer (1954) synonymized it with <i>A.
lithographica</i>, which has been the consensus until the 2000s. In
2002, Elzanowski reinstated <i>Archaeopteryx siemensii</i> based on
the smaller size, lack of a cuppedicus fossa on the ilium, lack of a
ventral hook on the ilial preacetabular process, and pedal unguals
without flexor tubercles. Senter and Robins (2003) disagreed, finding
flexor tubercles in all <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
specimens, and believing the ilial features to become more developed
with age. Mayr et al. (2007) confirmed the flexor tubercles are more
poorly developed and noted the metatarsus was more slender, but did not
comment on ilial morphology.  Wang et al. (2017) confirmed the
presence of a propatagium.<br>
<b>Maxberg Specimen</b>- The Maxberg specimen was discovered in 1956
and described in 1959 by Heller. It was privately owned by Opitsch,
though on display at the Maxberg Museum from 1959-1982. Unfortunately,
when Opitsch died in 1991, the specimen could not be found and was
seemingly stolen (Abbott, 1992). Mayr et al. (2007) assigned it to <i>A.
lithographica</i> (as opposed to <i>A. siemensii</i>) due to its
robust metatarsus. <br>
<b>Eichstatt specimen</b>- The Eichstatt specimen was recognized in
March 1951 and originally identified as a juvenile <i>Compsognathus</i>.
It was initially described by Mayr (1973) as perhaps a new species of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
and later in detail by Wellnhofer (1974) as a juvenile <i>A.
lithographica</i>. Howgate (1984) separated it from the other specimens
then known as a new species, <i>Archaeopteryx recurva</i>. This was
based on the small size, recurved teeth, supposedly absent furcula,
more vertical pubis, short pubic symphysis, elongate tibia (1.42 times
femoral length compared to 1.30-1.38), elongate metatarsus (1.67 times
femoral length compared to 1.43-1.47) and unfused metatarsus. He later
used these characters to separate it further as a new genus- <i>Jurapteryx</i>.
However, almost all later authors have believed it to be a juvenile
specimen of <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i> (Paul, 1988;
Wellnhofer, 1992), with the furcula missing due to taphonomy and the
pubes of the London and Berlin specimens rotated too far posteriorly.
Houck et al. (1990) determined the limb proportions of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
specimens were consistant with allometric variation that would be
expected due to ontogeny, which has been confirmed for subsequent
specimens by Senter and Robins (2003) and Bennett (2008).
Christiansen's (2006) allometric study concluded the data supported
multiple species at least as well as it did a single species, but his
rationale was flawed (Bennett, 2008). Elzanowski (2002) could not
confirm separation of the Eichstatt specimen as a distinct species,
while Senter and Robins (2003) noted theropods such as <i>Coelophysis</i>
decrease curvature of teeth with ontogeny, suggesting the same
explanation for the Eichstatt specimen's teeth. <br>
<b>Solnhofen specimen</b>- The Solnhofen specimen was recognized as <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> in November 1987 in
Muller's private collection after being initially identified as a <i>Compsognathus</i>
until it was examined by Wellnhofer and described by him in 1988 as a
new specimen of <i>Archaeopteryx lithographica</i>.
Muller claimed it was probably recovered 10-15 years prior to 1987, but
a litigant onvolved in ownership of the fossil claimed it was actually
found in 1985.  Longer descriptions of the material appeared later
in 1988 and in 1992. In 2001, Elzanowski separated the specimen as a
new taxon - <i>Wellnhoferia grandis</i>. This was based on the large
size, short tail as reconstructed (~16-17 vertebrae), unfused
scapulocoracoid, shorter manual ungual I compared to phalanx I-1 (33%),
manual phalanges I-1 and II-2 deeper, manual phalanges III-1 and III-2
sutured, more retroverted pubis (~128 degrees), metatarsals II and IV
subequal in length, pedal phalanx II-2 longer than II-1, short pedal
digit IV with only four phalanges, pedal ungual IV longest phalanx in
digit, and pedal ungual IV straight with flexor tubercle widely
separated from its base. In 2002, he added a proximally tapering
metatarsal II to the diagnosis. Senter and Robins (2003) agree it is
distinct, and Mayr et al. (2007) agree it is distinct from the Berlin
and Munich specimens, but disputed differences between it and the
London specimen (synonymizing it with <i>A. lithographica</i>). In
particular, they note the proportions of manual digit I phalanges and
number of phalanges in pedal digit IV are not preserved in the London
specimen, and the tail length is uncertain in the Solnhofen specimen
(it was estimated to be short by Elzanowski due to the rapid decrease
in central length distally). The specimens are also both larger than
other specimens and share additional characters (premaxillary teeth
with constricted crowns; similar limb proportions; stout metatarsus;
well developed flexor tubercles on pedal unguals). However, the London
specimen has a fused scapulocoracoid, pedal phalanx II-2 equal in
length to II-1, a more elongate pedal digit IV, and a curved pedal
ungual IV. <br>
<b>Munich specimen</b>- The next specimen was discovered on August 3
1992 and first called the Solnhofen-Aktien-Verein specimen, then later
the Munich specimen. It was described in 1993 as a new species of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
<i>A. bavarica</i>. This was based on the small size, twelve dentary
teeth, dentary interdental plates, ossified sternum, elongate tibia
(1.48 times femoral length), hindlimb elongate compared to humerus
(3.56 times). Elzanowski (2002) added further distinguishing
characters- anterior dentary tooth crowns compressed; third and fourth
cervical neural spines tall, equaling about a third of vertebral
height; ulna elongate compared to humerus (96%); ilium lacking ventral
hook on preacetabular process; no cuppedicus fossa on ilium; pedal
unguals lack flexor tubercles. Senter and Robins (2003) determined the
tibial, hindlimb and ulnar lengths were all explainable by allometry,
believed the ilial features could be absent due to ontogeny, noted
tooth compression could be too (as in tyrannosaurids), and stated pedal
ungual flexor tubercles are actually present. Wellnhofer and
Tischlinger (2004) determined the supposed sternum of the Munich
specimen is really a coracoid. Mayr et al. (2007) noted their new
specimen is intermediate between the Munich and Berlin specimens in
size, hindlimb and ulnar proportions, while its tibia is longer than
the Munich specimen. Considering the misidentified sternum, and that
the ilial and pedal ungual characters are supposedly shared with the
Berlin specimen, they synonymized <i>A. bavarica</i> with <i>A.
siemensii</i>. <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Daiting specimen</span>- The eighth or
Daiting specimen was discovered in 1990 and initially identified as a
pterosaur, but not publicized until a cast was displayed in 1996. It
was originally noted by Mauser (1997) in a brief article and was
described by Tischlinger (2009) then in more detail by Kundrát et al.
(2019).  Albersdörfer bought it from a private collector in 2009
and placed it on long term loan to the BSPG as SNSB BSPG
VN-2010/1.  It is the youngest of described specimens, the same
age as <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcmonavis</span>.  Kundrát
et al. (2014) believed fused internasal and interfrontal
contacts and "numerous other cranial features" suggested this could be
a separate species from the Eichstatt and Thermopolis specimens, and
described it as <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx
albersdoerferi</span>
in 2019.  Diagnostic characters listed by Kundrát et al. are-
angle between the nasal process and ventral margin of maxilla &gt;50
degrees; antorbital fenestra and combined maxillary/promaxillary
fenestrae both higher than wide; anterior lacrimal process slightly
longer than posterior process; pneumatic recess present at anterior end
of jugal; incomplete postorbital bar; Y-shaped quadratojugal with
reduced dorsal process and expanded posterior process; quadrate with
incompletely bilobed head, massive lateral vertical rim and enlarged
medial condyle separated from lateral condyle by shallow depression;
maxillary and pterygoid palatine processes of equal length; heterodont
maxillary dentition comprising asymmetrical anterior and symmetrical
posterior crowns; teeth labiolingually compressed; coracoid with
lateral process as long as half of mid-coracoid width; coracoid with
tuber that does not project beyond dorsal margin; deltopectoral portion
of humeral shaft strongly angled (rather then curved) posteriorly;
distal carpal III fused with metacarpal II; semilunate carpal fused
with the metacarpals I and II.  It was recovered as either an
archaeopterygid (Xu et al. 2011 TWiG parsimony analysis; Godefroit et
al. 2011 Cau analysis) or closer to Aves (Xu et al. 2011 TWiG Bayesian
analysis; Turner et al., 2012 TWiG analysis).  <br>
<b>New specimens</b>- The ninth specimen was initially announced by
Roper (2004) after it was collected in Spring of that year. Also known
as the chicken wing or Ottmann and Steil specimen, it has immature bone
grain. Wellnhofer and Roper (2005) described it in detail, assigning it
to <i>A. lithographica</i> instead of <i>A. bavarica</i> (based on
ulnar proportions). <br>
The Thermopolis specimen was found in the estate of a fossil collector
in the 1970s, but not offered to the scientific community until
2001.  It was briefly described in 2005 (Mayr, 2005; Mayr et al.,
2005) before being described in detail by Mayr et al. (2007). Though
initially only assigned to <i>Archaeopteryx sp.</i> (Mayr et al.,
2005), they later assigned it to <i>A. siemensii</i>, in which they
also include the Munich specimen. This was based on small size, slender
metatarsus, poorly developed pedal ungual flexor tubercles, as well as
characters differing from the Solnhofen specimen (long manual ungual I;
metatarsals II and IV not subequal; pedal digit IV with five phalanges;
pedal ungual IV shorter than phalanx IV-1). They further note that the
ischium exhibits a different morphology than the London specimen, which
added evidence to separate <i>siemensii</i> from <i>lithographica</i>.
<br>
An eleventh specimen or Altmuhl specimen was announced at the Munich
Show - Mineralientage München in 2011 (artdaily.cc, online 2011). The
skeleton is essentially complete except for most of the skull and one
pectoral girdle and arm. Foth and Rauhut (2013) describe the feathers
in an abstract, and officially in Foth et al. (2014). Foth et al. only
refer the specimen to <i>Archaeopteryx</i> sp. noting the taxonomic
controversy surrounding the genus.<br>
The twelfth specimen or Schamhaupten specimen was found in Summer of
2010 and described in depth by Rauhut et al. (2018).  It is the
oldest of published specimens, from the earliest Tithonian Painten
Formation, and was referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span>
sp..  It's notable for having obvious postorbitals and prefrontals.<br>
A thirteenth specimen, SNSB-BSPG 2017 I 133 or the Muhlheim specimen,
was found in 2017.  It was described by Rauhut et al. (2019) as a
new taxon of avialan closer to Pygostylia, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alcmonavis poeschli</span>.<br>
<b>Resolving the species problem</b>-
As can be seen from the above discussions, recent papers have placed
the known specimens in one (Paul, 2002), two (Senter and Robins, 2004;
Mayr et al., 2007) or four (Elzanowski, 2002) species, often based on
similar characters. These will be examined below (minus the twelfth
specimen, described after text was written) to determine how many
species are based on good evidence.<br>
Size is not evidence of multiple species, as no specimen is obviously
adult, and young theropods (including basal birds) were precocial in
regard to their ossification timing (e.g. <i>Scipionyx</i>, juvenile
Yixian enantiornithines). The latter disproves Howgate's (1984)
suggestion that well ossified elements indicate the Eichstatt specimen
is an adult. More recently, Erickson et al. (2009) have analyzed the
histology of the Munich specimen and noted this and other specimens
(including the Solnhofen specimen) show fibrous surface texture with
long striae on long bones typical of young individuals. <br>
Tooth recurvature is polymorphic in every specimen (Howgate, 1984). In
the London specimen, the third premaxillary tooth and maxillary teeth
1, 3 and 6 are straight, but an isolated premaxillary tooth is
recurved. In the Berlin specimen, the first premaxillary tooth, and
maxillary teeth 1 and 6 are straight, but premaxillary teeth 2-4 and
maxillary teeth 1 and 3-5 are recurved. In the Eichstatt specimen,
maxillary teeth 3 and 9, and dentary teeth 2, 4-6 and 10-11 are
straight, but all premaxillary teeth, maxillary teeth 1-2 and 4-6, and
dentary tooth 7 are recurved. In the Thermopolis specimen, premaxillary
teeth 1-2 are straight, but premaxillary teeth 3-4 and maxillary teeth
4-8 are recurved. In the Solnhofen specimen, premaxillary teeth 1-2 and
4, maxillary teeth 4-7 and perhaps four dentary teeth (4-7?) are
straight, but premaxillary tooth 3 and maxillary teeth 2 and 3 are
recurved. In the Daiting specimen, three maxillary teeth and two
dentary teeth are straight, while one dentary tooth is recurved. In the
11th specimen, premaxillary teeth 1-2 and most dentary teeth are
straight but premaxillary teeth 3-4 and at least one dentary tooth are
recurved. The narrow tips of the Eichstatt specimen's teeth are
directly due to the more acute angle of a recurved crown, and some of
its teeth (e.g. second premaxillary tooth) have apical wear facets as
in the London specimen. The London's and Munich's specimens teeth
appear flatter because they are exposed in lingual view, unlike the
Berlin specimen. The presence of one less dentary tooth in the Munich
specimen compared to the Eichstatt specimen is within the normal range
of interspecific variation in theropods (e.g. Currie, 2003). The
presence of interdental plates in the Munich specimen is probably a
misinterpretation (Martin and Stewart, 1999), so it it similar to the
London and 11th specimens in this regard. So the only difference is in
the frequency of tooth recurvature, which is actually less in the
Eichstatt specimen than the Berlin and Thermopolis specimens, while the
sample size of the London specimen (four teeth) is too low for useful
comparison. A large sample of <i>Saurornitholestes</i> teeth shows
generally decreasing curvature with increasing size, which shows
curvature could be ontogenetic as described by Howgate (1984) for <i>Varanus</i>
and Senter and Robins (2004) for <i>Coelophysis</i>. There are a
number of cranial differences between the Berlin and Eichstatt
specimens which may be due to ontogeny (the Berlin specimen has a more
convex ventral maxillary edge, differently sized and placed maxillary
fenestrae, deeper dentary; similar to ontogenetic changes in
tyrannosaurids), though if the subnarial nasal process being absent
isn't preservational, it may be of taxonomic importance. The convexity
doesn't seem to be shared by the Solnhofen or Thermopolis specimens.
The Thermopolis specimen has a nasal subnarial process and maxillary
fenestrae that resemble the Eichstatt specimen's more, but the latter
are still differently shaped. <br>
The neural spines of cervical vertebrae three and four are comparable
in height in the Eichstatt (3rd 28% of vertebral height; 4th 28%),
Berlin (3rd 29%; 4th 28%) and Munich (3rd 29%; 4th 30%) specimens.
While it's true the tail of the Solnhofen specimen is broken through
the fifteenth caudal, and thus the total number of vertebrae is
uncertain, Elzanowski (2001) based his lower estimate on the sharp
decrease in centrum length between the thirteenth and fourteenth caudal
(the latter is 73% of the former). This compares to 95% in the London
specimen, 92% in the Munich specimen, ~91% in the Berlin specimen, 100%
in the Eichstatt specimen, 97% in the Thermopolis specimen and ~97% in
the 11th specimen. Contrary to Elzanowski though, the fifteenth caudal
is not necessarily as short, since only the proximal half is preserved.
Other <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens can have isolated shorter
vertebrae before the tail tip, for instance caudal 17 of the Munich
specimen is 74% as long as caudal 16, even though caudals 18 and 19 are
88% and 105% as long as caudal 16. While Elzanowski argues the sudden
thinness of these last two vertebrae shows they were near the tail tip,
Wellnhofer (1992) notes the tail is twisted at caudals 12-13 to show
the following vertebrae in dorsal aspect. As in the Thermopolis
specimen, distal caudal vertebrae are taller than they are wide,
explaining the thinness. Thus the tail of the Solnhofen specimen was
not necessarily shorter than the others'. One vertebral difference in
specimens that does seem real is the height of the dorsal neural
spines, which using the twelfth dorsal vertebra for comparison are 28%
of vertebral height in the Eichstatt specimen, 26% in the Solnhofen
specimen, 38% in the Munich specimen, ~29% in the Berlin specimen, ~29%
in the Maxberg specimen and ~38% in the 11th specimen. Also, the
Thermopolis specimen has its last dorsal sutured to the sacrum, giving
it six sacral vertebrae. This is certainly not the case for the
Eichstatt, Maxberg and London specimens, and doesn't seem to be for the
Munich specimen either. The Eichstatt specimen seems to lack caudal
neural spines, wheras they are present in the Munich, Solnhofen and
11th specimens. <br>
The scapula and coracoid are apparently fused in the London specimen,
tightly connected in the Berlin and Maxberg specimens, and more loosely
connected in the Eichstatt, Solnhofen, Daiting and 11th specimens. They
are also unfused in the Munich and Thermopolis specimens. However,
scapulocoracoid fusion is variable within other taxa as well, including
<i>Struthiomimus</i>, <i>Dromiceiomimus</i> and <i>Caudipteryx</i>.
Maniraptoran coracoids are complex bones, which makes comparing their
shapes difficult. For instance, the right coracoid of the Thermopolis
specimen and left coracoid of the London specimen (as illustrated by
Ostrom, 1976) appear to be short, but that's probably because their
proximal portion is bent into the sediment. The proximal portion is
illustrated in the London specimen by Petronievics and Woodward (1917),
and also makes the coracoid elongate in the Munich specimen, while the
bend can be observed in the lateral views of the Solnhofen and
Thermopolis left coracoids. The medial margin of the London specimen's
coracoid has two notches which are not seen in the Munich or
Thermopolis specimens. The absence of a furcula in the Eichstatt
specimen is near certainly taphonomic, while the supposed sternum in
the Munich specimen is a coracoid.<br>
Ulnohumeral ratios vary between ~86% (Maxberg), 87% (Berlin), ~87%
(Solnhofen), 88% (Eichstatt and ninth), 89% (Thermopolis), 90%
(London), ~92% (Daiting), ~95% (11th) and ~96% (Munich). While this a
large amount of variation, is is continuous and also known in <i>Sapeornis</i>.
All specimens probably had four carpals (scapholunare, pisiform,
semilunate carpal, distal carpal III), though these are easily lost. In
particular, the London specimen is seemingly missing proximal carpals,
the Eichstatt specimen lacks the pisiform on the right hand (the bone
labeled as an ulnare is probably distal carpal III), the left manus of
the Munich specimen lacks the scapholunare, only the semilunates are
visible in the Thermopolis specimen, ninth and Daiting specimens, and
the Maxberg specimen seems to lack preserved carpals. Contrary to
Elzanowski (2001), manual ungual I is not short compared to phalanx I-1
in the Solnhofen specimen. However, manual phalanx I-1 of the Solnhofen
specimen is 1.39 times as long as phalanx II-1, compared to 1.36 times
in the ninth specimen, 1.60 times in the Munich specimen, 1.32 times in
the Berlin specimen, 1.53 times in the Eichstatt specimen, 1.52 times
in the Thermopolis specimen and 1.25 times in the 11th specimen.
Similar variation is known in other coelurosaurs however (<i>Sapeornis</i>,
<i>Dromiceiomimus</i>, <i>Gorgosaurus</i>). Elzanowski (2001) noted
manual phalanx I-1 is more robust in the Solnhofen and Haarlem
specimens (minimum height 8.4% and 8.2% of phalanx length respectively
compared to the Berlin (6%), Eichstatt (5.84%) and Munich (5.75%)
specimens, and this is also true compared to the ninth (6.56%),
Thermopolis (7.4%) and 11th (7.0%) specimens. Yet the latter three also
close the gap in ratios, making them seem less important for dividing
specimens. Similarly, the Thermopolis specimen (~8.1%) fills the gap
between the Solnhofen (8.9%) and 11th (8.7%) on one hand, and the
Berlin (6.2%), Eichstatt (6.9%) and Berlin (6.2%) specimens on the
other when it comes to robusticity of manual phalanx II-2. The cross
section of metacarpal III was said to distinguish the London and Berlin
specimens, but this has not been studied in further specimens.
Metacarpal III is more bowed with an intermetacarpal gap in the
Solnhofen, Munich, Thermopolis and ninth specimens compared to the
Berlin, Eichstatt, Daiting and 11th specimens, but this may be due to
its orientation. Manual phalanges III-1 and III-2 are sutured in the
Solnhofen specimen (as in <i>Jinfengopteryx</i> and the <i>Didactylornis</i>
type), but not in the Berlin, Maxberg, Eichstatt, Munich, ninth and
Thermopolis specimens. The ratio between phalanges III-2 and III-1
varies between 66% (Berlin), ~69% (Maxberg), 71% (Eichstatt), 79%
(ninth), 81% (Solnhofen), 83% (11th), 86% (Munich) and 88%
(Thermopolis). While this is quite a range, it is also gradational and
seen in some other taxa (<i>Struthiomimus</i>, <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>).
<br>
The Eichstatt, Solnhofen, Berlin and possibly the 11th specimens have
an unexpanded preacetabular processes, the London and probably the
Munich and Thermopolis specimens have ventrally expanded processes.
Senter and Robins (2003) suggested this could be due to ontogeny, but
juvenile tyrannosaurids, <i>Juravenator</i>, <i>Gallimimus</i>,
therizinosauroids, <i>Microvenator</i>, <i>Bambiraptor</i> and <i>Scansoriopteryx</i>
all have expanded preacetabular processes, though the subadult <i>Yangchuanosaurus
shangyouensis</i> holotype lacks one while the larger <i>Y. magnus</i>
holotype has one. The preacetabular process varies in length between
specimens, from 54% of pubic peduncle plus acetabulum length in the
Solnhofen specimen to 89% (Eichstatt), ~111% (Munich), 120% (London),
~133% (11th) and 160% (Berlin). Elzanowski (2002) claimed the Berlin
and Munich specimens lack an m. cuppedicus fossa on their ilia, unlike
the London specimen, but such a fossa is clearly visible in the Berlin
specimen (Ostrom, 1976- figure 20) while the Munich specimen seems to
not preserve a lateral surface (Wellnhofer, 1993- plate 9). The
Eichstatt specimen's ilium is only visible in medial view, while the
Solnhofen specimen is too poorly preserved to tell. The London specimen
differs from the Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich and Solnhofen specimens in
having a dorsally concave ilium. The pubic angle of <i>Archaeopteryx</i>
has been quite controversial, but is articulated at 3 degrees posterior
to vertical in the Munich specimen. The pubis is disarticulated in the
London, Berlin, Eichstatt, Solnhofen, Thermopolis and 11th specimens,
so its angle cannot be used to distinguish species. The London and
Thermopolis specimens have posterior pubic boots partially replaced by
calcite (originally from cartilage?), while the Eichstatt, Munich,
Berlin and 11th specimens seem to have more ossified pubic boots, but
this could be ontogenetic. The London specimen differs from the
Haarlem, Berlin and Eichstatt specimens (Ostrom, 1976) in having a
transversely expanded pubic boot. The length of the pubic apron varies
between 36% (Berlin), 39% (Solnhofen), 40% (Eichstatt), ~46% (London)
and ~47% (Thermopolis), but may be overestimated in the last two due to
their incompletely ossified distal ends. The obturator foramen
identified by Petronievics in the London specimen is a pneumatic fossa
(Christiansen and Bonde, 2000), and whether it is present in other
specimens is uncertain due to a lack of posterior pubic exposure. The
ischia of specimens differ a great deal, but this has not been recently
and explicitly described. The London specimen has an obturator foramen
(unique among maniraptoriforms), while a fossa is present in the
Eichstatt and Munich specimen, and the Thermopolis and 11th specimens
seemingly lack either. The proximoventral edge of the ischium is convex
in the London specimen, unlike the Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich,
Thermopolis and 11th specimens. The obturator process projects
ventrally in the Munich and Thermopolis specimens, a bit less in the
Eichstatt and 11th specimens, and not at all in the London specimen.
The distodorsal process (at midlength) varies from a rounded bump in
the London specimen and low angularity in the Munich specimen to a
large triangular spine in the Solnhofen, 11th and especially Eichstatt
specimens, to a large flange with a posterior notch in the Thermopolis
specimen. Similarly, the proximodorsal process varies from a low peak
(Berlin, Eichstatt, Thermopolis, 11th), to a slender point (Solnhofen),
to a massive block-like process (Munich, London). The London specimen's
further differs in having a notch proximally, making it rectangular.
Ischial variation has not been examined much in other taxa, though <i>Microraptor</i>
varies in the angle of the distal obturator process edge, obturator
process expansion, shaft depth and ventral convexity proximal to the
obturator process. <i>Mirischia</i> famously varies in the presence of
an obturator process and notch. <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> varies in
obturator process size and orientation, as well as proximodorsal
process size, shaft curvature and distal expansion. The differences
observed in <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens may be due to intraspecific
variation as well.<br>
Hindlimb ratios are explainable by allometry (Bennett, 2008), as are
the more robust metatarsi of large specimens (Maxberg, Solnhofen)
compared to smaller ones (Eichstatt, Munich, Thermopolis, 11th)
(compare to juvenile tyrannosaurids vs. adults). Tibiotarsal and
tarsometatarsal fusion is controversial in <i>Archaeopteryx</i>. It
seems absent in the Eichstatt and Munich specimens. Tibiotarsal and
metatarsal fusion are absent in the Thermopolis specimen, though the
astragalus and calcaneum could be fused. In the Berlin and London
specimens, there is no evidence for metatarsal fusion and at least the
ascending process of the astragalus remains unfused to the tibia.
Though Ostrom (1976) claimed the distal tarsal in the Maxberg specimen
was "at least partially fused" to the metatarsus, he said the same of
the Eichstatt specimen which seems to be untrue. Metatarsals II-IV of
the Maxberg specimen are indistinguishable proximally and fused as
determined by x-rays. The Solnhofen specimen lacks tibiotarsal and
tarsometatarsal fusion, but metatarsals II-IV seem to be partially
fused proximally. Fusion could be ontogenetic, of course, as the
Solnhofen and Maxberg are among the largest specimens. The metatarsal
II/IV ratio varies between 97% (Thermopolis), ~97% (Munich, Maxberg,
11th), 100% (Solnhofen), 104% (Eichstatt), and ~108% (Berlin). <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
has a similar variation (91-103%), and that of <i>Dromiceiomimus</i>
is slightly less (90-97%). While Elzanowski (2001) emphasized the equal
lengths in the Solnhofen specimen, it is intermediate between the other
specimens and thus not an outlier. The proximally tapering second
metatarsal in the right foot of the Solnhofen specimen is probably due
to distortion as it is not present in the left foot. The phalanx
II-2/II-1 ratio varies between 83% (Thermopolis), 85% (Berlin), 96-98%
(11th), ~99% (Eichstatt), ~100% (Munich), 100% (London), 104%
(Solnhofen) and ~105% (Maxberg), so would seem to distinguish the
Berlin+Thermopolis specimens, as opposed to the Solnhofen specimen
(contra Elzanowski, 2001). Ratios in <i>Velociraptor</i> are more
variable (103-129%), showing this could be intraspecific variation.
Pedal digit IV has four phalanges in the Solnhofen specimen (as in the <i>Didactylornis</i>
type), but five phalanges in the Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich, Thermopolis
and 11th specimens. This leads to the fourth digit being shorter in the
Solnhofen specimen. Though the London specimen has an unknown number of
phalanges in digit IV, it is long as in specimens with five phalanges.
Pedal ungual IV is longer than phalanx IV-1 in the Solnhofen specimen,
but not the Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich and Thermopolis specimens. Pedal
ungual IV of the Solnhofen specimen is also distinct from the London,
Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich, Thermopolis and 11th specimens in being
straight ventrally. Variation in pedal ungual curvature has been
reported in <i>Deinonychus</i> too (Ostrom, 1969). Pedal flexor
tubercles are large in the London (I, II, III and IV) and Solnhofen (I
and III but not IV) specimens, but small (though not absent) in the
Berlin, Eichstatt, Munich, Thermopolis and 11th specimens. If <i>Zhongornis</i>
is a juvenile <i>Confuciusornis</i>, it would provide an example of
young specimens having smaller pedal flexor tubercles than adults.<br>
When the characters above are entered into a matrix with <i>Shenzhouraptor</i>
and <i>Anchiornis</i> as outgroups to establish polarity, the
London+Munich specimens branch off first due to preacetabular length
(also in the 11th), obturator area of ischium at least depressed (also
in Eichstatt) and large proximodorsal ischial process. Other specimens
are united with <i>Shenzhouraptor</i> by the low dorsal neural spines
(not in the 11th specimen) and large distodorsal ischial process. The
Berlin, Eichstatt, Thermopolis and 11th specimens are united by
non-enlarged pedal flexor tubercles (also in Munich), while the
Maxburg, Solnhofen and <i>Shenzhouraptor</i> are united by metatarsal
fusion. The Solnhofen, ninth and <i>Shenzhouraptor</i> are united by a
short manual phalanx I-1 (also in the Berlin specimen and some <i>Anchiornis</i>)
and pedal ungual IV longer than IV-1 (also in some <i>Anchiornis</i>).
The fact most of these characters are homoplasious shows that there is
little evidence to subdivide the genus into species containing more
than one individual, despite individual <i>Archaeopteryx</i> specimens
(particularily the London and Solnhofen specimens) having several
unique features. The choices are similar to that entertained for <i>Microraptor</i>
on this site, either several species each represented by a single
specimen, or one species which is variable in morphology. The latter
more conservative approach is taken here, especially considering the
fact no specimens are adult.  Additional evidence is provided by
the maniraptoromorph matrix of Hartman et al. 2019 where a topology of
((7(11(2,5)))(12((1,10)(6,8)))) is recovered, incompatable with any
suggested distribution of taxa.<br>

is an unenlagiid as recovered by Hartman et al..  However, it self

where <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> is closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>.  This and the

sister to Pennaraptora (which left <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>
more basal), and three steps were needed to make it a therizinosaur
(where it remains sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>),
oviraptorosaur or within Eumaniraptora (as either an archaeopterygid or
dromaeosaurid).  In Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix, <span style="font-style: italic;">Migmanychion</span>
resolves as a paravian either sister to other dromaeosaurids or
anywhere in Halszkaraptorinae.  One step can make it an
archaeopterygid or unenlagiine, while two steps can make it a
troodontid, basalmost deinonychosaur, basalmost avialan, basalmost
oviraptorosaur, sister to Pennaraptora, sister to
Therizinosauria+Alvarezsauroidea, basalmost maniraptoran, basalmost
ornithomimosaur, sister to Maniraptoriformes or sister to
Ornitholestiinae (which includes <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>,
although making it sister to that genus takes three steps).  Thus
its fragmentary preservation and unspecialized morphology make <span style="font-style: italic;">Migmanychion</span>
plausibly fit many places between ornitholestiids and Euavialae,
although generally not within the known content of each subclade. 
Notably the basal deinonychosaur position preferred here makes referral
of additional Pigeon Hill specimens LY 2022JZ3004 (pelvic area referred
to Paraves by Wang et al.) and LY 2022JZ3005 (subarctometatarsal

Seeley, 1887<br>
<i><b>O. cluniculus</b></i> Seeley, 1887<br>
<b>Barremian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Wessex Formation, England</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R187) (sacrum- 96 mm) first sacral vertebra (17
mm), second sacral vertebra (16 mm), third sacral vertebra (18 mm),
fourth sacral vertebra (15 mm), fifth sacral vertebra (16 mm), sixth
sacral vertebra (13 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was purchased from the Fox collection in
1884 (Lydekker, 1888).  Seeley (1887) originally described <i>Ornithodesmus</i>
as a bird, but Hulke (in Anonymous, 1887) soon suggested it was
pterosaurian. Seeley later (1901) referred pterosaur skeleton NHMUK
R176 to <i>Ornithodesmus</i> as a new species, <i>O. latidens</i>.
For over a century, the well known pterosaur <i>Ornithodesmus latidens</i>
was used as the standard example of the genus. This ended in 1993 when
Howse and Milner reidentified the <i>Ornithodesmus cluniculus</i>
holotype as a theropod (the pterosaur was later renamed <i>Istiodactylus
latidens</i> by Howse et al., 2001). Specifically they believed it to
be a troodontid, based largely on comparison to NHMUK R4463 (another
supposed troodontid sacrum). Makovicky (1995) and Norell and Makovicky
(1997) identified NHMUK R4463 as <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, and the
latter reference noted <i>Ornithodesmus</i> resembles Dromaeosauridae
in possessing a well developed dorsal ridge formed by zygapophyses.
Makovicky stated the specimen was "probably neither a troodontid nor a
dromaeosaurid" while Naish et al. (2001) stated some characters argue
against a dromaeosaurid identity, such as transverse processes which
are not dorsoventrally flattened. That character is meaningless outside
of a phylogenetic context however. As an alternative, Naish et al. note
resemblence to <i>Coelophysis rhodesiensis</i> and <i>Carnotaurus</i>
in the presence of six sacrals, neural spine lamina and neural
platform. Yet coelophysoids never have more than five sacrals, and
dromaeosaurids like <i>Velociraptor</i> have all three listed
characters. In addition, no coelophysoids or ceratosaurs have sacral
pleurocoels or flattened ventral sacral surfaces with a median groove,
unlike <i>Ornithodesmus</i>
and dromaeosaurids.  It was first included in the maniraptoromorph
analysis of Hartman et al. (2019) who recovered it in Unenlagiinae, but
after the addition of more data it can also fall out in
Halszkaraptorinae or as a basal dromaeosaurid with an equal number of
steps.  <br>

brachialis fossa on the ulna is due to crushing. The other characters
listed in Allain and Taquet's (2000) diagnosis are common in
dromaeosaurids- teeth distally serrated and with restricted mesial
serrations; ulna subequal in lenth to metatarsus; asymmetrically
ginglymoid metatarsal II; strongly curved pedal ungual II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The hypodigm was discovered from 1993-1998.  At
least two individuals are present in the type material, based on a
larger second pedal phalanx II-2 (Turner et al., 2012). Turner et al.
also noted a metatarsal III is present in the collection, and Allain
and Taquet misidentified metatarsal I as a distal metacarpal I.
DPM-MON-T1 was first described as Dromaeosauridae indet. 3 by Torices
(2002). Torices et al. (2015) identified several teeth and dentary
fragments based on morphometric analysis, plus spatiotemporal
similarity.<br>
<i>Pyroraptor</i> may be a junior synonym of the contemporary
dromaeosaurid <i>Variraptor</i>, but this cannot be established until
the dorsal vertebra MNHN BO017 or additional specimens are described.
Alternatively, the paratypes and referred specimens of <i>Variraptor</i>
may belong to <i>Pyroraptor</i> instead. They are not comparable
presently.<br>
Senter et al. (2004) included <i>Pyroraptor</i> in their phylogenetic
analysis of coelurosaurs and found it to be a dromaeosaurid excluded
from Microraptoria (based on the stout pedal phalanx II-2) and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>+<i>Utahraptor</i>
(based on the high DSDI). Turner et al. found it to fall within
Dromaeosauridae, but outside Eudromaeosauria (including <i>Bambiraptor</i>
in their trees).  Hartman et al. (2019) recovered it as an
unenlagiine, but with the addition of more data it can equally
parsimoniously be a microraptorian dromaeosaurid.  <br>

also included frontal-orbit contact and the unrestricted supratemporal

typical of theropods.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This specimen was found in 1923 and originally
considered to perhaps be referrable to <i>Vectisaurus</i> (Watson,
1930; Swinton, 1936), though Watson also noted resemblence to <span style="font-style: italic;">Stegoceras</span> (his <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>). Galton (1971) named the
taxon <i>Yaverlandia bitholus</i>, and assigned it to the
Pachycephalosauridae, which was followed by most authors until
recently. When entered into cladistic analyses of Pachycephalosauria, <i>Yaverlandia</i>
was resolved at the base of the clade (Williamson and Carr, 2002) or as
a basal pachycephalosaurid (Sereno, 2000). However, Hopson (1979) and
Giffin (1989) doubted a pachycephalosaurian identity, based on the
structure of the endocranium. Sullivan (2000, 2003) noted several
characters incongruent with a pachycephalosaurian identity- frontals
with broad orbital contact; parietals excluded from domes;
supratemporal fenestrae contact frontals. Naish (2004) determined <i>Yaverlandia</i>
is not a pachycephalosaur, though its identity remained elusive in his
abstract. Naish (2006) noted the taxon shares a few characters with
pachycephalosaurids but lacks pachycephalosaurian and marginocephalian
characters, suggesting either significant reversals or
convergence.  He
classified the genus as a maniraptoriform based on ventrally extending,
laterally concave ridges that form the lateral margins of the cerebral
concavity and ventrally concave dorsal orbital margins, and furthermore
as a troodontid.  Yet most of the troodontid-like characters are
also present in unenlagiines and <span style="font-style: italic;">Halszkaraptor</span>,
neither considered by Naish, so <span style="font-style: italic;">Yaverlandia</span>
is here assigned to Ornithodesmiformes instead.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The first troodontids discovered were assigned to the
Megalosauridae (<span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>
in Osborn, 1924) and Coeluridae (<span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>
in Sternberg 1932), both waste-basket families at the time. 
Troodontidae was proposed for pachycephalosaurs by Gilmore (1924) who
believed <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> to be a <span style="font-style: italic;">Stegoceras</span> tooth, until Sternberg
(1945) named Pachycephalosauridae and moved <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> back to Theropoda. 
Barsbold's (1974) Saurornithoididae was used for a time until Currie
(1987) synonymized <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>, with
Troodontidae being used ever since.<br>
Two main alternatives have been proposed for the placement of
troodontids within Theropoda, with Ostrom (1969), Barsbold (1976) and
Gauthier (1984) combining them with dromaeosaurids in Deinonychosauria
based largely on the shared hyperextendable and enlarged pedal ungual
II, while Thulborn (1984), Currie (1985), Bakker (1986) and Holtz
(1992) placed them closer to ornithomimids in Bullatosauria based
largely on the shared inflated parasphenoid cultriform process. 
While this was controversial throughout the 1990s, the description of
basal bird-like <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinovenator</span>
in 2002 cemented maniraptoran and paravian troodontids, with Senter et
al. (2004) probably the last quantitative analysis to support
Bullatosauria (and only because <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinovenator</span>
as drawn away from other troodontids into Dromaeosauridae).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Troodontidae defined</span>- Sereno's
newest (online 2005) definition differs from his earlier (1998) one
which only had <i>Velociraptor</i> as an external specifier, and
Senter et al.'s (2004), which had <i>Mononykus</i>, <i>Therizinosaurus</i>
and <i>Oviraptor</i> as additional external specifiers. Keeping <i>Oviraptor</i>
seems useful, in the case Osmólska and Barsbold (1990), Russell and
Dong (1994) or Norell et al. (2001) are correct. I'm not aware of any
topology placing <i>Shuvuuia</i> or <i>Therizinosaurus</i> closer to <i>Troodon</i>
than the other taxa, but they both seem relatively plausible as
troodontid sister taxa. Hartman et al. (2019) found topologies pairing
troodontids with archaeopterygids were only a single step longer than
grouping troodontids with dromaeosaurids, so added <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeopteryx</span> as an external
specifier so that Archaeopterygidae could not be a senior synonym of
Troodontidae.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Troodontoidea</span>- Livezey and Zusi

"Troodontoidea (<span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>)",
which while possibly a typo (as no other troodontid OTUs were used) is
also among many higher-level taxa stated as new that are used in this
work (e.g. Palaeoaves, Rahoinaviformes, Rahonavidae, Apsaraviformes,
Apsaravidae...).  Bhullar et al. (2012) use Troodontoidea in their
cladogram without comment.  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Microtroodontidae</span>- Wiemann et
al. (2018) use the term microtroodontid without elaboration, first
stating "Egg colour pigments are preserved in eggshells from the
oviraptorid <span style="font-style: italic;">Heyuannia huangi</span>,
Mongolian microtroodontids..." and indicating in Supplementary Table 2
that the two specimens considered microtroodontids are IGM 100/1323
(later made the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>)
and MAE 14-20, which has never been mentioned outside of Wiemann's
eggshell dataset but is stated to also be from the Djadochkta
Formation.   Shown as a clade exclusive of other troodontids
(a Two Medicine <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> egg,
two Djadokhta eggs and PFMM-0014003517 from the <span>Chichengshan
Formation and also not mentioned outside Wiemann's datasets), this is
said to be "a composite topology (supertree) from previously published
phylogenies" 8, 31 and 32, but none of the three references include MAE
14-20.  The term "microtroodontid" is later used in Norell et al.
(2020; supplementary info) and Jiang et al. (2023), but with no further
elaboration.  A</span>ccording to ICZN Article 11.7.11 a
family-group name must be "formed from the stem of an available generic
name" which "must be a name then used as valid in the new family-group
taxon." As Wiemann et al. did not intend for a genus 'Microtroodon' to
be a microtroodontid, it is invalid.  It also fails ICZN Article
13.1.1 ("be accompanied by a description or definition that states in
words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon"), 16.1
("Every new name published after 1999, including new replacement names
(nomina nova), must be explicitly indicated as intentionally new") and
16.2 (" a new family-group name published after 1999 must be
accompanied by citation of the name of the type genus (i.e. the name
from which the family-group name is formed)").<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Macrotroodontidae</span>- Wiemann et
al. (2018) also use the term macrotroodontid without explanation,
stating "Both egg colour pigments were detected in eggshells from <span style="font-style: italic;">H. huangi</span>,
the Mongolian microtroodontid (IGM 100/1323) and macrotroodontid (AMNH
FARB 6631)", which seems to be what they call "Large Troodontid" in
Supplementary Table 2 and includes Two Medicine <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> egg YPM PU 23259, two
Djadokhta eggs (AMNH 6631 and IGM 100/1003; perhaps <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobivenator</span> and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Byronosaurus</span>) and PFMM-0014003517
from the <span>Chichengshan
Formation.  Unlike 'microtroodontid', the term was not used in
subsequent papers, but it is invalid due to the same ICZN Articles
(11.7.11, 13.1.1, 16.1 and 16.2).</span><br>
<b>No longer troodontids</b>-
Note that in cases where specimens consist only of teeth, these are
only referred to Troodontidae here if they match those morphologies
found with known troodontid skulls (roots constricted and carinae
either unserrated, serrated only distally, or with large serrations
present on both carinae).  Teeth with both carinae finely serrated
are known in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornithoides</span>,
but this early taxon can easily move to other positions within Paraves
(Dromaeosauridae, Archaeopterygidae, basal Avialae).  Thus many
teeth with finely serrated mesial and distal carinae and constricted
bases are reassigned to Paraves here, often resembling some <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span>
teeth most, but probably members of poorly known paravian clades in
most cases considering their temporal and geographic position. 
That being said, some posterior teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Caihong</span>
would also fall under the serrated troodontid morphospace, so some
teeth listed as troodontids below may end up being e.g. dromaeosaurids
or archaeopterygids.<br>
Currie et al. (1990) said that troodontid teeth reported from the Cedar
Mountain Formation by Nelson and Crooks (1987) were more likely
velociraptorines because of the serrations are small (12/mm) and
elongate. <br>
Supposed troodontid teeth from the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar
Mountain Formation first noted by Parrish and Eaton (1991) and
described by Frederickson et al. (2018) are here identified as
microraptorian instead.<br>
Bertini and
Franco-Rosas (2001) state "Troodontidae teeth were recognized" among
over 200 specimens from the Late Cretaceous Adamantina and Marilia
Formations of the Bauru Group in Brazil, probably originating with
Bertini's (1993) and
Franco's (1999) theses.  In publications which describe supposedly
troodontid-like teeth from these formations, they are not
distinguishable from e.g. noasaurids which are more geographically
plausible.  Thus they are referred to Averostra here.<br>
Eaton (1999) reported troodontid teeth from the Iron Springs Formation
of Utah, but these were not present in the final report of Eaton et al.
(2014) and may have been based on dromaeosaurid tooth UMNH VP 24114 or
Theropod indet. tooth UMNH VP 24116.<br>
Kirkland et al.
(1998) listed Troodontidae indet. from the basal Straight Cliffs
Formation and the Straight Cliffs Formation, while Eaton et al. (1999)
lists Troodontidae indet. from the Smoky Hollow Member (but not the
John Henry Member) of the Straight Cliffs Formation.  However,
Parrish
(1999) doesn't record any troodontid specimens from either member in
his study, suggesting they were misidentified.<br>
Although Metcalf and Walker (1994) identified a tooth from the
Bathonian Chipping Norton Formation of England as a possible
troodontid, it is more likely a dromaeosaurid. <br>
Nessov (1995) cited a troodontid astragalocalcaneum from the Bostobe
Formation of Kazakhstan, but Averianov and Sues (2007) noted many other
maniraptorans have fused astragalocalcanea as well. Kordokova et al.
(1996) cited troodontids from the Zhirkindek and Bostobe Formations of
Kazakhstan, but these were not mentioned in their later (2001) paper.
Averianov (2007) could not confirm the presence of troodontids from
either formation, but described a frontal as Troodontidae indet. in
2016..<br>
Nessov (1995) identified CCMGE 484/12457 as a troodontid frontal, which
he named <i>Saurornithoides isfarensis</i>. Though they could not
locate it, Averianov and Sues (2007) reidentified the specimen as a
hadrosaurid prefrontal. <br>
Dong (1997) described tooth IVPP V11122-2 from the Zhonggou Formation
of China as Troodontidae, but it is here placed in Deinonychosauria.<br>
Csiki and Grigorescu (1998) described five teeth from the Hateg
Formation of Romania (FGGUB R.1318, R.1319, R.1320 and MAFI v.12685a
and b) as "troodontid-like", more precisely "probably more closely
related to troodontids (?and "paronychodons") than to other small
theropods."  However these more closely resemble the then-unknown <span style="font-style: italic;">Microraptor</span> and are here assigned
to  Deinonychosauria.<br>
Codrea et al. (2002) described teeth as troodontid-like from the
Sinpetru Beds of Romania (IRSNB coll.), but these are referred here to
Averostra.<br>
Debeljak et al. (2002) described a tooth from the Late Cretaceous of
Slovenia (ACKK-D-8/088) as ?troodontid, but it is here referred to
Deinonychosauria.<br>
Codrea et al. (2012) described tooth UBB NgTh1 from the Rusca Mountain
Basin of Romania as being troodontid-like, but it is here placed as
?Averostra.<br>
Ford (online 2015) placed tooth B of Huene (1934; CA coll.) in
Troodontidae without rationale, but it is a narrow D-shape unlike
members of that clade and is placed as Averostra indet. here
following Soto and Cambiaso (2006).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- serrations absent from teeth.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This genus is here restricted to 'paronychodontid'
teeth without serrations mesially or distally, following Currie et al.
(1990). Estes (1964) included serrated specimens with ridges and
flattened lingual sides in the genus as well, though these are here
referred to <i>Zapsalis abradens</i> (= <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span> spp. and ?<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
morphotype A of Sankey et al., 2002) and the unnamed troodontid of
Sankey et al. (2002). Many unstudied specimens catalogued or listed as <i>Paronychodon</i>
probably belong to these two taxa. For instance, one photographed tooth
of AMNH 27122 has distal serrations in addition to ridges, so is
probably a <i>Zapsalis</i> specimen. Teeth matching the <i>Paronychodon</i>
morphotype are known from the Barremian-Maastrichtian of North America
and Eurasia, indicating it was probably a clade comparable to theropod
families in scope, but which didn't show much dental variation. Once
cranial and/or postcranial remains are identified, additional genera of
'paronychodontids' will probably need to be named.<br>
<b>Relationships</b>- <i>Paronychodon</i> was first compared to
plesiosaurs by Cope (1876a), who soon (1876b) realized it was theropod
based on comparison to <i>Zapsalis</i>. Most authors retain the genus
as Theropoda incertae sedis, though some have tried to clarify its
relationships further. Estes (1964) referred it to Coeluridae, while
Russell (1984) referred it to Dromaeosauridae, and Osmólska and
Barsbold (1990) to Troodontidae. These assignments were all done
without justification. <br>
More recently, Zinke and Rauhut (1994) suggested a sister group
relationship to troodontids based on the large apically angled distal
serrations of the Guimarota 'paronychodontid' teeth and the basal
constriction in some teeth. These characters are now known in basal
dromaeosaurids too (e.g. <i>Microraptor</i>). Rauhut and Zinke (1995)
suggested assigning Una Formation <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth to <i>Pelecanimimus</i>,
but Rauhut later (2002) considered this unlikely after communication
with Perez-Moreno. <br>
Rauhut suggested instead that at least the Una <i>Paronychodon</i>
could be archaeopterygids, based on the constricted base, lingually
bent carinae (forming mesial and distal grooves along the carinae
lingually), and labiodistally twisted tips. Yet the last two characters
have yet to be reported from Late Cretaceous <i>Paronychodon</i>,
which differs from the Una specimens in several details in any case. <br>
Another hypothesis was given in an abstract by Sankey (2002), who
purported to show that <i>Paronychodon</i> is a morphotype of <i>Richardoestesia?
isosceles</i>, based on morphology and relative abundance. The details
of this study have yet to be published, though it does make sense
stratigraphically, as both taxa first appear in Late Jurassic Europe
and spread to North America in the Albian, with Late Cretaceous
examples known from the Western North America, Central Asia and Europe.
It's also logical anatomically, as <i>Richardoestesia? isosceles</i>
would be expected to have some unserrated and possibly constricted
teeth if it were microraptorian. It should be noted <i>Paronychodon</i>
has priority over <i>Richardoestesia</i>, and <i>lacustris</i> and <i>caperatus</i>
both have priority over <i>isosceles</i>. Also, <i>Euronychodon</i>
has priority over <i>Asiamericana</i>, and <i>portuculensis</i> has
priority over both <i>asiatica</i> and <i>asiaticus</i>. So if this
synonymy is proven, none of the names associated with straight-toothed <i>Richardoestesia</i>
will survive synonymization. Longrich (2008) proposed such a synonymy
based on the weak longitudinal ridges on some <i>Richardoestesia</i>
teeth, but Larson (2008) noted other contemporaneous theropods
sometimes have weak ridges too (tyrannosaurids, 'velociraptorines') and
that varied morphologies probably reflect positional variation in <i>Paronychodon</i>
teeth. Thus it is unlikely they existed in the same jaws as <i>Richardoestesia</i>
teeth.<br>
Sues and Averianov (in prep.) will propose that <i>Paronychodon</i>
are juvenile deinonychosaurs, probably in part based on <i>Zapsalis</i>-like
specimens which mix 'paronychodontid' longitudinal ridges with
dromaeosaurid-like serrations and are dromaeosaurid premaxillary teeth
(Currie and Evans, 2019). It is true that <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth
are smaller than <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> teeth in the Dinosaur Park
Formation, for instance, and that embryonic <i>Troodon</i> has
serrationless teeth.  This has not been published besides a
mention by Averianov (2007) though, so is difficult to evaluate. 
Similarly, Kirkland (pers. comm. to Demirjian, 9-2019) stated "<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3" style="">Baby
<span style="font-style: italic;">Utahraptor</span> premaxilla are
comparable to "<span style="font-style: italic;">Paranychodon</span>."",
giving more credance to the idea.</span><br>
Hwang (2005, 2007) found that <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth are identical
in enamel microstructure to serrationless troodontids like <i>Byronosaurus</i>
and IGM 100/1323, while <i>Richardoestesia</i> more closely matched
dromaeosaurids. Thus they are here placed as basal troodontids.<br>
<b>Pachycephalosaur fangs?</b>- An odd possibility was suggested by
Olshevsky (DML, 1997), that some <i>Paronychodon</i> specimens,
including the holotype, may be anterior dentary fangs of
"homalocephalid" pachycephalosaurs (cf. <i>Goyocephale</i>) . However,
the dentary fangs of <i>Goyocephale</i> are serrated distally,
polygonal in section, have a bulbous root, and seem to only possess one
lingual ridge. Premaxillary teeth of <i>Goyocephale</i> are somewhat
similar to type B teeth of <i>Paronychodon</i>, but lack ridges, are
much less labiolingually compressed, and have distal serrations
apically. <i>Stegoceras</i> teeth are even less similar, being
serrated both mesially and distally with no ridges. The supposed Middle
Jurassic pachycephalosaur <i>Ferganocephale</i> has vertical enamel
ridges on the base of one side and lacks serrations, but is otherwise
highly distinct, being unrecurved, short and uncompressed
labiolingually, with a prominent cingulum. The ridges radiate from the
base instead of the apex and the entire tooth shape is distinctively
ornithischian. Besides the anatomical differences, stratigraphically <i>Paronychodon</i>
and "homalocephalids" are also mismatched, with the latter only known
from the Campanian-Maastrichtian of Mongolia and perhaps China. The
utter lack of "homalocephalids" in well sampled strata like the
Dinosaur Park Formation is particularily telling. Also notable is that
each "homalocephalid" only had eight fang-like teeth, but had around
sixty-six leaf-shaped teeth. So we would expect more pachycephalosaur
teeth by a factor of 8:1 or so (even more in Maastrichtian formations
where pachycephalosaurines dominate, with no premaxillary teeth and
greater numbers of cheek teeth), but Baszio (1997) showed this is not
the case. For instance, he recorded 12 <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth from
the Dinosaur Park Formation, and only 16 pachycephalosaur teeth.
Similarly, Baszio recorded 84 <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth from the Milk
River Formation, but only 16 pachycephalosaur teeth. Finally, Zinke and
Rauhut (1994) described 'paronychodontid' teeth within a theropod
dentary fragment, though these differ from <i>Paronychodon</i> in some
details.<br>
<b>Junior synonyms</b>?-<i> Zapsalis</i> was based on a tooth described
by Cope (1876) and synonymized with <i>Paronychodon</i> <i>lacustris</i>
by Estes (1964). However, <i>Zapsalis</i> falls outside the current
concept of <i>Paronychodon</i> in having serrations, and is more
robust than teeth of that genus as well. Instead it matches ?<i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
morphotype A of Sankey et al. (2002) and was recently found by Currie
and Evans (2019) to be identical to premaxillary teeth
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornitholestes</span>.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Bambiraptor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> also have lingual
ridges, so that <span style="font-style: italic;">Zapsalis</span> is
here considered a morphotype of dromaeosaurid premaxillary teeth.<br>
<i>Tripriodon</i> was based on teeth assigned to two species by Marsh
(1889)- the genotype <i>T. coelatus</i>, and <i>T. caperatus</i>. The
former is a junior synonym of the multituberculate <i>Meniscoessus
robustus</i> (as first shown by Osborn, 1891), while the second belongs
to <i>Paronychodon</i> (as first shown by Estes, 1964). Estes was
incorrect in synonymizing <i>Tripriodon</i> itself with <i>Paronychodon</i>
however, as <i>T. caperatus</i> is only a referred species. This also
prevents Marsh's Tripriodontidae from being a theropod family.<br>
Three teeth were originally referred to <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i>
(Antunes and Brion, 1988), but later described as the new genus <i>Euronychodon</i>
by Antunes and Sigogneau-Russell (1992). This was based on the supposed
absence of longitudinal depressions and a median ridge. Yet
longitudinal depressions appear to be present in the figure, while
identical ridge patterns are seen in some <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth
(e.g. Milk River specimens). <i>Euronychodon</i> is thus retained as a
junior synonym of <i>Paronychodon</i> here (as in Sige et al., 1997,
Rauhut, 2002 and Sues and Averianov, 2013). Numerous other teeth were
later referred to <i>Euronychodon</i> from the Barremian-Maastrichtian
of Eurasia, but they are here listed as <i>Paronychodon</i> or unnamed
'paronychodontids'.<br>
<b>Variation</b>- Sankey et al. (2002) showed there are two morphotypes
of <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth. Type A teeth are elongate and
straighter, with unconstricted bases. Type B teeth are short and
strongly recurved, with constricted bases. They interpreted these are
being due to positional variation instead of taxonomic varation, though
it should be noted that the holotypes of both <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i>
and <i>Tripriodon caperatus</i> are type A teeth. Thus if taxonomic
variation proves correct, these names should only be associated with
type A teeth. Based on comparison to other theropods, type B teeth may
be more posterior in position.<br>
Baszio (1997) noted that half the teeth are flat lingually, and the
other half are biconvex. He considered this due to positional
variation, with biconvex teeth being from the posterior portion of the
jaw. The FABL, BW and FABL/BW measurements of lingually flat teeth were
not significantly different from those of biconvex teeth. Again, the
holotypes of both <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i> and <i>Tripriodon
caperatus</i> are flattened lingually, which should restrict the names
to lingually flat teeth if the variation is later shown to be taxonomic.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
The holotype has a FABL of 4 mm and a BW of 2.4 mm. It is recurved and
flattened lingually with four lingual ridges and six labial ridges.
Serrations are absent. It is not from the Hell Creek Formation, contra
some sources. Though Sankey et al. (2002) claimed it is not
illustrated, Glut (1997) included a photo. Note the collection number
also includes other material such as the incomplete theropod tibia
photographed on the AMNH database website.  Baszio (1997) stated
that <i>Paronychodon</i> teeth from the Judith River Group, Milk River
Formation and Frenchman Formations were identical. Sullivan and Lucas
(2006) in turn stated that SMP VP-1354 from the Kirtland Formation is
identical to Milk River teeth. All of these are smaller and with less
defined ridges than the Lance Formation species. They can be referred
to the species <i>P. lacustris</i>, while the Lance Formation material
can be referred to <i>P. caperatus</i>. It's probable other
Campanian-Maastrichtian <i>Paronychodon</i> remains (listed as <i>P.
sp.</i> below) will be referrable to <i>P. lacustris</i> once they are
examined in more detail. Furthermore, this <i>P. lacustris</i>
morphotype probably belonged to several different species which
differed in non-dental characters, which explains its apparently wide
distribution.<br>

(YPM 10630) partial type A tooth (Marsh, 1889)<br>
(YPM coll.) tooth (Osborn, 1891)<br>
tooth (Breithaupt, 2001) <br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Sahni, 1972) larger than <i>P. lacustris</i>
and with better defined ridges.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Marsh (1889) originally described <i>Tripriodon
caperatus</i> based on several teeth and tooth fragments discovered
that year, including supposed lower incisors. The holotype is often
listed as YPM 11853, but is 11852 in the YPM online catalog. Although
Marsh states the specimen came from Laramie beds, the Laramie Formation
has not yielded dinosaurs in Wyoming, and the YPM online catalog
confirms it was actually found in the Lance Formation. Marsh viewed <i>T.
caperatus</i> and the genotype <i>T. coelatus</i> as belonging to a
new family Tripriodontidae in his Allotheria, most closely related to <i>Stereognathus</i>
(now recognized as a tritylodontid). <i>Tripriodon coelatus</i> is
based on a molar which is now thought to belong to <i>Meniscoessus
robustus</i>, a species of multituberculate. This was first recognized
by Osborn (1891), who believed <i>T. caperatus</i> were lower incisors
of <i>Meniscoessus</i>. Osborn also recognized supposed lower incisors
of <i>Selenacodon brevis</i> (YPM 10630) and <i>Tripriodon coelatus</i>
(YPM coll.) have the same morphology as <i>T. caperatus</i>. <i>Selenacodon
brevis</i> is now viewed as a junior synonym of the multituberculate <i>Cimolemys
gracilis</i>. Estes (1964) incorrectly believed <i>T. caperatus</i> to
be the genotype, and was the first of many authors to synonymize <i>Tripriodon</i>
with <i>Paronychodon</i>. He referred the <i>T. caperatus</i>
holotype and YPM 10630 to <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i>. Currie et al.
(1990) mistakenly listed <i>Dipriodon caperatus</i>, but <i>Dipriodon</i>
is another genus now viewed as a synonym of <i>Meniscoessus</i>.<br>
The holotype tooth seems nearly identical to the <i>Paronychodon</i>
holotype except for having a shorter crown. It clearly matches tooth
type A of Sankey et al. (2002). Baszio (1997) notes these Lance
Formation teeth are larger than <i>Paronychodon lacustris </i> from
the Milk River, Dinosaur Park, Frenchman and Horseshoe Canyon
Formations, with more pronounced wrinkles. They are retained as <i>Paronychodon
caperatus</i> here, after Olshevsky (1991). UA BTB 166 is unique in
being biconvex with helical ridges.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- MNA Pl. 1627 were listed as <i>Paronychodon lacustris</i>
by Armstrong-Ziegler (1978), but later as Dromaeosauridae incertae
sedis by Lucas et al. (1987). Williamson and Brusatte (2014) note this
differs from Dinosaur Park <i>Paronychodon</i> in having "less
pronounced apicobasal ridges and in lacking ridges that anastomose from
the apex to the base of the crown." Some resemble <i>Zapsalis</i>
except for lacking distal serrations, so may belong to that taxon.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- These teeth were originally referred to <i>Paronychodon
lacustris</i> (Antunes and Brion, 1988). They were later described as
the new genus <i>Euronychodon</i> by Antunes and Sigogneau-Russell
(1992) based on the supposed absence of longitudinal depressions and a
median ridge. Yet longitudinal depressions appear to be present in the
figure, while identical ridge patterns are seen in some <i>Paronychodon</i>
teeth (e.g. Milk River specimens). <i>Euronychodon</i> is thus
retained as a junior synonym of <i>Paronychodon</i> here (as in
Rauhut, 2002).<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Sues and Averianov, 2013) can differ from <i>P.

versus up to 14).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- These teeth were first described as?Plesiosauria
(Nessov, 1985) and <i>Paronychodon cf. lacustris</i> (Nessov, 1986)
before being described as a new species of <i>Euronychodon</i> by
Nessov (1995). Nessov (1995) distinguished it from <i>Euronychodon
portucalensis</i> based on the presence of numerous labial grooves, but
the latter are seen in a paratype of <i>E. portucalensis</i>. Sues and
Averianov (2013) redescribed the teeth as <i>Paronychodon asiaticus</i>,
and noted some specimens were labelled "Plesiosaurodon" by Nessov.
Averianov (2007) first announced <i>Paronychodon sp.</i> from the
Khodzhakul Formation, which were also described by Sues and Averianov
and referred to <i>P. asiaticus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Norton (DML, 2000) noted this specimen was on display at the AMNH
Fighting Dinosaurs exhibit. Discovered in 1997 at Ukhaa Tolgod, it was
said to be "unpublished but noted as having "raptor like "
traits". 
Prieto-Marquez et al. (2011) state "troodontid specimen MAE 97-155" has
a manual phalanx III-3 identical to halszkaraptorine ISMD-VP09.  <br>

Material</b>- (IVPP V11119) two teeth, two caudal vertebrae, partial

<b>Comments</b>- Dong (1997) referred this to <i>Sinornithoides</i>
sp. nov. based on undescribed distal tarsal similarities, subequal
size, and the plesiomorphically limited proximal extent of the distal
articular surface on metatarsal III. However, he notes the less robust
metatarsal IV differs. This suggests the specimen was outside the <i>Sinornithoides</i>+<i>Troodon</i>
clade and should not be referred to the former genus.  Hartman et
al. (2019) recovered this as a coelurosaur outside several clades
including Troodontidae+Dromaeosauridae.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 2011) maxillary posterior ramus has
depth at mid-length exceeding that of dentary; surangular has little
lateral exposure and forms a wide, flat dorsal surface over posterior
part of mandible; extremely large surangular foramen &gt;6% of
mandibular length; posterior end of mandible blunt and dorsoventrally
expanded; proximalmost caudal centra less than half as long as
posterior dorsal centra; metacarpal III more robust than metacarpals I
and II; manual phalanx II-2 longer than metacarpal II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- As the holotype was acquired from a dealer with no
quarry information (prior to November 2010), <i>Xiaotingia</i> may
instead be from the Yixian Formation which outcrops in the same area.
Xu et al. (2011) used a version of Senter's TWiG matrix to place <i>Xiaotingia</i>
in Archaeopterygidae with <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Anchiornis</i>,
with the family in basal Deinonychosauria. More recently, Hartman et
al. (2019) used a far more extensive TWiG analysis to recover it as a
sinovenatorine troodontid.  As they state, "troodontid characters
present in <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiaotingia</span>
but not anchiornithines include distally positioned obturator process
(183:2), and characters shared with sinovenatorines include large
posterior surangular foramen (80:2), capital groove in humerus (458:1),
metacarpal III extending distally past metacarpal II (640:1), laterally
ridged ischium (182:2), and enlarged pedal ungual II (224:1). Forcing <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiaotingia</span>
into Archaeopterygidae requires nine more steps, which strongly
suggests it is not a member considering we included all of the TWiG
data originally used to place it there. Alternative placements as a
non-anchiornithine avialan (Lee et al., 2014), a dromaeosaurid (Senter
et al., 2012), and a scansoriopterygid relative (Lefèvre et al., 2017)
are eight, five, and 26 more steps, respectively."<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Xu et al., 2002) straight and vertical
anterior margin of antorbital fenestra (also in <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinusonasus</span>); surangular T-shaped
in cross-section; prominent lateral cnemial crest continuous with the
fibular crest.<br>
(after Yin et al., 2018) well-developed medial shelf on jugal; slender
bar in parasphenoid recess; lateral groove on pterygoid flange of
ectopterygoid; lateral surface of anterior cervical vertebrae bearing
two pneumatic foramina.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Xu et al.
(2002) proposed a frontal with a vertical lamina bordering the lacrimal
as diagnostic, but while present in the holotype this is missing in
PMOL-AD00102 (Yin et al., 2018).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Creisler (DML 2002) noted <i>Sinovenator changii</i>
was named after a woman, so suggested it be emended to <i>S. changiae</i>.
Similarly, Xu (2002) states Li indicated it should be <span style="font-style: italic;">S. changae</span>,
which is used in that thesis.  However, the Fourth Edition of the
ICZN no longer requires emendations based on this reasoning (Article
31.1.3- "The original spelling of a name formed under Articles 31.1.1
and 31.1.2 is to be preserved [Art. 32.2] unless it is incorrect [Arts.
32.3, 32.4]"), with Article 32.3 saying "The correct original spelling
of a name is to be preserved unaltered, except where it is mandatory to
change the suffix or the gender ending under Article 34" where Article
34 involves matching genus and species genders, and Article 32.4 saying
"An original spelling is an "incorrect original spelling" if it must be
corrected as required in Article 32.5" and Article 32.5 saying "
Incorrect transliteration or latinization ... are not to be considered
inadvertent errors". If <i>Sinovenator</i> "changiae" was published by
Haubold (2003) while <span style="font-style: italic;">S.</span>
"changae" was published by Long and Schouten (2008), but ICZN Article
32.2.3 states both are available names with their own authorships,
though objective junior synonyms of <i>S. changii</i>.<br>
The holotype and paratype were discovered in Summer 2001 (Xu, 2002) and
named and briefly described by Xu et al. (2002). A more detailed
description is in Xu's (2002) thesis, but has not yet been published.<br>
Senter (2007) mentioned an undescribed specimen whose photo was
available on www.dinosaur.net.cn (2004). This is IVPP V14322, and is
illustrated in Manabe (2005).<br>
White (2009) describes and illustrates the pes of an unregistered
specimen at the IVPP as <i>Sinovenator</i> sp.<br>
An undescribed basically complete specimen is referred to <i>Sinovenator</i>
on the Fossil Mall website (2015), but may be at least partially faked
due to its apparent lumbar region and non-maniraptoran forelimb
position.<br>
Yin et al. (2018) described a posterior skull of a new specimen
(PMOL-AD00102) that differs from the smaller holotype in a few
characters- frontal without vertical lamina bordering the lacrimal;
presence of a septum between the basal tubera; presence of a
basisphenoid recess; deep sagittal crest;  basipterygoid process
with a blunt distal end.  They considered these possibly
ontogenetic or taphonomic.<br>
Senter et al. (2004) corrected Xu et al.'s description of several
characters, finding the teeth to be unserrated, the antorbital fossa to
lack a prominent rim, the anterior and posterior dentary teeth to be
subequal in size and density, and the fourth metatarsal to be subequal
in diameter to the second. Senter (2007) later corrected his account of
dentary tooth density, agreeing with Xu et al. that the anterior teeth
were more densely packed.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?(CAGS-IG01-004) incomplete skeleton including skull
(Hwang et al., 2004)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Shen et al., 2017) prominent slender
triradiate postorbital; transition point in caudal series starts from
seventh caudal vertebra; deltopectoral crest distinctly extended to
distal half of humeral shaft; manual phalanx I-1 longer than metacarpal
II, ratio about 1.49; no posterodistal process on ischium; slender
obturator process on ischium; metatarsus width distally distinctly
decreases.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Shen et al. (2017) added <i>Liaoningvenator</i> to a
version of Senter's TWiG analysis and recovered it sister to <i>Eosinopteryx</i>
as an anchiornithine troodontid. Hartman et al. (2019) found it to be
sister to IGM 100/1126, closer to troodontines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Anchiornis</span> or
sinovenatorines.  Wwang et al. (2004) mentioned CAGS-IG01-004 as a
specimen from the Lujiatun as being similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>, so this may be a second
individual of <i>Liaoningvenator</i>. It was stated to have small
teeth with constricted bases and carinae lacking serrations, an
apparently absent postorbital (may be taphonomic), and no
quadratojugal-squamosal contact.<br>
Based on figures, I believe when Shen et al. state "The manual phalanx
III-1 is the longest", they meant phalanx II-2.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This specimens were collected in 1997. In the Fighting
Dinosaurs: New Discoveries from Mongolia exhibit at the AMNH in 2000,
it was displayed with troodontid postcrania. It is mislabeled on the
AMNH website that year as the <i>Shuvuuia</i> holotype, though it
differs in many respects from that taxon. A braincase analyzed by
Franzosa (2004) as the Zos Canyon troodontid and labeled IGM 100/1005
is the same specimen, as Dufeau (2003) includes a photo of the skull
labeled "IGM 100/1005 Undescribed troodontid".  Hwang et al.
(2004) refer to a second Ukhaa Tolgod basal troodontid skull (in
addition to <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>),
which based on their description I infer to be this specimen. Erickson
et al. (2009) examined the femur of an undescribed troodontid they call
IGM 100/1129, which is a misprint for this same specimen (Pei,
2015).  As of 2009, the skull was labeled IGM 100/1128 at the AMNH
(pers. obs. 6-21-2009), which is reflected by its number in Turner's
(2008) thesis.  By the publications of Turner et al. 2011 and 2012
the entire specimen was called IGM 100/1126, as it is in its
unpublished description by Pei (2015).  IGM 100/1126 was included
in Turner's TWiG analyses (2008; et al., 2011 and 2012), where it
emerged as a jinfengopterygine troodontid along with <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>.  Pei used a version of
Brusatte's TWiG analysis which recovered IGM 100/1126 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span> closer to troodontines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>
or jinfengopterygines. Hartman et al. (2019) used another version of
the TWiG analysis and found an intermediate topology where <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span> and IGM 100/1126 plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoningvenator</span> are closer to
troodontines and <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>
than sinovenatorines/<span style="font-style: italic;">Jinfengopteryx</span>.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span> was found in 1993, first
published as similar to possible <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoningvenator</span>
specimen CAGS-IG01-004 in having teeth of the same number and
morphology, and a modified diapsid configuration (Hwang et al.,
2004). 
Hwang (2005; 2007) describes the tooth morphology, while Erickson et
al. (2009) examined femoral histology.  Hwang (2007) also scored
it in
an early TWiG analysis, finding it to emerge sister to <i>Byronosaurus</i>. 
Turner (2008; published as Turner et al., 2012) also included it in a
TWiG analysis, finding it to emerge with <i>Jinfengopteryx</i>
and IGM 100/1126 as a jinfengopterygine troodontid. This was also found
in the related unpublished version shown in Turner et al. (2011). 
Pei
and Norell (2011) briefly described the holotype an an abstract, while
Pei (2015) later described <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>
in his thesis, which was published as Pei et al. (2017).  Pei used
a
version of Brusatte's TWiG analysis to recover it closer to
troodontines than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>
or jinfengopterygines.  The 2017 description doesn't include a
phylogenetic analysis but does describe characters placing <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span> in
that derived position.<br>
<b>Baby <i>Byronosaurus</i> and nest?</b> IGM 100/972 and 100/974 are
two juvenile skulls found associated with <i>Citipati</i> nest IGM
100/971 in 1993 (Norell et al., 1994). They were identified by Norell
et al. as <i>Velociraptor</i>, based on their long premaxillae (on IGM
100/974 at least). However, Norell and Makovicky (1999) stated that
Norell et al. (in press) will show they are actually troodontids. This
later became Bever and Norell (2008, 2009), who supported their
assignment to <i>Byronosaurus</i>, as did Grellet-Tinner (2005) for
100/972 at least. However, Pei and Norell (2011) referred at least IGM
100/972 to the then-unnamed <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas,</span>
based on (taller?) snout shape and less maxillary teeth compared to <i>Byronosaurus</i>,
but these are juvenile characters expected in any nestling. Adding to
the possibilities, IGM 100/1126 from the Djadohkta has serrationless
teeth, and embryonic <i>Troodon</i> lack serrations, so young
individuals of the contemporaneous <i>Saurornithoides</i> might as
well.  Sues and Averianov (2007) mistakenly state IGM 100/974 was
reidentified as an oviraptorid, and that the serrationless teeth were
actually maxillary palatal bumps, but they were confusing it with
embryonic <i>Citipati</i> specimen IGM 100/971.<br>
Discovered in 1995, Norton (DML, 2000) first stated "troodontid nest
with 13 hatched eggs and one hatchling skeleton" IGM 100/1003 was on
display at the AMNH's Fighting Dinosaurs exhibit. Clark et al. (2002)
noted an undescribed Ukhaa Tolgod troodontid nest with juveniles and an
adult tooth as being the subject of an upcoming paper, cited as Norell
et al., in prep.. Only the eggs have so far been described, in
Grellet-Tinner's (2005) thesis.
Grellet-Tinner (2005) determined eggshell attached to IGM 100/972's
skull is the same as that from that eroded nest, and that 100/972 was
found in the same location as 100/1003 but a few meters downhill. As
neither 100/972 or 100/974 were in situ in the <i>Citipati</i> nest,
it seems plausible they eroded out from 100/1003. If true, and Pei and
Norell are correct that 100/972 is not <i>Byronosaurus</i>, this would
eliminate referral of any nests or eggs to the latter genus.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The same thing?</span> Pei and
Norell (2011) already suggested IGM 100/974 and <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span> were the same
taxon, and Pei et al. (2017) state that among Djadokhta troodontids,
"the Ukhaa perinates IGM 100/972 and IGM 100/974 have a higher chance
of being closely related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas
ukhaa</span>."  They correctly note 100/972
lacks a lateral groove on the anterior dentary, and Bever and Norell
(2009) also state it has a posteriorly curved lateral flange on its
pterygoid (both unpreserved in 100/974), both proposed synapomorphies
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>.  Pei et al.'s
objection to them being conspecific is "both
specimens were found in a nest of eggs with sizes that are too large to
be those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas ukhaa</span>", but
the perinates were found in a nest of
Citipati eggs and the size of the eggs in IGM 100/1003 has not been
reported (Grellet-Tinner, 2005).  <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Chure's (1995) reference to "teeth ... most similar to ... troodontids"
from Dinosaur National Monument in Utah probably refers to <span style="font-style: italic;">Koparion</span>.<br>
Although Chure no longer thinks <i>Koparion</i> is a troodontid (pers.
comm. to Harris, 1997; in Naish, DML 1997), there are no other
suggested phylogenetic placements which are supported by the evidence.
Rauhut (2000) suggested it might be a compsognathid, but <i>Compsognathus</i>
differs in lacking mesial serrations. <i>Compsognathus</i>-like teeth
from Guimarota described by Zinke (1998) do have mesial serrations, but
<i>Koparion</i> differs in having blood pits, and less serrations per
mm on both carinae (8 and 7 on mesial and distal vs. 10-17 and 10-15 in
cf. <i>Compsognathus</i>) despite similar crown size. These are more
similar to derived troodontids. The only other theropods with
constricted tooth bases and serrated teeth are <i>Richardoestesia</i>-like
taxa and therizinosaurs. <i>Richardoestesia</i> and related taxa
differ in having highly elongate teeth with extremely numerous
serrations with no blood pits. Therizinosauroids have much larger
serrations (~3/mm in <i>Beipiaosaurus</i> and <i>Alxasaurus</i>),
while <i>Falcarius</i>' serration size is comparable. However,
maxillary teeth of <i>Falcarius</i> have convex distal edges with
serrations smaller in comparison to tooth size. Smaller posterior
dentary teeth are schematically illustrated as being more recurved, so
may be more comparable to <i>Koparion</i>. Therizinosaurs also lack
blood pits. <i>Koparion</i> differs from <i>Sinusonasus</i> in having
mesial serrations, though they are similar in having small distal
serrations without apically hooked tips. It differs from <i>Sinornithoides</i>
and <i>"Saurornithoides" asiamericanus</i> in having comparatively
smaller distal serrations (Currie and Dong, 2001), and having mesial
serrations on non-premaxillary teeth. It further differs from <i>"Saurornithoides"
americanus</i> in having distal serrations whose tips are not hooked.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype tooth was originally distinguished from <i>Troodon
formosus</i> by its smaller size, more labiolingually compressed
crowns, unserrated mesial carina and smaller distal serrations (Nessov,
1995). However, these characters are also seen in more basal
troodontids such as <i>Sinornithoides</i> and <i>Sinusonasus</i>
(Averianov and Sues, 2004). The referred teeth are indistinguishable
from the holotype.<br>

While Wang et al. described this as a new species of the Cenomanian <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span>, but they did not include
the Coniacian-Campanian <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
in their analysis.  They diagnosed <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span>
based on the following characters- strap-like and lightly-built dentary
with medially curved anterior end; symphyseal foramina; rugose
symphyseal facet; incrassate-shaped dentary teeth (width greater than
60% of length).  While not figured in dorsal/ventral view, Lu et
al. describe the dentary of <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
as "slightly inflected medially", state it possesses "a distinct
foramen is confluent with the inferior alveolar canal ... identical to
the condition in <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon itemirensi</span>s",
and all troodontid dentaries could be described as "strap-like and
lightly-built."  Regarding the symphyseal facet, <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span> has an anteroposteriorly
wide facet which is "slightly rugose", <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> has a slightly narrower
facet that is "only slightly rugose" and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span> has a very narrow facet
that appears smooth.  Finally, none of the three erupting tooth
crowns of <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> nor the
three dentary tooth crowns of <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
have been measured to indicate their thickness.  Taking the
specific diagnosis into account, <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span>
and perhaps <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span> have
a single symphyseal foramen unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span>;
the anteroventral dentary corner is below the second tooth in <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span>, the fifth or sixth in <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> and the fourth or fifth
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> are more similar to each
other than <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span>
in having a chin.  Wang et al. say "A total of 20 alveoli were
identified in the 65-mm-long preserved dentary (Figs 1b and 2b). In <span style="font-style: italic;">U. itemirensis</span>,
the 72-mm-long dentary tooth row accommodates 32 teeth, with the
anterior 20 alveoli spanning only 35 mm (Averianov and Sues,
2007).  This suggests that not only are the teeth themselves
proportionally smaller in <span style="font-style: italic;">U.
itemirensis</span> compared to those in <span style="font-style: italic;">U. norelli</span>,
but they are also more densely packed in the former taxon."  What
this doesn't establish is the necessary similar size of the
individuals, so that alveolar density per a given length is
meaningful.  As <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
has the least preserved alveoli (12 definable in medial view), dentary
depth at the posterior edge of the twelfth alveolus is used here to
estimate size.  Using this metric, the first twelve alveoli of <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span> are over 2.23 times the
height at alveolus 12, those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span>
are at 1.85 times the height of alveolus 12, and those of <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span> are 2.05 times the height
of alveolus 12.  Thus Wang et al. were correct that the teeth of <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span> are relatively larger than <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span>, and furthermore <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>' are even larger. 
In total, <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span> is less
similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
than they are to each other in- wider symphyseal facet; two symphyseal
foramina; anteriorly located anteroventral dentary corner (under second
alveolus vs ~fifth); no dentary chin.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span> is the outlier in
having a narrower symphyseal facet; smooth symphyseal facet; largest
teeth; so Wang et al.'s placement of <span style="font-style: italic;">norelli</span>
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
does not survive scrutiny.  Thus the species is placed here at the
common ancestor of both and should probably deserve its own genus.<br>
Wang et al. (2024) recovered this sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon itemirensis</span>, with both
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Zanabazar</span>,
using a version of Brusatte's TWiG analysis.  Added to a version
of Mortimer's maniraptoromorph analysis, it emerged sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>, hence the in depth
comparison above.  <br>

?(AMNH 27117) eleven teeth (Estes, 1964; AMNH online)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Sankey et al., 2002) tooth crowns flattened or
concave on one side; enamel pitted on flat/concave side; two
well-developed longitudinal ridges present on flat surface, one ridge
extending from the apex denticle to near the base of the enamel and the
second extending along the anterior carina; mesial serrations always
absent; distal serrations rounded.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This tooth morphology was considered a pathological
varient of <i>Troodon formosus</i> by Currie et al. (1990), who
referred to it as "<i>Paronychodon</i>" (<i>Troodon</i>). Sankey et al.
(2002) considered it a valid taxon though, based on its differing
temporal and spatial distribution than <i>Troodon formosus</i>.
Specifically, this taxon is restricted to the upper Dinosaur Park
Formation within the Judith River Group, and has not been reported from
the Prince Creek Formation where <i>T. formosus</i> is common. Sankey
et al. also referred teeth described by Estes (1964) as <i>cf.
Saurornithoides sp.</i> from the Lance Formation to this species, based
on figured specimen AMNH 8114. <i>Troodon bakkeri</i> from that
formation is not the same as this taxon, as it has pointed distal
serrations like <i>Troodon formosus</i>. It's highly possible
additional Late Cretaceous North American teeth currently identified as
<i>Troodon</i> belong to this taxon.<br>

this is notable as being the first described Early Cretaceous specimen

indet., its unique character combination in matrices indicates future
authors should compare IGM 100/44 in depth to the many Early Cretaceous

Barsbold et al. initially placed the specimen in the Barunbayaskaya

begins; metatarsal IV lacks prominent longitudinal flange.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Shen et al. (2017) state "<i>Daliansaurus</i>

that metacarpal II is slightly shorter than metacarpal III (instead of
longer)" but the manus is unknown in <i>Sinusonasus</i>.<br>

<i><b>T. nemegtensis</b></i> Kurzanov and Osmólska, 1991<br>
<b>Early Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous<br>
Nemegt, Nemegt Formation, Mongolia</b><br>
<b>Holotype</b>- (PIN 551-224) (~2.8 m) metatarsal II (233 mm),
metatarsal III (232 mm), metatarsal IV (242 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kurzanov and Osmólska, 1991) long, slender
metatarsus; strongly reduced metatarsal II.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This was found in 1948 and originally figured by
Kurzanov (1987) as an unknown theropod, then identified by Osmólska
(1987) as a troodontid. Although Osmólska speculated it might be a
specimen of <i>Borogovia</i>, Kurzanov and Osmólska (1991) noted the
distal end of metatarsal II is far more reduced in <i>Tochisaurus</i>.
Similarly, <i>Tochisaurus</i> differs from <i>Zanabazar</i> in having
metatarsal II narrower proximally, and the proximal surface of the
metatarsus inclined. It could not be compared to the earlier <i>Saurornithoides</i>,
however.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Tochisaurus</span>
was not included in published phylogenetic analyses until that of
Hartman et al. (2019), where it fell out sister to the earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">Daliansaurus</span>.  While this
should be considered provisional given the incomplete holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tochisaurus</span>, it is notable that <span style="font-style: italic;">Daliansaurus</span> has Kurzanov and
Osmólska's two proposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Tochisaurus</span>
auatpomorphies but to a more extreme degree.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
This specimen was discovered in Summer 2001 and announced in an
abstract (Lovelace, 2004). In Hartman et al.'s (2005) preliminary
analysis also reported via abstract and Wahl's (2006) thesis, it
emerged sister to <i>Sinornithoides</i> using the <span style="font-style: italic;">Mei</span>
TWiG matrix. Hartman et al. (2019) officially described and named the
taxon, using a new extensive TWiG analysis to place it most
parsimoniously sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Xixiasaurus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinusonasus</span>
slightly more stemward in Troodontidae.  As they state "a
placement as the first branching dromaeosaurid is just two steps
longer, supported by the dorsally placed maxillary fenestra, mesial
dental serrations, and large lateral teeth. This may be more compatible
stratigraphically, but moving <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornithoides</span>'
clade to a more stemward position in Troodontidae outside
Sinovenatorinae, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Liaoningvenator</span>-like
taxa and derived troodontids is also only two steps longer. Similarly,
in trees two steps longer than the MPTs where troodontids are avialans,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornithoides</span> can be the
first branching taxon closer to Aves than troodontids based on
homoplasic characters such as the short posterodorsal lacrimal process.
Two additional steps also place the taxon in contemporaneous
Archaeopterygidae, sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Caihong</span>
which shares [mesial dental serrations, large lateral teeth and
elongate but not hypertrophied distal caudal prezygapophyses]. Despite
the uncertainty of its position within Paraves, however, <span style="font-style: italic;">Hesperornithoides</span>
is strongly supported as a member of the Deinonychosauria plus Avialae
clade, as even constraining it to the paravian stem requires 15
additional steps."<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Note that while volume 30(10) of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences
lists its date as October 1993, it was not published until February or
March of 1994.  The holotype was discovered on August 6
1988.  Dong (1992) photographs and mentions this specimen as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>
new species (Russell and Dong in prep.)" before it was more fully
prepared.  Russell and Dong (1994) initially proposed the taxon
was stemward of <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Zanabazar</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Borogovia</span>, which has been recovered
in all analyses since.  Currie and Dong (2001) later described the
skeleton in more detail.<br>
Dong (1997) referred a fragmentary specimen (IVPP V11119) to <i>Sinornithoides</i>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Referred</span>- ?(HMNS coll.)
incomplete skull, incomplete mandibles, partial skeleton including two
manual phalanges (Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig, 2010)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>-
(after Tsuihiji et al., 2014) pointed anterior end of fused parietal
that wedges into V-shaped notch between frontals; gracile anterior,
posterior and ventral rami of postorbital; fossa on surangular in front
of  posterior surangular foramen; dorsoventrally elongated
proximal chevrons (up to 4.5 times as long as the height of the
preceding caudal vertebrae).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobivenator</span>
was discovered on June 15 and/or 23 2007 (Saneyoshi et al., 2010),
mentioned as "jaw and associated skeletons of a Troodontidae" with
field number 070623 DK CHZ.  Whether the partial dentary with
teeth shown in figure 8B as "Lower jaw of Troodontidae" belongs to the
holotype is unknown, as only the opposite mandible is shown in its
description.  Tsuihiji et al. (2010) presented the specimen in an
abstract, recovering it as sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Byronosaurus</span>
in a preliminary phylogenetic analysis.  Tsuihiji et al. (2014)
later described the taxon in more detail and named it, this time
recovering <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobivenator</span> as
sister to troodontines with <span style="font-style: italic;">Byronosaurus</span>
very basal based on a version of Senter's TWiG matrix.  Most
recently, Hartman et al.'s (2019) extensive TWiG matrix found it
similarly close to troodontines but with <span style="font-style: italic;">Byronosaurus</span> just slightly more
stemward. <br>
A skull photographed by Tsogtbaatar and Chinzorig (2010) as "a
troodontid from Tugrikin Shire" (Fig. 3) seems most similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobivenator</span>
(~88% of the holotype's size) in that it has the slender postorbital
and at least ventrally defined surangular fossa, while strongly
differing from <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Byronosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Almas</span>
and IGM 100/1126 in various features.  Differences such as the
narrower interfenestral bar and undeveloped groove on the ventrolateral
maxilla, posteriorly angled dorsal jugal process and slender angular
could be individual variation or taxonomic.  It was originally
discovered on August 1 1994 and was misidentified in the field as <span style="font-style: italic;">Velociraptor</span> (field number 940801
TS-I WTB) (Watabe et al., 2000).  <br>

<b>Comments</b>- Nessov (1992, 1997) identified ZIN PO 4608 as an
ichthyornithine. Nessov (1993, 1997) identified CCMGE 71/12455 as
Deinonychosauria or Mammalia. Nessov (1995) identified CCMGE 2/11822 as
Theropoda indet., CCMGE 466/12457 as possibly dromaeosaurid, and CCMGE
475/12457 as possibly ornithomimid. Averianov and Sues (2007)
reidentified these and additional specimens as being troodontid,
assigned to <i>Urbacodon sp.</i> due to the resemblence of the dental
and dentary remains to the <i>U. itemirensis</i> holotype. The
material was described in depth by Averianov and Sues (2016), except
for the braincase CCMGE 466/12457 which will be described in a future
publication on troodontid endocrania. Using a reweighted version of the
TWiG analysis, the authors recovered <i>Urbacodon</i> as sister to <i>Gobivenator</i>
outside Troodontinae. <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Martyniuk (2012) used three troodontid subfamilies, Jinfengopteryginae,
Troodontinae and Saurornithoidinae, but did not define the
latter.  If ICZN rules are followed so that a subfamily cannot
contain a subfamily, Saurornithoidinae cannot exist given <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>
is an internal specifier of Troodontinae.  van der Reest and
Currie's (2017) more inclusive definition of Troodontinae is invalid as
it does not include <i>Troodon</i>,
the eponymous genus (Phylocode Article 11.7).  Hendrickx et al.'s
(2019) definition includes all troodontids except anchiornithines if
they belong here instead of as archaeopterygids, and is unlikely to
catch on if Sinovenatorinae is used.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?(NMMNH P-68396) tooth (4.8x5.5x2.9 mm) (Williamson
and Brusatte, 2014)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- Provisionally indeterminate relative to <i>Troodon
formosus</i>, and incomparable to <i>Talos</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Sullivan (2006) used the ratio of length
(measured along the midline) to thickness (posterior part of the
frontal) being 6:1 to distinguish <i>robustus</i> from <i>S. langstoni</i>,
but this matches the condition in <i>Troodon formosus</i> once wear in
<i>robustus</i> is accounted for. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in summer 2005, Sullivan (2006) originally
described the frontal as a new species of the dromaeosaurid <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
distinguished from <i>S. langstoni</i> by its greater thickness.
Turner et al. (2012) stated the holotype lacks the synapomorphies of <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
but listed no characters of that genus. They instead placed it as
Theropoda indet..  Evans et al. (2014) reexamined the specimen and
determined it was nearly identical to <i>Troodon</i> and indeterminate
among derived troodontids. The tooth was said to fall within the range
of variation of Dinosaur Park <i>Troodon</i> teeth by Williamson and
Brusatte (2014). <br>

though, not more basal forms (IGM 100/44, <i>Sinornithoides</i>, <i>Borogovia</i>).
Thus IGM-7710 may be more closely related to the former two genera.
Evans et al. (2014) believe this may belong to a turtle instead.<br>

metatarsal III (Currie and Eberth, 1993)<br>
<b>Comments-</b>
Currie and Eberth (1993) stated "Troodontid bones are rare, but include
distinctive third metatarsals (AMNH 21751, 21772, IVPP 230090-16), in
which the distal articulation extends onto the posterior surfrace of
the bone in a broad tongue."  However, Currie and Dong (2001)
corrected the identification of the second specimen, stating "AMNH
21772 is the proximal end of a second metatarsal. It is identified as a
troodontid on the basis of its contact surface for the fourth
metatarsal, its size, and especially its lateromedial
compression."  The AMNH online catalogue photo indicates most of
the element is preserved and the locality info is "8 mi. E. of station"
indicating it was found in localities 140-149 in 1923 or 1928. 
Currie and Dong describe AMNH 21751 as "two distal ends of third
metatarsals [that] are about the same size and represent left and right
elements. Although they may represent the same individual, the two
fossils are different colours, which suggests they may not have been
found together."  They indicate these were "Collected in the 1920s
by the third Central Asiatic Expedition from exposures of the Iren
Dabasu Formation (?Santonian) near Erenhot."  Currie and Dong list
IVPP 230790-16 (presumably the correct field number for Currie and
Eberth's 'IVPP 230090-16') as a metatarsal "Collected in 1990 from
exposures of the Iren Dabasu Formation (?Santonian) near Erenhot",
which would make it found during the second Sino-Canadian
expedition.  They state "the tongue-like extensions of the third
metatarsals from Iren Dabasu are flat like those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> ... , <span style="font-style: italic;">Borogovia</span> ... , and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tochisaurus</span>" but unlike the grooved
surface of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span> or
the distally restricted surface of <span style="font-style: italic;">Philovenator</span>. 
This has since been identified in Bissekty <span style="font-style: italic;">Urbacodon</span> sp. ZIN PH 2342/16, and
it should be noted the extension of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tochisaurus</span>
is much shorter, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Mei</span>,
IGM 100/44, 100/140 and 100/1126 have a condition like <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>.  Thus as
hypothesized by Dong and Currie, at least AMNH 21751 and IVPP 230790-16
are closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> than <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithoides</span>.  Currie and

Makovicky (1995) stated "A probable troodontid axis (AMNH 6570),
articulated with a third cervical vertebra, is present in the
collections of the American Museum of Natural History. This
identification is based on the morphology of the associated third
cervical and a probable fifth cervical, possibly from the same
individual, which strongly resembles those of <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>.
The axis is from an immature individual as seen from absence of both
the odontoid and axial intercentrum."  This specimen number
includes over two hundred paratype <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
elements from the Kaisen Quarry AMNH locality 140, and the cervicals
described were not recognized in the material catalogued under it in
July 2009 (pers. obs.).  However, a small ungual was noticed in
AMNH 6576 (which includes almost a hundred paratype <span style="font-style: italic;">Archaeornithomimus</span>
elements from the Johnson Quarry AMNH locality 141) that most closely
resembles a troodontid pedal ungual I in the slight curvature,
proximally placed flexor tubercle and posterodorsal extent being less
than its posteroventral extent.<br>
The AMNH online catalogue lists AMNH 25570 as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon ?</span>",
consisting of "3 vertebrae."  A large number of elements (AMNH
30261-30297, 30300-30318, 30320-30330, 30336-30359) are labeled are
labeled "Troodontid" on the AMNH online catalogue, each from the same
location ("8 mi. E. of station") and from AMNH Quarry 142 specifically
when visible in the photo (AMNH 30265, 30266, 32069, 30300, 30301,
30303, 30320).  Given the similar preservation and number of
elements preserved, it is possible these represent two individuals, and
that several other specimens only identified to the level of Saurischia
in the online catalogue (AMNH 30245, 30247-30260, 30298-30299, 30360)
that are also from "8 mi. E. of station" may belong to them as
well.  Note AMNH 30267 is incorrectly identified as a proximal
fibula, while 30288 is called "Proximal end of metatarsal IV" but seems
to be two vertebrae instead, AMNH 30301 is called an "Ilium fragment."
but may be a proximal pubis (posterior edge downward in photo), AMNH
30302 is labeled as "Acetabulum fragment." and indeed may be the
ischial peduncle and postacetabular base of a left ilium, AMNH 30304 is
labeled "Prox. end of ischium" but more closely resembles a proximal
troodontid pubis in the diverging peduncles and shallowly concave
acetabular edge, AMNH 30305 is a last sacral vertebra with a convex
posterior central face and 30322 is an anterior dorsal with convex
anterior central face so both may be alvarezsaurid instead. 
Scoring the material as photographed in the online catalogue (with AMNH
30305 and 30322 excluded, and 30301 and 30304 interpreted as pubes)
into Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix does result in it being
troodontid, but note examination of the specimens themselves would
provide far more data for each element and that it's currently only an
assumption that they belong to the same taxon.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- This was described by Mathur and Srivastava (1987) as
(?) <i>Megalosaurus</i>
type E.  It was listed under Troodontidae by Ford (online
2015).  The
tooth is strongly recurved and short with subequal (10 per 5 mm), blunt
serrations on the mesial and distal carinae, absent apically.  It
differs from Kallamedu Formation tooth DUGF/52 in being narrower, with
a more concave distal edge and serrations absent apically.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- More derived than <i>Sinornithoides</i> and <i>Sinusonasus</i>
due to the absent promaxillary fenestra, large serrations on teeth, and
six sacral vertebrae. Less derived than <i>Zanabazar</i> and <i>Troodon</i>
due to the dorsal tympanic recess.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Osborn (1924b) was the first to publish a
diagnosis, but as the specimen was the first troodontid known from more
than teeth, the generic diagnosis is now far too generalized. The
presence of five pairs of external cranial fenestrae is incorrect, as
Osborn did not take the supratemporal fenestrae into account, but six
pairs are primitive for tetanurines anyway. The external mandibular
fenestra is primitive for archosaurs, while the fairly homodont
maxillary series is primitive for an even more inclusive group. The
presence of nineteen premaxillary and maxillary teeth is incorrect, as
there are actually twenty-three. The "less raptorial" teeth are also
found in other maniraptoriforms except dromaeosaurids. Teeth which have
only distal serrations are also now known in several other troodontids
(e.g. <i>Sinornithoides</i>, <i>Sinusonasus</i>, <i>Zanabazar</i>).
Maxillary teeth which lack replacement gaps are also present in <i>Mei</i>,
<i>Sinovenator</i> and basal avialans, so may be plesiomorphic. Of his
listed "specific characters", the posteriorly increasing size of
maxillary teeth, closely spaced dentary teeth, and teeth with a
sub-acute tip are common in troodontids. The premaxillary teeth do not
decrease in size posteriorly though, as the first tooth is small, the
second unpreserved, and the third and fourth subequal (Norell et al.,
2009). The illusion of decreasing size is due to the length of the
roots which are exposed. Flattened, recurved teeth are primitive for
archosaurs<br>
Norell et al. (2009) listed several characters in their diagnosis, as
they differ from <i>Zanabazar</i>. While <i>Saurornithoides</i> is
smaller than <i>Zanabazar</i>, Norell et al. note all other named
troodontids except perhaps <i>Troodon</i> are as well. Norell et al.
also distinguish it from <i>Zanabazar</i> by its low tooth count (19
maxillary teeth and ~31-33 dentary teeth), but <i>Sinornithoides</i>
(18 maxillary teeth), <i>Sinusonasus</i> (~19 maxillary teeth) and <i>Urbacodon</i>
(32 dentary teeth) are similar. A jugal with a straight ventral edge
below the front of the orbit is also present in <i>Mei</i> and
seemingly <i>Sinornithoides</i>, and is somewhat uncertain in <i>Saurornithoides</i>
due to breakage in any case. The dorsal tympanic recess is
plesiomorphic, being present in <i>Byronosaurus</i> and <i>Sinovenator</i>
as well. Norell et al. note their last listed character (maxillary
teeth with only slight posterior increase in height) is also present in
<i>Mei</i>, <i>Sinovenator</i> and basal avialans, so may be
plesiomorphic.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered on July 9 1923 and
initially announced in a magazine article (Osborn, 1924a) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornithoides oshiensis</span>,
"a dinosaur birdlike in its skull form", "a name given in allusion to
the fact that the reptile was found in the basin Oshih, with numerous
teeth."  A partial sacrum, three mid caudal vertebrae and two
partial ilia were originally included in the holotype, but were
reidentified as protoceratopsian by Norell et al. (2009) and placed in
the new number AMNH 30613.  Currie and Peng (1994) described 
hindlimb IVPP V10597 as a possible juvenile <i>Saurornithoides
mongoliensis</i>, but this was made the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Philovenator curriei</span> by Xu et al.
in 2012.  Watabe and Suzuki (2000) mention "a <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>
partial skeleton" found on July 18 1997 at Hermiin Tsav, given field
number 970719 KmT AMRM-3.  It has not been described yet but may
belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Harenadraco</span>
discovered at the same locality 21 years later. 
Norell and Hwang (2004) described a fragmentary specimen found in 1993
they provisionally referred to <i>Saurornithoides mongoliensis</i>, as
it was identical except for being larger. Norell et al. noted
definitive referral was not possible, though they did state the tooth
replacement was more similar to <i>Saurornithoides</i> than to <i>Byronosaurus</i><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>. IVPP V10599 was mentioned by
Currie and Dong as being referrable to <i>Saurornithoides mongoliensis</i>
and having a sixth sacral vertebra derived from the caudal series, but
details including a rationale for the referral are lacking.  It
was discovered in 1988 as part of the Dinosaur Project, and may be
referrable to the troodontines <span style="font-style: italic;">Papiliovenator</span>
or <span style="font-style: italic;">Linhevenator</span> later
described from the same formation.<br>

<b>Referred</b>- ?(IGM 100/2) postcrania (Barsbold, 1983)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Norell et al., 2009) exoccipital forms large
part of posttemporal fenestra (unknown in other troodontids except <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>); deep paroccipital
processes, with proximodorsal edge above foramen magnum.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Barsbold (1974) originally only listed "large <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span> with 20 maxillary
and 35 dentary teeth" in his diagnosis. The large size is also seen in <i>Troodon</i>.
The maxillary tooth count (19-20) overlaps <i>Saurornithoides</i> (19)
and <i>Sinusonasus</i> (~19), while the dentary tooth count (35) is
the same as <i>Troodon</i>.<br>
Norell et al. (2009) also listed several other characters in their
diagnosis. The absent dorsal tympanic recess is shared with <i>Troodon</i>.
They note the foramen magnum is more transversely compressed than <i>Troodon</i>,
but that <i>Byronosaurus</i> and <i>Sinovenator</i> are similar,
making it plesiomorphic. Similarly, the lack of a separate canal for
the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is also seen in <i>Byronosaurus</i>
and most dromaeosaurids, meaning it is plesiomorphic as well.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1964 and initially
described by Barsbold (1974)as a new species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurornithoides</span>, from the earlier
Djadochta Formation.  Contrary to Barsbold, Norell et al. note the
teeth lack mesial serrations, the caudal vertebrae are probably not a
continuous series, and the distal fibula is unpreserved. However, they
also fail to note three proximal caudal vertebrae in their materials
list and description. Franzosa (2004) assigned this species to a new
genus "Mongolodon" without comment in his unpublished thesis. However,
Norell et al. (2009) later redescribed the species and made it the type
of their new genus <i>Zanabazar</i>. This was largely done because of
the absence of characters supporting a sister relationship with <i>Saurornithoides
mongoliensis</i>, though Norell et al. do not explicitly support a
closer relationship of either species to <i>Troodon</i> either.  <i>Borogovia</i>
may be a junior synonym (Osmólska, 1987), as its holotype cannot be
compared to IGM 100/1.  <i>Tochisaurus</i> is not a junior
synonym however (Kurzanov and Osmólska, 1991), though this was proposed
as possible by Osmólska.<br>
Barsbold (1983) states "besides the holotype, remains of the
postcranial skeleton of another specimen, no. 100/2" can be referred to
the taxon, but it has not been mentioned in other references. 
Norell et al. (2009) even state "the holotype remains the only known
specimen of this species" with Barsbold as a coauthor.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Currie, 1987a; compared to <i>Saurornithoides
</i>and<i> Zanabazar</i>) round anterior border of antiorbital
fenestra; sculpturing less extensive on nasal process of maxilla;
postorbital region of skull longer; no sulcus between parasphenoid
capsule and rectangular platform between basipterygoid processes;
mesethmoid located further anteriorly; very strong, caudoventrally
shifted basal tubera; otic recess extends further posteroventrally;
dentary symphysis more extensive; mesial serrations extend to tip of
carina on maxillary teeth.<br>
(after van der Reest and Currie, 2017; for <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>, but unknown in <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>)
17° retroverted pubis; anteriorly curving pubic shaft; large muscle
scar on lateral surface of pubic shaft slightly proximal to pubic boot.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- Leidy's (1856)
original description of <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>
included both generalized theropod characters ("compressed, curved,
conical crown with trenchant edges ... outer side is more convex than
the inner") and those now known to be present in other troodontines
("trenchant edges are coarsely denticulated; the denticulations
themselves being compressed conical, with trenchant edges, and are bent
in such a manner that their apices are directed towards the summit of
the crown").<br>
<strong>Comments</strong>- Brownstein (2024) figured YPM PU 22445 as &quot;a †<em>Troodon</em>-like troodontid from the Judith River Formation&quot;, but it is from the Two Medicine Formation (YPM online catalog). It was collected in August 1979 at Chateau in Teton County, Montana.<br>
<b>Ornithischian or theropod?</b>- <i>Troodon</i> was originally
discovered in October 1855 and identified as a lizard by Leidy (1856)
based on the holotype tooth, but reidentified as a theropod by Cope
(1877). Nopcsa (1901) and Hay (1902) placed it in Megalosauridae. Brown
(1908) placed it in Ankylosauridae, while Gilmore (1924) believed it
was a pachycephalosaurid and a senior synonym of <i>Stegoceras</i>.
Thus pachycephalosaurs were classified under Gilmore's new family
Troodontidae until Sternberg (1945) placed <i>Troodon</i> back in
Theropoda and named Pachycephalosauridae. Russell (1948) described a
partial dentary (ROM 1445) of <i>Troodon</i>, assigning it to
Troodontidae within the Theropoda. A further confusion with
ornithischians occured when Galton (1983) suggested <i>"Laosaurus"
minimus</i> should be assigned to <i>Troodon</i> and that the latter
is a carnivorous ornithopod (first suggested by Baird, 1981). Galton
cited pers. comm. with Horner alluding to undescribed Two Medicine
Formation material. The latter turned out to be adults of the
ornithopod <i>Orodromeus</i> (Horner and Weishampel, 1988) associated
with <i>Troodon</i> teeth, eggs and embryos (Horner and Weishampel,
1996). The idea of <i>Troodon</i> as a carnivorous ornithopod was
never established in the technical literature, but was widespread in
the popular literature in the 1980's. Instead, it was almost always
assigned to Theropoda after 1945. <br>
<i><b>Laelaps cristatus</b></i>- Cope (1876) described two teeth as a
new species of <i>Laelaps</i> (in which he placed all Judithian
theropods). Once Marsh provided the replacement name <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
for the preoccupied <i>Laelaps</i>, Hay (1902) moved <i>cristatus</i>
to that genus. Osborn (1902) meanwhile referred it to <i>Deinodon</i>,
though this is not the same taxon as Hay's (1902) <i>Deinodon cristatus</i>,
which was a new combination of <i>Aublysodon cristatus</i>, a
tyrannosaurid premaxillary tooth. Matthew and Brown (1922) questionably
referred the species to their new genus <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, probably
based on size, for it was the smallest of their 'deinodontids'.
Olshevsky (1995) most recently referred it to <i>Troodon</i>, though
most workers have ignored it. This tooth can indeed be identified as <i>Troodon</i>
by its large serrations (2/mm distally, and slightly smaller mesially),
presence of mesial serrations and absence of longitudinal ridges. The
size (FABL 6 mm) and BW/FABL (.50) are also comparable to <i>Troodon</i>
maxillary teeth (Currie et al., 1990), as is the height/FABL (1.83).
The serrations are smaller than in premaxillary teeth, which is why
Cope kept it separate from <i>Troodon</i> (at the time only known from
the type premaxillary tooth). The tooth is larger than dentary teeth,
posterior examples of which also differ in lacking mesial serrations.
As it is from the same formation as <i>T. formosus</i> and lacks
distinguishing characters, it is referred to that species here.<br>
<i><b>Polyodontosaurus grandis</b></i>- Sternberg collected a dentary
(CMN 8540) from the same formation as Leidy's specimen, which Gilmore
(1932) described as a new genus of lizard- <i>Polyodontosaurus</i>.
Sternberg later (1951) assigned this genus to Troodontidae, noting it
may be congeneric with <i>Troodon</i>. The latter synonymization was
formalized by Romer in 1966, who assigned both to the Coeluridae. On
the other hand, Russell (1969) synonymized <i>Polyodontosaurus</i>
with <i>Stenonychosaurus</i> inequalis in the Troodontidae.<br>
<b><i>Stenonychosaurus</i> and <i>Saurornithoides</i></b>- Sternberg
(1932) named <i>Stenonychosaurus inequalis</i> as a coelurid, based on
a fragmentary skeleton (CMN 8539). Sternberg later (1951) suggested <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
and <i>Troodon</i> might be synonymous, but no comparable elements
were known which could prove this. Russell (1969) described several
specimens found in 1968 as <i>Stenonychosaurus inequalis</i>,
assigning it to the Troodontidae along with <i>Saurornithoides</i> and
<i>Troodon</i>. He did not synonymize <i>Troodon</i> with <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
or <i>Saurornithoides</i> due to the fragmentary condition of the
former. Ostrom (1969) assigned both <i>Saurornithoides</i> and <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
to the Dromaeosauridae based on their raptorial second pedal digit,
though perhaps deserving subfamilial status. Barsbold (1974) noted
differences between the holotype of <i>Troodon</i> and teeth of <i>Saurornithoides</i>,
while feeling the cranial and postcranial resemblences between <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
and <i>Saurornithoides</i> justified a close relationship. He assigned
the latter two genera to his new family Saurornithoididae, while
retaining <i>Troodon</i> in Troodontidae. This was followed until
Currie (1987a). Sues (1977) described two new dentaries as
saurornithoidids, though he was uncertain if they belonged to <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
or <i>Saurornitholestes</i> (which was assigned to Dromaeosauridae
once he described it the next year). <i>Stenonychosaurus</i> was
generally used for the Dinosaur Park troodontid through the 1980's
(e.g. Currie, 1985), though Carpenter (1982) synonymized it with <i>Saurornithoides</i>,
as <i>Saurornithoides inequalis</i>. This was done without
justification however, referencing a Carpenter and Paul in prep.
publication which never emerged. Paul did later (1988) synonymize <i>Saurornithoides</i>
with <i>Troodon</i> (including <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>), but this is
a subjective decision which has not been accepted by later authors.<br>
Estes (1964) originally referred several teeth from the Lance Formation
of Wyoming to <i>Saurornithoides sp.</i>. Carpenter (1982) named <i>Pectinodon
bakkeri</i> from the same formation, believing some of Estes' specimens
to be referrable to that species, some to his new combination <i>Saurornithoides
inequalis</i>, and others to an unnamed third taxon. He assigned <i>Pectinodon</i>
to the Saurornithoididae.<br>
<b>Currie's breakthrough</b>- Currie (1987a) cleared up the American
troodontid situation, determining the differences between known
dentaries were ontogenetic, and dental differences between <i>Troodon</i>,
ROM 1445, <i>Saurornithoides</i> and the Lance Formation specimens
were largely due to variation within the tooth row. <i>Troodon</i>'s
holotype is a premaxillary tooth, the teeth of <i>Saurornithoides</i>
which Barsbold compared were maxillary (as were Carpenter's <i>Saurornithoides
inequalis</i> examples), <i>Pectinodon</i> was based on posterior
dentary teeth, while ROM 1445 contains a few dentary teeth. Currie
described intermediates between all of these morphologies, although he
noted the maxillary mesial serrations are more extensive in <i>Troodon</i>
than <i>Saurornithoides</i>, extending to the tip of the tooth. He
synonymized <i>Stenonychosaurus inequalis</i> and <i>Polyodontosaurus
grandis</i> with <i>Troodon formosus</i>, and provisionally did the
same for <i>Pectinodon bakkeri</i>. This has remained the consensus,
along with the assignment of <i>Saurornithoides</i>, <i>Troodon</i>
and related taxa to the Troodontidae. <br>
<b>Overlumped?</b>- Recently the concept of all Campanian-Maastrichtian
North American troodontids being one taxon has been questioned. Currie
et al. (1990) noted that though Horseshoe Canyon Formation troodontid
teeth are essentially identical to those from the Judith River
Group/Formation, teeth from the Frenchman, Hell Creek, Lance, Prince
Creek and Scollard Formations are different and may prove to be
separate species. Baszio (1997) elaborated, describing differences
between teeth from the Judith River, Horseshoe Canyon and Scollard
Formations. Olshevsky (1991) created the new combination <i>Troodon
bakkeri</i> for the Lance Formation material, while several papers have
used the combination <i>Troodon inequalis</i> for the Dinosaur Park
Formation taxon (Snively, 2002; Osmólska, 2004; Currie, 2005). Currie
(2005) stated that it is more conservative to retain <i>inequalis</i>
for Dinosaur Park specimens, but keeping taxa separate based on a
political boundary (Montana vs. Alberta) has no biological value. <br>
Morhardt et al. (2013) and Evans et al. (2017) both describe cranial
differences between Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon specimens, Evans
et al. naming frontals from the latter formation <i>Albertavenator
curriei</i>. Sankey et al. (2002) have split Dinosaur Park Formation
troodontids into <i>Troodon formosus</i> and cf. Troodontidae indet.,
with the latter being a rare form only present in some formations and
distinguished by various dental characters. If they are correct, most
of the non-dental specimens (including the <i>Stenonychosaurus</i>
holotype and CMN 12340) could not be definitively assigned to either
taxon, and many poorly or undescribed <i>Troodon</i> teeth could end
up not being referrable to that genus. Conversely, Evans et al. (2017)
analyzed teeth morphometrically and recovered the <i>Troodon</i>
holotype very close to an apparent premaxillary tooth from the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which may indicate premaxillary teeth of <i>Albertavenator</i>
cannot be distinguished from <i>Troodon</i> and thus the latter is
indeterminate. They note the frontals can be distinguished, and that
CMN 12340 allows connecting frontal morphology with the supposedly
diagnostic pedal anatomy of <i>Stenonychosaurus inequalis</i>. This
could support a valid <i>Stenonychosaurus</i> and <i>Albertavenator</i>.
However, there is only stratigraphic evidence to connect any teeth with
<i>Albertavenator</i>, so it's also possible e.g. that particular
Hoseshoe Canyon tooth is <i>Troodon</i>, and that the three widely
separated premaxillary teeth in the lower left of their figure 6j are <i>Albertavenator</i>. 
<br>
Most recently, van der Reest and Currie (2017) have used frontal and
metatarsal III differences correlated with stratigraphy to divide
Dinosaur Park troodontids into smaller, earlier <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus inequalis</span>
(diagnosis- L-shaped frontal with a flat shallowly anteroposteriorly
rippled nasofrontal contact; convex anterior surface of metatarsal III)
and larger, later <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix
mcmasterae</span>
(diagnosis- triangular frontal with a single deep groove in the
frontonasal contact surface; concave anterior surface of metatarsal
III) with CMN 12340 as the holotype.  Further noted differences
are anteriorly expanded parietal sagittal crest and anteriorly limited
medial recurvature of dentary in <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>. 
In addition to their specimen identifications, RTMP 86.49.10 has a <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>
morphology (Currie, 1987b), while RTMP 67.14.39 (Sues, 1977), RTMP
83.12.11 (Evans et al., 2017), RTMP 93.36.86 (Evans et al., 2017) and
YPM PU 23414 (Currie, 1985) have a <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>
morphology.  Notably, this does not allow any teeth including the <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> holotype to be referred to
either taxon, nor any described material from the Judith River
Formation of Montana where <span style="font-style: italic;">T.
formosus</span>' holotype is from.  Also, the holotype dentary of <span style="font-style: italic;">Polyodontosaurus grandis</span> was
reported to be placed stratigraphically high in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>
range (Gilmore, 1932) although van der Reest and Currie bring up
potential sources for error.  Its extensive and strong medial
curvature also matches <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>
more than <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>,
but this is also present in e.g. ?<span style="font-style: italic;">Albertavenator</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Zanabazar</span> so is not an
autapomorphy, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>
dentary is only referred to that taxon based on stratigraphy.  So
there is evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">Polyodontosaurus</span>
is a senior synonym of <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>,
but this is uncertain.  A final factor is the identity of the Two
Medicine Formation troodontid, which has yet to be described in
detail.  van der Reest and Currie (2017) report that it and <span style="font-style: italic;">Talos</span> share the anteriorly convex
distal metatarsal III with <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span>,
unlike <span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Linhevenator</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Gobivenator</span>.  The skull roof
and dentary are not yet described.  If this taxon is described as <span style="font-style: italic;">Stenonychosaurus</span> or a new taxon,
it's likely <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span> will be
broken down on this site into several genera with the incomparable
Dinosaur Park specimens and current <span style="font-style: italic;">T?
sp.</span> being made into unnamed/undescribed/indet. Troodontinae.<br>
<b><i>Troodon</i> eggs and embryos</b>- Horner (1982) first reported
ten nests in the Two Medicine Formation which he ascribed to
ornithopods, "closely allied to the Hypsilophodontidae". Horner and
Weishampel later (1988) described a new genus of ornithopod from the
site, <i>Orodromeus makelai</i>. They believed abundant nest with eggs
and embryos belonged to <i>Orodromeus</i>, though this was disproven
by Horner and Weishampel (1996) due to the small size of adult <i>Orodromeus</i>
and the reidentification of an embryo as <i>Troodon</i>. Zelenitsky
and Hillis (1996) named eggs from the Oldman Formation of Alberta <i>Prismatoolithus
levis</i> (Prismatoolithidae), while Zelenitsky (2000) identified the
Two Medicine Formation <i>Troodon</i> eggs as belonging to this
oospecies as well. Most of the publications dealing with <i>Troodon</i>
since that time have concerned these nests, eggs and embryos.<br>
One confusing aspect is that <i>Continuoolithus canadensis</i> eggs
were provisionally assigned to <i>Troodon</i> by Horner (1984), based
on an embryo. This was followed by Hirsch and Quinn (1990) and Horner
(1994), until 1996. Horner (1997) found the embryo to be indeterminate,
while Varricchio and Jackson (2004) found the eggshell to be theropod.
The precise identity of <i>Continuoolithus</i> is still unknown.<br>
<b>Canadian therizinosaur frontals?</b>- Sues (1978) identified frontal
CMN 12349 as <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
and frontal CMN 12355 as Theropoda indet., although note his plates 7
and 8 are switched so that they are given each others' captions. Currie
(1987b) accepted CMN 12349 as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>,
but with regard to CMN 12355 stated that
"comparison with Mongolian specimens suggests that it may represent <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span> (Currie, in
preparation)."  Currie (1992) again stated CMN 12355 "may
represent the segnosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlicosaurus</span>"
(although note that as in Sues' paper it is mislabeled 12349 in his
Figure 2) and also referred TMP 1981.016.0231 to Segnosauridae. 
Currie
(2005) listed CMN 12349 as a tentative "therizinosauroid similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>", but figured CMN
12355 so probably meant that specimen.  Indeed, it seems CMN 12349
was correctly identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dromaeosaurus</span>
in the first place as it is similar to the holotype and has only been
referred to Therizinosauroidea accidentally due to Sues' original plate
caption mistake.  Larson et al. (2014) performed a morphometric
analysis of Dinosaur Park coelurosaur frontals, and found that CMN
12355 grouped with <i>Troodon</i>, so is troodontid instead. Yet
without including a therizinosaur such as <i>Erlikosaurus</i>
itself, the study only had so much explanatory power.  More
recently,
Cullen et al. (2020) expanded the analysis to include both <span style="font-style: italic;">Erlikosaurus</span>
and
the Bissekty therizinosaurid, still recovering CMN 12355 within the
Dinosaur Park troodontid range and far from therizinosaurids. 
Both it
and the less complete TMP 1981.016.0231 are here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon formosus</span> sensu lato.<br>
<b>Reinterpreted records</b>- The supposed <i>Struthiomimus</i> manual
ungual in plate XV figure 10-11 of Lambe (1902) is not ornithomimid and
may be a <i>Troodon</i> pedal ungual II instead. Found with this and
apparently similar unguals and manual phalanges were an astragalus,
calcaneum, pedal phalanges and two elements identified by Lambe as
distal ends of metacarpal I and metatarsal I. A metatarsal I would
exclude ornithomimids from consideration, but a calcaneum would exclude
troodontids. It's probable some material was incorrectly associated or
misidentified. Though Britt (1993) described the posterior cervical
vertebrae RTMP 81.37.15 and 92.36.1212 as ornithomimids, Makovicky
(1995) indicated they were actually <i>Troodon</i>. <br>
Although Currie et al. (1990) reported <i>Troodon</i> from the Milk
River Formation, Baszio (1997) notes the ROM specimens noted were
collected in the Milk Creek area, but probably in the Judith River
Group. A large sample of theropod teeth from the Milk River Formation
did not include <i>Troodon</i>.<br>
Rowe et al. (1992) and Sankey (1997, 1998) identified <i>Troodon</i>
in the Aguja Formation of Texas based on teeth (TMM 43057-323 and LSUMG
140:6117 respectively), but these were later identified as
pachycephalosaurian by Sankey (2001). This would mean <i>Troodon</i>
is unknown from the Aguja Formation, except that Montellano et al.
(2009) later reported cf. <i>Troodon</i> teeth in an abstract. Whether
these are truly troodontid awaits proper description.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><strong>Other diagnoses</strong></span>- (after
Carpenter, 1982) crowns of teeth strongly compressed labiolingually and
recurved; mesial margin without serrations or sharp, translucent
carina; mesial edge usually rounded, but may have low, blunt, opaque
carina; distal margin with large serrations having translucent edges;
serrations largest in middle, and may be subequal to crown's tip in
size; distal serrations perpendicular to vertical axis of tooth; crown
tip directed distally, almost parallel to crown base; crown tip does
not function as a piercing tip, but as first serration; first
definitive serration occurs immediately below crown tip and differs
from other deinonychosaurs in that it is not significantly smaller than
crown tip; near tooth's base, two small serrations are crowded
together; FABL of tooth almost equal to height.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Estes (1964) referred teeth to <i>Saurornithoides sp.</i>,
but these seem to belong to a different species of troodontid (cf.
Troodontidae indet. of Sankey et al., 2002). Carpenter (1982) described
several teeth as <i>Pectinodon bakkeri</i>, believing them to be
distinct from Judith River troodontids, though Currie showed this was
due to their position in the jaw (posterior dentary). Virtually no
Lance Formation troodontid material has been described except this
material, which Currie (1987) felt was indistinguishable from Judith
River <i>Troodon</i>, though Currie et al. (1990) stated they were
somewhat different. Derstler (1995) considered his juvenile material
and eggshells to belong to a new taxon of troodontid. Brownstein (2024) described YPM 4691 found in 1890 in Niobrara County, Wyoming (cf. <em>Saurornithoides</em> in the YMP online catalog) as Troodontinae indet..&nbsp; He claims it is &quot;not referable to ... †<em>Pectinodon</em>, which lacks strongly apically-hooked distal denticles and does not have a strongly recurved main body&quot;, but YPM 4691 also lacks hooked distal serrations and curvature could easily be positionally variable.&nbsp; It is referred to <em>bakkeri</em> here instead of Sankey et al.'s cf. Troodontidae indeterminate Genus and species indeterminate A because it lacks longitudinal ridges and has pointed serrations. Olshevsky (1991)
created the new combination <i>Troodon bakkeri</i> for Lance Formation
troodontid teeth, which is used here because the basal tubera are large
and the dentary symphysis seems more robust than <i>Zanabazar</i>,
though not as much as in <i>T. formosus</i> (due to ontogeny?).

<b>Comments</b>- The two braincases were described as <i>T. formosus</i>,
apparently identical to that species except for some pneumatic
features, which are known to exhibit marked individual and symmetry
variation. These teeth have not been described in detail, though Currie
et al. (1990) noted they were somewhat different than Judith River <i>Troodon</i>
teeth, and Sankey et al. (2002) said that no examples of their cf.
Troodontidae indet. were present in this formation. Fiorillo (2008)
found the teeth to be larger on average than <i>T. formosus</i> (9.78
mm in length vs. 4.96 mm), but indentical in length vs. FABL. The
Alaskan teeth range from 5.4-14.3 mm in length and 4.3-9 mm in FABL.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Currie (1987) described a dentary with teeth that can
be referred to <i>Troodon</i> because of its extensive mandibular
symphysis. Although Currie et al. (1990) state Horseshoe Canyon
Formation teeth are essentially identical to Judith River teeth, Baszio
(1997) notes they are are generally smaller than Dinosaur Park (Judith
River) <i>T. formosus</i>, but identical in morphology. Ryan et al.
(1998) state they could not distinguish Horseshoe Canyon teeth from
Judith River teeth, but referred to the former as <i>Troodon sp.</i>
due to the stratigraphic difference. Similarly, Torices et al. (2014)
could not distinguish Horseshoe Canyon and Dinosaur Park teeth
statistically. However, Larson and Currie (2013) found "troodontid
teeth from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation are distinct from the
Dinosaur Park Formation teeth." Morhardt et al. (2013) examined
Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine braincases and found "two distinct
morphologies associated with the occipital sinus, in one case being
'peaked' (dorsally extended, mediolaterally compressed) and the other
case being 'rounded' (dorsal surface gently curves, shows no dorsal
extension, and is not mediolaterally compressed)." The peaked
morphology was said to be more similar to <i>Zanabazar</i>. Most
recently, Evans et al. (2017) found Dinosaur Park and Judith River
teeth largely overlapped the morphospace of Horseshoe Canyon teeth,
though the spaces that ignore the 5% of outliers have a more limited
degree of overlap. They also agreed with Currie that Dinosaur Park and
Horseshoe Canyon dentaries cannot be distinguished, but described two
Horseshoe Canyon frontals as the types of their new taxon <i>Albertavenator
curriei</i> based on several difference from Dinosaur Park frontals.
Discovered in 1993, the holotype was listed along with the paratype as <i>Troodon
formosus</i> elements by Eberth et al. (2013). The lack of any
associated specimens means that only the frontals can be confidently
assigned to <i>Albertavenator</i>, as it is possible multiple
troodontid taxa coexisted in the formation.<br>

intercondylar bridge of astragalus hyperconstricted; proximal groove
separating astragalar body and ascending process craniocaudally wide
and v-shaped; cranioproximal groove on astragalar condyles absent;
astragalar condyles subequal in cranial extent; shaft of metatarsal II
markedly compressed (midshaft length-to-transverse width ratio 38.8);
metatarsal III distally ginglymoid; pronounced, rounded tab on
dorsolateral aspect of metatarsal III proximal to distal condyle;
distal corner of lateral collateral ligament pit on metatarsal IV with
small protuberance, creating rounded depression between extensor
aspects of distal condyles.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 2008 and initially announced by Zanno et
al. (2009). The holotype was included in a version of Norell et al.'s
2000 troodontid analysis and found to be at least as derived as <i>Byronosaurus</i>.<br>
Parrish and Eaton (1991) list troodontid remains, which Hutchison et
al. (1997) lists as <span style="font-style: italic;">Troodon</span>
sp..  The partial skeleton UCMP 149171 was discovered in 1994.
Zanno et al. (2009) mistakenly cite it as UCMP 143270, which is a <i>Parasaurolophus</i>
specimen. Zanno et al. (2011) briefly describe the remains and note
they may be referrable to the contemporaneous <i>Talos</i>. 
Zanno (2007) first mentioned UMNH VP 16303 as a taxon distinct from <i>Troodon</i>,
though it was later relegated to Troodontidae indet..  Evans et
al. (2017) find it to be outside the range of variation of Dinosaur
Park frontals (<span style="font-style: italic;">Latenivenatrix</span>/<i>Stenonychosaurus</i>)
and distant from <i>Albertavenator</i>
from the Hoseshoe Canyon Formation as well.  The tooth UMNH VP
12507
has large distal serrations (12) and no mesial serrations.<br>
