<b>Ex-Tyrannosauroidea</b>- Lapparent (1960) suggested <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>
was more closely related to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> than to
megalosaurids/allosaurids, which has been suggested by several other
authors since (Paul, 1988; Kurzanov, 1989; Molnar et al., 1990), though
it is now recognized as a carnosaur (Sereno et al., 1996). Kurzanov
also felt that <i>Diplotomodon</i> was a relative of <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>,
though it has not been restudied recently and is Theropoda indet. on
this site. It was however listed as Tyrannosauroidea indet. by Holtz
(2004) without comment.<br>
When he named it, Walker (1964) included several taxa in
Tyrannosauroidea that are not currently assigned to that clade. <i>Ornithosuchus</i>
and <i>Teratosaurus</i> are crurotarsans (Sereno and Arcucci, 1990;
Galton, 1985), while <i>Sinosaurus</i> is supposedly a synonym of <i>"Dilophosaurus"
sinensis</i> (Currie et al., in prep.). <i>Indosuchus</i> was assigned
to Tyrannosauridae, which was followed by most later authors (e.g.
Chatterjee, 1978) until Bonaparte et al. (1990) determined it is an
abelisaurid. Walker also referred Spinosauridae to his
Tyrannosauroidea, but <i>Spinosaurus</i> is a megalosauroid basal
tetanurine (Sereno et al., 1994) and <i>Becklespinax</i> (= <i>Altispinax</i>
of Walker) is a carnosaur (Naish, 1999). <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i> was
often thought to be intermediate between <i>Allosaurus</i> and
tyrannosaurids (Walker, 1964; Paul, 1988; Kurzanov, 1989; Bakker et
al., 1988), though since being included in cladistic analyses it is
recognized as a carnosaur (e.g. Holtz, 1994).<br>
Ornithomimosaur postcrania are often confused with tyrannosauroids.
This includes numerous Bissekty elements generally referred to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>
by Nessov (1995), but reidentified by Carr (2005) and Sues and
Averianov (2015) - manual ungual CCMGE 431/12457, femora including
CCMGE 479/12457 and 724/12457, a tibia, astragali including CCMGE
447/12457 and 448/12457, metatarsals and pedal unguals CCMGE 609/12457
and 610/12457.<br>
Eudromaeosaur cranial elements are sometimes confused with
tyrannosauroids. <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> itself was first believed to be
a tyrannosaurid (as a deinodontid) by Matthew and Brown (1922). A more
controversial taxon is <i>Itemirus</i>, which Kurzanov (1976) placed
sister to Tyrannosauridae, echoing its placement in Tyrannosauroidea by
Holtz (2004) and Miyashita (2011). Yet Sues and Averianov (2014)
redescribe it as a dromaeosaurid. Nessov (1995) listed the Bissekty
maxillary fragment CCMGE 600/12457 as tyrannosaurid, but Sues and
Averianov refer it to <i>Itemirus</i>. <br>
Chatterjee (1985) described <i>Postosuchus</i> and poposaurids as
tyrannosaurid ancestors. They are now recognized as crurotarsans, with
tyrannosaurids being more closely related to allosaurids than to any
Triassic taxon.<br>
Paul (1988) placed several taxa closer to tyrannosaurids than to <i>Allosaurus</i>
in his paraphyletic Allosauridae, which would be defined as
tyrannosauroids using the current definition. Besides <i>Acrocanthosaurus</i>
and <i>Indosuchus</i>, he also included <i>Chilantaisaurus </i> (a
more basal avetheropod, even if megaraptorans are placed in
Tyrannosauroidea- e.g. Novas et al., 2013) and <i>Shaochilong </i>(his
<i>Chilantaisaurus maortuensis</i>; which is now considered to be a
carcharodontosaurid- Brusatte et al., 2009). Molnar et al. (1990)
thought these might be tyrannosauroids too, as did Chure (2000) and
Holtz (2004) for <i>Shaochilong</i> but not <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>.
Paul also thought <i>Labocania</i> was close to tyrannosaurids, which
is followed by some recent references such as Holtz (2004) as well. It
is tentatively placed as a carcharodontosaurid here. Besides Paul,
Kurzanov (1989) and Molnar et al. (1990) tentatively placed <i>Bahariasaurus</i>
close to tyrannosaurid ancestry, while Chure (2000) assigned it to
Tyrannosauridae. While its position within Orionides is currently
unresolved, the tyrannosauroid characters suggested by these authors
are invalid (see entry). Paul also suggested <i>Erectopus</i> was
close to tyrannosaurids, but is is more probably a carnosaur (Allain,
2002). Finally, Paul placed <i>Indosaurus</i> in a similar position,
but this is an abelisaurid like <i>Indosuchus</i> (Bonaparte et al.,
1990). <br>
Several taxa have recently been placed in Tyrannosauroidea, but are
here assigned to other coelurosaur groups. Olshevsky (1995) classified <i>Compsognathus</i>
as a 'tyrannosaurian', largely based on the supposedly didactyl manus.
While compsognathids are similar to some possible basal tyrannosauroids
like <i>Dilong</i>, they are more parsimoniously closer to birds.
Buffetaut et al. (1996) originally assigned <i>Siamotyrannus</i> to
Tyrannosauroidea, but is is more probably a carnosaur (Pharris, DML
1997; Rauhut, 2000). Holtz (2004) assigned <i>Santanaraptor</i> to
Tyrannosauroidea tentatively, and it emerged as a tyrannosauroid more
derived than proceratosaurids and <i>Dilong</i> in Novas et al.'s
(2013) and Porfiri et al.'s (2014) analyses, though it ends up in basal
Maniraptora in Dal Sasso and Maganuco (2011).  It is assigned to
Compsognathidae here.  "Tonouchisaurus" was stated to be a
tyrannosauroid by the press, but has not been described yet and may be
another variety of tyrannoraptoran. <i>Coelurus</i> and <i>Tanycolagreus</i>
were both found to be basal tyrannosauroids by Senter (2007), and the
latter was by Porfiri et al. (2014), but may be maniraptoromorphs
instead. <i>Bagaraatan</i> was found to be the basalmost
tyrannosauroid by Holtz (2004), and Carr (2005) found it to be sister
to <i>Bistahieversor</i>, but it may be maniraptoromorph as in Rauhut
(2000) as well or a chimaera of both clades. Megaraptorans (excluding <i>Chilantaisaurus</i>
and <i>Siats</i>) were found to be coelurosaurs in the analysis of
Novas et al. (2013) and that of Porfiri et al. (2014) which included
the new evidence of <i>Megaraptor</i>'s <i>Dilong</i>-like skull. <br>
<b>Tyrannosauroidea</b> <b>defined</b>- Sereno et al.'s (2009)
definition is a revision of Holtz's (2004), substituting <i>Ornithomimus
edmontonicus</i> for <i>O. velox</i>, <i>Velociraptor</i> for <i>Deinonychus</i>,
and <i>Troodon</i> for <i>Allosaurus</i>. <i>Ornithomimus velox</i>
is the better ornithomimosaur specifier, as discussed under
Maniraptoriformes. Being the namesake of Deinonychosauria, <i>Deinonychus</i>
is a better specifier than <i>Velociraptor</i>, but <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
might be better than either due to its priority. Still, I have no
problem with <i>Deinonychus</i>. Replacing <i>Allosaurus</i> with <i>Troodon</i>
was a bad choice, since numerous topologies have had allosaurids sister
to tyrannosaurids but none I'm aware of have had troodontids sister to
tyrannosaurids. The only other taxa that have been suggested to be
sister to tyrannosauroids are spinosaurids (Walker, 1964),
carcharodontosaurids (Paul, 1988; Kurzanov, 1989; Molnar et al., 1990)
and compsognathids (Olshevsky, 1995), but the former was explicitly
placed in Tyrannosauroidea and I don't see placing the others in
Tyrannosauroidea as counter-intuitive.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Rauhut (2000) illustrated and briefly described the
holotype ilium as <i>Stokesosaurus</i> sp., before it was described as
a new genus by Rauhut (2003). <br>
Brusatte and Carr (2016) recovered <i>Aviatyrannis</i> as the most
basal pantyrannosaurian in their Bayesian analysis, though its
exclusion from the <i>Dilong</i>+<i>Tyrannosaurus</i> clade is only
supported by 61% posterior probability. Exclusion from <i>Stokesosaurus</i>+<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
is strong (90%), and from <i>Xiongguanlong</i>+<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
fairly certain (100%).  <br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Is <span style="font-style: italic;">Aviatyrannis</span>
an ornithomimosaur?</span> Hattori et al. (2023) suggested "Because the
ilium of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span> is
strikingly similar to the holotypic ilium of <span style="font-style: italic;">Aviatyrannis</span>
..., its purported affinity to a tyrannosauroid is tested here against
an alternative hypothesis that it in fact belongs an
ornithomimosaur."  Examination of the matrix shows <span style="font-style: italic;">Aviatyrannis</span>
was scored as different than other tyrannosauroids in- character 425-0
("Ventral_edge_of_anterior_ala_of_ilium_ straight_or_gently_curved"),
while it is actually hooked more than e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span> and the un-included <span style="font-style: italic;">Stokesosaurus</span>; 435-1
("Brevis_fossa_shape
deeply_concave,_expanded_posteriorly_with_lateral_overhang"), which is
also true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Stokesosaurus</span>
and probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Juratyrant</span>,
although the latter is crushed so that any posterior expansion was
lost.  Finally, Hattori et al. say "Although the dorsal half of
the anterior margin is concave in <span style="font-style: italic;">Aviatyrannis</span>,
it is much shallower than the notch seen in tyrannosauroids.  In
addition, while some ornithomimosaurs lack the concavity on the
anterior margin, many ornithomimosaurs do not have the corresponding
portions preserved, so the conditions of these species remain unknown",
but the presence of a concavity is still a character and the fact some
ornithomimosaurs can't be scored in no way argues they might have the
tyrannosauroid condition as well.  Thus misscorings led to the
placement of <span style="font-style: italic;">Aviatyrannis</span>
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span> in
Choiniere's coelurosaur matrix as recovered by Hattori et al., and
adding it (ilium only) and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannomimus</span>
to Hartman et al.'s maniraptoromorph matrix results in a tyrannosauroid
placement with an ornithomimosaur placement being two steps longer.<br>

in having a proximally extensive raised dorsal condyle and in being
more slender. It is here referred to Tyrannosauroidea.<br>

(Bainsheire Formation, Cenomanian-Lower Cenon) there isa small
ungual phalanx of the first manual digit, quite typical for
tyrannosaurids."  Perle (1977) referred this material to <i>Alectrosaurus
olseni</i>, which has been generally followed in the literature. Holtz
(2001) found that it was the sister taxon to <i>A. olseni</i> in an
unpublished cladistic analysis. Carr (2005) found it differs from <i>Alectrosaurus</i>
in a few features- hypertrophied manual flexor tubercles, the entire
distal end of metatarsal III is widened relative to the rest of the
bone, and metatarsal III is apomorphically pinched out for half its
length posterior to metatarsals II and IV. He finds no reason to refer
the specimens to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>. Restudy of the material is
clearly necessary. <br>

discovered in late Spring 1941, part of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Chienkosaurus ceratosauroides</span> type
consisting of four isolated teeth IVPP V237A-D.  Young's (1942)
diagnosis was "Mainly based upon" the largest tooth (V237A), with the
three smaller teeth considered immature and (possibly incorrectly)
lacking their bases.  Dong et al. (1983) stated "during the
editing of "The Handbook of Chinese Fossil
Vertebrates," Zhiming Dong conducted a review of these four specimens
and formally confirmed that the best preserved tooth among the V237
collection was a premaxillary tooth of a carnosaurian dinosaur, but
that the remaining three teeth were assignable to the crocodile <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>."  The dentition
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
has not been described or figured in enough detail to distinguish it
from theropods, but two of the teeth (IVPP V237B and V237D)
are similar in being short and barely recurved with a high crown base
ratio, characters shared with the tooth figured separately in
<span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>' type
description.  They are provisionally placed in <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
sp. here.  The third supposed <span style="font-style: italic;">Hsisosuchus</span>
tooth (IVPP V237C) is
different in having a distinctly D-shaped section with strong carinae
somewhat like Guimarota tyrannosauroid premaxillary tooth IPFUB GUI D
89, so is provisionally placed in Tyrannosauroidea here.<br>
Young placed locality 47 at "the top part of the Kuangyuan Series and
immediately below the Chentsianyen conglomerate", now known as the
Guangyuan Group and the Chengqiangyan Group, with the former
corresponding to the Xiashaximiao Formation through the Penglaizhen
Formation.  As it was found "immediately below" the boundary, IVPP
V237 may be from the Penglaizhen Formation or slightly lower
Shuining Formation.  The age is listed as Tithonian on fossilworks
and in Weishampel (1990), the latter cited as from "Dong (pers.
comm.)".  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (modified from Xu et al., 2006) distinct opening on
the maxilla close to the premaxilla-maxilla contact; complex, highly
pneumatic nasal crest; low, rugose ridge along the midline of the
frontals; dorsally flattened parietal with two parallel sagittal
crests; transverse ridge within the supratemporal fossa;
centropostzygapophyseal lamina on cervicodorsal vertebrae with its
dorsal end expanding laterally; deep, longitudinal sulci on dorsal
surfaces of the distal caudal vertebrae; ventral part of scapular blade
with sub-equilateral triangular cross-section and thick posterior
margin; metacarpal II with prominent medioventral and laterodorsal
processes proximally; manual phalanx II-2 with prominent medioventral
process proximally; femoral greater trochanter much narrower
anteroposteriorly than the lesser trochanter; distinct fossa on
posterodistal surfaces of astragalus and calcaneum; pedal phalanx II-1
with prominent paired ventral processes proximally (also in <i>Aorun</i>).<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Choiniere (2010) noted the "deep and narrow
groove along the anterior margin of the premaxilla" listed by Xu et al.
is also found in <i>Proceratosaurus</i> and <i>Eotyrannus</i>.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 2002, this is probably the medium-sized
"basal tetanuran" represented by "articulated specimens and a juvenile
skull" noted by Clark et al. (2004). Xu et al. (2006) announced <i>Guanlong</i>
and briefly described the taxon, while the paratype skull and holotype
specimen were described in detail by Choiniere (2010). <br>
Carr (2006) found <i>Guanlong</i> to be sister to <i>Monolophosaurus</i>
within Carnosauria in an unpublished analysis. They were sister taxa
based on the shape of the anterior maxillary process, tall pneumatic,
fenestrate sagittal cranial crest, and obturator foramen in the
ischium. While Carr also noted many characters which differ between the
genera, he suggested these may be ontogenetic, as the taxa are from the
same geological unit. However, all other analyses find the taxa to be
separated, with <i>Guanlong</i> either a basal tyrannosauroid or
slightly closer to birds.<br>

<b>Holotype</b>- (NHMUK R4860) partial skull (~290 mm), mandibles (one
incomplete; 260 mm), hyoid (110 mm), two cervical rib fragments<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Rauhut and Milner, 2008) dorsal process of the
premaxilla inclined slightly anterodorsally and nasal horn core
overhanging the premaxillary internarial bar anteriorly; internarial
bar of the premaxilla bifurcating posteriorly into a posteriorly
directed ramus and a dorsally directed ramus; anterior end of the
maxillary antorbital fossa placed considerably anterior and ventral to
the promaxillary fenestra; anteriormost dentary tooth curved anteriorly
and with the carinae oriented labiolingually.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Woodward (1902) named and described the species in
1910 as <i>Megalosaurus bradleyi</i>. It was placed in <i>Megalosaurus</i>
as it has four premaxillary teeth, unlike <i>Ceratosaurus</i> - the
other 'megalosaurid' mentioned by Woodward. Huene (1926) thought that
this species was most closely related to <i>Ceratosaurus</i> because
of the nasal crest and therefore separated it from <i>Megalosaurus</i>
as <i>Proceratosaurus bradleyi</i>. He distinguished it from <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
by the greater amount of premaxillary and maxillary teeth, as well as
labially fluted premaxillary teeth. He distinguished it from
'megalosaurs' (<i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Eustreptospondylus</i> and <i>Allosaurus</i>)
by the shape of the external naris, the shape and breadth of the dorsal
maxillary process, the height of the antorbital fenestra and the lower
mandibular joint. Huene (1926) later formalized the relationship
between <i>Proceratosaurus</i> and <i>Ceratosaurus</i> by placing
them both in the Ceratosauridae. Paul (1988) was the first to suggest <i>Proceratosaurus</i>
is a coelurosaur, specifically related to <i>Ornitholestes</i> in
Ornitholestinae within the Allosauridae. This was based on their
procumbant anterior dentary teeth, conical anterior teeth (both common
in basal coelurosaurs), small anterior teeth and nasal horn (both not
present in <i>Ornitholestes</i>). Holtz (2000) recovered <i>Proceratosaurus</i>
as a coelurosaur more basal than <i>Ornitholestes</i>, though he later
(Holtz, 2001; Holtz et al., 2004) recovered it as a sister taxon of <i>Ornitholestes</i>.
Rauhut (2003) recovered it as the most basal coelurosaur however. Naish
(online, 2006) noted his unpublished thesis finds <i>Proceratosaurus</i>
to be a basal tyrannosauroid. Rauhut and Milner (2008) restudied the
skull and referred <i>Proceratosaurus</i> to Tyrannosauroidea based
on- short premaxilla; well-developed jugal recess; steeply sloping
basisphenoid; premaxillary teeth that are considerably smaller than the
maxillary teeth; D-shaped anteriormost premaxillary teeth. This was
expanded on in Rauhut et al. (2010).<br>

projecting orbital process in the area of the junction between the
frontal and jugal processes of the postorbital; large concavity on the
lateral surface of the main body of the postorbital; external
mandibular fenestra located mostly within the surangular.<br>
differs from <i>Sinotyrannus</i> in- morphologically lateral surface
of the maxillary process of the premaxilla faces dorsally; maxilla

<b>Comments</b>- Lydekker named this taxon <i>Calamospondylus</i>
without realizing Fox had previously used the name for a different
specimen (<i>Calamospondylus oweni</i>). It cannot be compared with <i>Calamospondylus</i>
or <i>Aristosuchus</i>, so synonymy with either is inappropriate.
Naish (online, 2006; Naish and Martill, 2007; 2011) correctly realized <i>Calamosaurus</i>'
cervicals are extremely similar to <i>Dilong</i>'s, suggesting it's
also a tyrannosauroid. In a 2004 DML post, Naish also states "there are
presently three soon-to-appear papers on <i>Calamosaurus</i> and its
referred material." Two may be his 2011 theropod chapter and/or 2007
British saurischian review with Martill, but another is a short paper
detailing the similarity between <i>Calamosaurus</i> and <i>Dilong</i>
(Naish, online 2006) which remains unpublished. A cervical centrum
donated to the IWCMS collections in 2015 seems referrable to <i>Calamosaurus</i>
(Isle of Wight Council, 2015), but has yet to be described.<br>
The tibia (NHMUK R186) often referred to this species cannot come from
the holotype individual due to size disparity and is not comparable to
the holotype in any case (Naish et al., 2001), though it may be an
ornithomimosaur (Allain et al., 2014). Naish (DML, 2002) reported a new
specimen referred to <i>Calamosaurus</i>, which has since been placed
on display at the Dinosaur Expeditions Centre (cast UOP-C002-2004). It
consists of a dorsal vertebra, distal tibia and proximal metatarsal
(Mattsson, pers. comm. 2015), which are undescribed. The tibia was
figured by Naish (2011) and said to be "morphologically identical" to
NHMUK R186, so is listed with that specimen here. A second undescribed
specimen referred to <i>Calamosaurus</i> was discovered in 2014 and is
also on display there (Mattsson, pers. comm. 2015). Based on apparent
similarity between the tibiae of the 2002 and 2014 specimens, they are
listed in the same entry here.<br>

illustrated and described a <i>Dilong</i>

The figure is probably correct, as the metatarsus in IVPP V11579 is
articulated differently.  The endocast was described by Brusatte
et al. (2016), and published in detail as Kundrát et al. (2020).<br>
While many cladistic analyses have found this to be a basal

birds. <br>

? material (Delair, 1959; Benton and Spencer, 1995)<br>
<b>Description</b>- Initial comparisons are to dromaeosaurids, as
Milner (1999, 2002) proposed <i>Nuthetes</i> was a member of this
clade. The holotype anterior dentary fragment suggests a cranial length
of ~250 mm, and a total length of 2.3 meters, scaling from <i>Deinonychus</i>.
<br>
The dentary has an upper row of foramina, like dromaeosaurids and most
other theropods, which are circular anteriorly (unlike <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>).
A lower row seems to be absent, replaced by a groove that runs
posterodorsally until fading around the seventh tooth. This seems
unique within dromaeosaurids. Separate interdental plates are present,
like <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> (in the anterior dentary at least) and <i>Bambiraptor</i>.
The symphysis is represented by horizontal striations. The Mackelian
groove is reduced to a poorly defined shallow depression terminating at
the fifth tooth, with a foramen directly anterior. In <i>Deinonychus</i>
and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, the groove is shallow but well defined
and the foramen located at the third or fourth tooth. <i>Velociraptor</i>'s
looks similar, but may end a bit more posteriorly, while <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>'
ends more anteriorly, at the second tooth or so. <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>'
extends to the third tooth, but is deep and narrow.<br>
Teeth (numbering &gt;9) are typically theropod in several respects;
they are laterally compressed, recurved and serrated. The tip of some
(all?) recurved teeth is located posterior to the alveolar edge, which
is seen in dromaeosaurids. Milner reports the extent of serration on
mesial carinae varies from the apical third to the whole crown, while
the distal serrations are restricted to the apical half when present at
all. I'm unaware of this occurring in any other theropod, as most lose
their mesial serrations before their distal ones. And indeed one can
see in plate 1 (6, 10) that distal serrations extend to the base of the
crown in at least some teeth. Thus, I think Milner confused mesial and
distal a few times in the text. What I suspect is really the case is
that the mesial carinae are serrated for up to half their length
(sometimes unserrated) while the distal carinae are completely
serrated. This is similar to "velociraptorines" and <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>,
but distinct from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> (whch seemingly always has
serrated mesial carinae) and <i>Tsaagan</i>, <i>Microraptor</i> and <i>Cryptovolans</i>
(which lack mesial serrations). Heterodonty is observed, as 40% of the
teeth are longer and more slender than the rest. This seems more
developed than in <i>Saurornitholestes</i>. Constriction between the
crown and root is comparable to <i>Saurornitholestes</i>, so is much
less than in <i>Microraptor</i>. The DSDI varies from 1.14 to 1.55,
which is almost identical to <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> (1.13-1.43),
larger than dromaeosaurines (.81-1.18) and comparable to the low end of
"velociraptorines" (1.19-2.33). Serrations are smaller than in most
dromaeosaurids (4.5-8/mm compared to 2.5-2.8/mm in <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
2.4-2.6/mm in <i>Utahraptor</i>, 4-5/mm in <i>Saurornitholestes</i>,
3.2-3.6/mm in <i>Deinonychus</i>, 5/mm in <i>Bambiraptor</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i>;
3-3.6/mm in <i>Achillobator</i>) except for <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
and <i>Microraptor</i>, which have 7-14/mm and 8/mm respectively.
Serrations have blunt rounded tips, unlike in "velociraptorine" and
some anterior <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> teeth. Dromaeosaurines, <i>Microraptor</i>
and most <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> teeth share this plesiomorphy with <i>Nuthetes</i>.
Some serrations are asymmetrical, being almost hooked apically. <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>
has only perpendicular serrations, while "velociraptorines'" and <i>Microraptor</i>'s
are hooked. <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> shows similar variation to <i>Nuthetes</i>.<br>
A premaxillary tooth is said to be serrated only mesially, which is
also seen in the first premaxillary tooth of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>'
holotype. However, Milner could have reversed the terms again and the
distal carina may be the serrated one. In any case, <i>Deinonychus</i>,
<i>Dromaeosaurus</i> and probably <i>Utahraptor</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
differ in having both carinae serrated on premaxillary teeth. Most of <i>Sinornithosaurus</i>'
anterior teeth are unserrated (as is reported for <i>Microraptor</i>),
except for a few serrations on the first one, as mentioned above. The
tooth is said to be D-shaped, but dromaeosaurines are often said to
exhibit this condition as well, though it is quite different from the
tyrannosauroid morphology. This tooth has a few strange characters as
well- the enamel is striated, some serrations have a lingual midline
ridge, and others have been combined in labial view. <br>

this taxon as a lizard, tentatively referring the tibia and fibula
DORCM G 914 to <i>Nuthetes</i> as well (later referred to the
atoposaurid crocodilian <i>Theriosuchus</i> by Seeley in 1893). Owen
later (1879) identified <i>Nuthetes</i> as a crocodilian and referred
additional teeth to the taxon, as well as dermal armor called
granicones. <i>Nuthetes</i> was first identified as a dinosaur by
Lydekker (1888), and as a theropod by Zittel (1911), who placed it in
the Coeluridae. Swinton (1934) and Chakravarti (1935) referred it to
the Megalosauridae. It was even synonymized with <i>Megalosaurus</i>
itself by Romer (1956). Delair (1959) believed the granicones to be
from a thyreophoran, and Galton (1986) referred them to <i>Echinodon</i>
(now recognized as a heterodontosaurid). They have been recently
reidentified as solemydid turtle limb and tail(?) scutes (Barrett et
al., 2002). Though most often viewed as a lizard or juvenile
megalosauroid or carnosaur last century, <i>Nuthetes</i> was
reidentified as a juvenile dromaeosaurid by Milner (1999, 2002). Bonde
(2012) thought three larger teeth (including NHMUK R 15870 and 15878)
were probably congeneric with <i>Dromaeosauroides</i>, while <i>Nuthetes</i>
itself could be "a more generalized tetanuran/neotheropod."<br>
Milner assigns <i>Nuthetes</i> to the Dromaeosauridae based solely on
the high DSDI, though she also compares the Mackelian groove and
posterior extent of tooth tips to <i>Deinonychus</i>. She
distinguishes it from "velociraptorines" by the absence of apically
inclined serrations, despite the fact she earlier describes and
illustrates these in the taxon. Although Milner says dromaeosaurines
are distinguished from Nuthetes by their low DSDI and that <i>Nuthetes</i>
compares most closely to "velociraptorines", she never actually assigns
it to the Velociraptorinae. No comparison or mention is made to
non-dromaeosaurid dromaeosaurs.<br>
Other taxa besides "velociraptorines" have high DSDI's however. Within
coelurosaurs, these include basal tyrannosauroids (<i>Guanlong, Dilong,
Eotyrannus</i>) and <i>Richardoestesia</i>. <br>
That <i>Richardoestesia</i> is not discussed by Milner is confusing,
as she lists it in her table of DSDI values as having a range almost
identical to <i>Nuthetes</i> (1.06-1.53). <i>Richardoestesia</i> <i>gilmorei</i>
has a Mackelian groove that is shallow like dromaeosaurids and an upper
row of circular foramina. Further details are difficult to make out,
though an anterior foramen may be present. It also has unfused
interdental plates like <i>Nuthetes</i>. Notably, <i>R. gilmorei</i>
exhibits similar heterodonty, with some teeth being quite elongate and
others being shorter. And like dromaeosaurids, at least some teeth have
tips extending posterior to their distal base. <i>Nuthetes</i> falls
within the range of <i>R. gilmorei</i> for labiolingual thickness vs.
FABL, height vs. FABL. Serration morphology is similar, with blunt
rounded tips slightly hooked apically. <i>Richardoestesia</i> also has
mesial serrations that vary in extent down the carina, from extending
the complete crown edge to being absent. One of the characteristics of
the genus is the minute distal serration size (5-12/mm), and this
agrees with <i>Nuthetes</i> (4.5-8/mm). The tentatively identified
premaxillary tooth of <i>Richardoestesia</i> is only serrated on one
carina, with a cross section similar to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. Two
important differences are that <i>Nuthetes</i> has interdenticle slits
and has no significant basal constriction on lateral teeth. Also, <i>Nuthetes</i>
shows none of the elongate straight teeth with convex distoapical
margins known to exist in the anterior dentary of <i>Richardoestesia</i>,
nor the elongate "stacked banana" serrations seen mesially in some
teeth of that genus. Although <i>R. isosceles</i> is more similar in
that it lacks basal constriction, it is far less recurved than <i>Nuthetes</i>,
never as short as <i>Nuthetes</i> dentary teeth, has even smaller
interdenticle slits, and never has rounded or pointed serrations.<br>
<i>Eotyrannus</i> differs in having fused interdental plates and larger
serrations (2.6/mm), though its Mackelian groove is shallow. <i>Guanlong</i>
also has larger serrations (3.8/mm) and is said to have labiolingually
thick lateral teeth, unlike <i>Nuthetes</i>. <i>Dilong</i> is more
difficult to compare as it has been only preliminarily described. Its
dentary tooth apices do extend posterior to the distal base, it has
unfused interdental plates, its lateral teeth are highly compressed
labiolingually and lack basal constriction, heterodont in the dentary
at least, and have serrations which are rounded and sometimes
asymmetrical. The serrations are separated by interdenticle slits as in
<i>Nuthetes</i>. The premaxillary teeth are D-shaped, as described in <i>Nuthetes</i>,
though whether <i>Nuthetes</i>' premaxillary tooth is truly D-shaped
is uncertain as noted above. Unfortunately, the serration size, dentary
foramina and medial dentary morphology are still undescribed. <i>Nuthetes</i>
cannot be distinguished from <i>Dilong</i> from what is currently
described of the latter, but this this may change as more material is
discovered of <i>Nuthetes</i> and more is described on <i>Dilong</i>.
It is provisionally placed by <i>Dilong</i> here.<br>

Material</b>- (USNM 540720) two right dentary fragments (~10.6 mm
dorsovent along anterior dentigerous portion)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in 2010,
USNM 540720 is an interesting specimen, consisting of two
dentary fragments including portions of eight alveoli.  Unlike
allosauroids or eudromaeosaurs the interdental plates are widely
separated, so this is neither a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Acrocanthosaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinonychus</span>,
while the large alveoli present posteriorly at the point where the
Meckelian groove widens and shallows eliminates even a basal
ornithomimosaur like the <span style="font-style: italic;">grandis</span>
material.  Among other theropods expected in Early Cretaceous
North America, basal megaraptorans (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Siats</span>)
and troodontids should differ in having fused interdental plates, while
alvarezsaurs, therizinosaurs and oviraptorosaurs have much smaller
alveoli compared to dentary depth, and archaeopterygids and Early
Cretaceous avialans are much too small.  Among remaining taxa with
unfused interdental plates and full rows of relatively large dentary
teeth, <span style="font-style: italic;">Eotyrannus</span> has much
taller interdental plates that contact and a taller sub-Meckelian area,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Coelurus</span> has a taller
sub-Meckelian area, more dorsally placed paradental groove and is
concave ventrally, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Ornitholestes</span>
also differs in the latter two features; <span style="font-style: italic;">Compsognathus</span> has a taller
Meckelian groove and more dorsally placed paradental groove; and <span style="font-style: italic;">Fukuivenator</span>
has a taller sub-Meckelian area, more dorsally placed paradental groove
and a much more dorsoventrally expanded dentary posteriorly.  The
three most similar taxa are <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span>, all of similar size and
with ventrally placed paradental grooves.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Sinornithosaurus</span> differs in having
its paradental plates mostly fused except for the first four or five, <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span> has a deeper
Meckelian groove, and both of these have a taller sub-Meckelian
area.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Nuthetes</span>
uniquely matches the Arundel specimen in the very low paradental
groove, so it is tentatively assigned the same phylogenetic
identification here, although that genus is itself very similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span>
and telling basal tyrannosauroids from basal dromaeosaurids based on
mandibular remains is difficult at the best of times.  Notably,
teeth similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">Richardoestesia</span>
have been described from the Arundel (USNM 497748, 497749) with basal
lengths of 2-4 mm, which matches the ~4 mm long alveoli of USNM 540720.<br>

<b>Comments-</b> The ilium described by Foster and Chure (2000) may be <i>Aviatyrannis</i>.
Benson (2008) noted it differed from <i>Stokesosaurus</i> in having a
strictly vertical median ridge and a blade with a lower profile, so
referred it to Tyrannosauroidea indet.. The premaxilla UUVP 2999
originally referred to <i>Stokesosaurus</i> by Madsen (1974) was later
referred to <i>Tanycolagreus</i> (Carpenter et al., 2005), but Benson
feels it is more likely a ceratosaur. Benson also referred the caudal
vertebrae described by Brit (1991) and the braincase UUVP 2455
described by Chure and Madsen (1998) to Theropoda indet., though he
noted the vertebrae do not differ significantly from those of <i>S.
langhami</i>. Curtice and Wilhite (1996) noted that the middle caudal
described by Britt (BYUVP 5103) had since been reassigned by Britt to <i>Ceratosaurus</i>.
Nesbitt et al. (2009) noted a furcula described by Chure and Madsen
(1996) as Theropoda indet. may be <i>Stokesosaurus</i>, as it
resembles tyrannosauroids in being U-shaped with expanded epicleideal
processes. Loewen et al. (2012) noted Cleveland-Lloyd quarry materials
referrable to <i>Stokesosaurus</i> including a premaxilla, maxilla,
complete braincase, two ilia and two ischia. The ilia are probably the
holotype and paratype, but the ischia may be new as BYUVP 4862 are from
Dry Mesa. The premaxilla may be UUVP 2999 which is from
Cleveland-Lloyd, and the braincase could be UUVP 2455 from the
Cleveland-Lloyd except that that specimen is not complete, preserving
only the posteroventral portion. <br>

<b>Comments-</b> <i>Eotyrannus</i> was discovered in 1997 and was
first announced by Martill and Hutt in 1998 at the Dinosaur Society
conference "British Dinosaurs - Their Lifes and Times". A number of
names were suggested in popular press for the genus- "Gavinosaurus",
"Lengosaurus" and "Kittysaurus", though "Fusinasus" seems to have been
a serious consideration by the authors. After the preliminary
description by Hutt et al. (2001), it was monographed by Naish in his
2006 thesis. Naish and Martill (2007) provided new cranial and skeletal
reconstructions based on this. The monograph has been revised by Naish
and Cau, and is due for publication soon. <br>
Mattsson (pers. comm. 2015) informs me of an incomplete tibia nicknamed
'Glyn's tibia' which is tentatively referred to Eotyrannus. The
specimen is on display at the Dinosaur Expeditions Centre and is being
studied by Siebert.<br>
This is traditionally placed as a non-tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroid as
suggested by nearly all analyses, though a few place it slightly closer
to birds (e.g. Lee and Worthy, 2011). <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Zanno et al.,
2019) semicircular tuberosity on anteromedial femoral shaft originating
at distalmost extent of anterior trochanter; sinuous articular facet on
medial aspect of fourth metatarsal for contact with third metatarsal;

fourth metatarsal in distal view; distal articular surface of fourth
metatarsal exhibiting hypertrophied anterolateral aspect, confluent
with a deeply incised, striated extensor groove that grades
indistinctly into the lateral collateral ligament pit<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Kirkland and Parrish (1995) mentioned remains of
"tyrannosaurids represented by an aublysodontid; cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>", listed as "an early
tyrannosaurid" cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
sp. by Kirkland et al. (1997) and Cifelli et al. (1999). The latter
wrote "each theropod taxon is represented by isolated teeth" and that
"the faunal list for the Mussentuchit local fauna is based on more than
5,000 catalogued specimens in the collection of the OMNH." 
Regarding the Robison eggshell site, Fiorillo (1999) said "one small
tooth from this site (CM 71399) has both the anterior and posterior
carinae on the lingual side of the tooth. The top half of the tooth is
missing but the cross section of the tooth is decidedly
D-shaped."  From the OMNH's microvertebrate project, Kirkland et
al. (2016) figure six "tyrannosaurioid teeth, smallest tooth is a
diagnostic premaxillary tooth." Avrahami (2018; published as Avrahami
et al., 2018) described a series of microvertebrates from the Cliffs of
Insanity locality including tyrannosauroid premaxillary tooth NCSM
33276 found on July 25 2015.  Zanno et al. (2019) described
premaxillary tooth NCSM 33393 from the Suicide Hill locality as 
Tyrannosauroidea indet. alongside NCSM 33276 and noted the former has
an autapomorphic "deep, obliquely oriented groove incising the lingual
ridge."  This is lacking in NCSM 33276 and is undescribed in CM
71399 and not visible in the photographed OMNH premaxillary
tooth.  Notably no Mussentuchit lateral teeth have been described
as tyrannosauroid, but those photographed by Kirkland et al. match NCSM
33268 (~20 mm) from the Cliffs of Insanity site and Morphotype 1 of
Frederickson et al. (2018) (5-35 mm) in size.  Due to the presence
of the large basal coelurosaur <span style="font-style: italic;">Siats</span>
in the same formation however, these are not referred to
Tyrannosauroidea here.  Early referrals of these teeth to
Aublysodontidae and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
were probably due to the widespread view in the 1990s that these were
primitive tyrannosauroids with more slender teeth than tyrannosaurids
and lacking serrations on their premaxillary teeth.  The latter
feature has since been discovered to be variable in basal
tyrannosauroids (e.g. true in <span style="font-style: italic;">Yutyrannus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiongguanlong</span>) and
juvenile tyrannosaurids, while <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
has no convincingly referred dental remains.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Moros</span> is based on a hindlimb
discovered in 2012 (Johnson, 2019) and described by Zanno et al. (2019)
from the Stormy Theropod site.  Mussentuchit tyrannosauroid teeth
are provisionally referred to the taxon here.<br>
Zanno et al. (2019) recovered it as a non-eutyrannosaur more derived
than <span style="font-style: italic;">Dilong</span>
in Brusatte's TWiG matrix, a non-eutyrannosaur more derived than
"stokesosaurids" in Carr's tyrannosauroid analysis and a eutyrannosaur
sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus</span> and tyrannosaurids in
Loewen's tyrannosauroid analysis.  <br>

<b>Comments-</b>
The lectotype hindlimb AMNH 6554) was discovered on April 25 1923 at
Third Asiatic Expedition field site 136, while a partial forelimb (AMNH
6368) was found on May 4 at field site 138, 30 meters away. 
Andrews (1932) first mention the former as "the complete hindlimb of a
large carnivorous dinosaur.  The leg lay doubled up just as the
great reptile had died millions of years ago."  Gilmore (1933)
made each a syntype of his new taxon of deinodontid, <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus olseni</span>,
noting "in the field they were thought to pertain to the same
individual." but that he preferred to treat them as two
individuals.  They were considered the same taxon based on the
manual unguals (questionably associated in the case of AMNH 6554)
"being laterally compressed, strongly curved, and having sharply
pointed extremities", which are characters broadly true of almost all
theropod manual unguals.  Barsbold (1976) was the first to
consider AMNH 6368 wrongly assigned, stating "As new materials from the
MPR* show, a large ungual phalanx previously attributed to the manus of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span> (Gilmore, 1933)
does not really belong to it" (translated), citing the still
undescribed IGM 100/50 from Bayanshiree which includes "a small ungual
phalanx of the first manual digit, quite typical for
tyrannosaurids."  Further, he noted "A large, laterally compressed
ungual phalanx, similar in structure and form to that attributed to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>,
belongs to another previously unknown dinosaur (under study) found
there. This dinosaur does not belong to Tyrannosauridae.", which is a
reference to the also undescribed <span style="font-style: italic;">Segnosaurus</span>. 
In their redescription, Mader and Bradley (1989) describe AMNH 6368 in
detail and place it in Segnosauridae, and it has been viewed as
therizinosaurian since then.  As explained by Mader and Bradley,
the type listing by White (1973) combined the syntype materials, so
that Welles and Long (1974) officially declared the hindlimb as the
lectotype when they stated "we here designate this specimen, AMNH 6554,
the type of the species."  Zanno (2010: Fig. 9D) figured the
manual unguals of AMNH 6554 as therizinosaurian without comment,
although their non-tyrannosaurid characters could also be
plesiomorphically shared with e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>.<br>
Dong et al. (1989) first reported <span style="font-style: italic;">Aublysodon</span>
from the July 1988 Sino-Canadian expedition (CCDP), and Currie et al.
(1990) stated "Identical teeth [to Dinosaur Park juvenile tyrannosaurid
'<span style="font-style: italic;">Aublysodon</span>'] recently were
recovered from the Iren Dabasu Formation at Erenhot, People's Republic
of China (IVPP 170788104). The Asian "<span style="font-style: italic;">Aublysodon</span>"
teeth belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
(Perle pers. comm. 1989..."  Similarly, Dong (1992) reports "In
July 1988, the expedition of the CCDP came to Erenhot (Fig.85) where
they collected ... teeth of ... large theropods (tyrannosaurid)." 
Dong et al. first reported that in July 1988 "A partial skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span> was discovered too
late to collect", and Dong (1993) followed that up by writing "An
incomplete skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
was found by Currie [in 1988], but was not excavated until the return
expedition of 1990", which was at CCDP site #9 based on Currie and
Eberth's (1993) table 3.  They further noted "Perle (1977) ... has
been studying more recently discovered postcranial specimens (Perle,
pers. comm. 1989)" and that "The absence of denticles on the
premaxillary teeth (Perle, pers. comm. 1989; IVPP 180788-104) suggests
that it should be included in the Aublysodontinae."   The
similar field numbers to Currie et al.'s suggest one is a typo, and
serrationless premaxillary teeth are a juvenile character of
tyrannosaurines but also known in some basal tyrannosauroids (<span style="font-style: italic;">Yutyrannus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Xiongguanlong</span>).  Currie (2001)
reported "Several partial, undescribed skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
collected from southeastern Mongolia are in the collections of the
museum in Ulaanbaatar, and another new specimen was recently collected
from Erenhot in China", the latter seemingly being the one mentioned by
Dong et al..  Finally, a fragmentary skull reported by Brochu
(2003) and under study by Carr (2005b) found in 1922 (AMNH 6266;
mistakenly called AMNH 6556 by Carr) may belong to <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span> (perhaps even to the
type individual) and currently resolves close to <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinbeisaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Timurlengia</span>.  None of these
can be confirmed as belonging to the genus however, and may be
juveniles of a larger tyrannosaurid reported by Gilmore (1933) for
instance.<br>
Perle (1977) described two partial specimens (IGM 100/50, 100/51) as <i>Alectrosaurus</i>,
including skull material, which have formed much of the basis for our
understanding of the genus. However, Carr (2005a) found these specimens
differ from the holotype and could find no support for their referral.<br>
Numerous specimens from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have been
referred to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, primarily due to Nessov (1995). None
of these show autapomorphies of <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, however (Carr,
2005a). Most are teeth which cannot be compared to the taxon, though
the myth of Cenomanian-Santonian labiolingually narrow tyrannosauroid
teeth being <i>Alectrosaurus</i> has spread.<br>
The tooth reported by Gangloff (1998) from the Chandler Formation
(Albian-Cenomanian) of Alaska is actually from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
(Fiorillo and Gangloff, 2000).<br>
Carr (2005a, b) redescribes <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, noting an extremely
large number of hindlimb apomorphies which he interpreted as indicating
enhanced cursorial abilities. In a hindlimb-only phylogenetic analysis
of tyrannosaurids, <i>Alectrosaurus</i> was resolved as the sister
taxon of <i>Dryptosaurus</i>. However, the topology of tyrannosauroids
is quite different from that in analyses based on cranial characters.
When added to Brusatte et al.'s 2010 tyrannosauroid analysis, <i>Alectrosaurus</i>
is more basal than other taxa included here in Tyrannosauroidea. <br>

(AMNH 6266; "AMNH 6556" of Carr, 2005) (small) incomplete lacrimal,
anterior jugal, quadratojugal, lateral ectopterygoid, posterior
pterygoid, premaxillary teeth, lateral teeth<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Brochu (2003) noted
"A box of bone fragments (AMNH 6266) from the same locality [as <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>]
includes small tyrannosaurid skull bones (including a characteristic
jugal, lacrymal, quadratojugal, and D-shaped premaxillary tooth) that
might belong to the same individual. ... The skull parts are consistent
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span>; for
example, the jugal foramen is a dorsally-opening slit."  He states
it "had been originally catalogued as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>
sp." ..., but this was subsequently scratched off and "Theropoda
indet." written on in pencil", and the AMNH online catalogue does list
6266 as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>
? sp."  Carr (2005) later reported "an undescribed, but shattered,
tyrannosauroid skull (AMNH 6556) from the same general area - Iren
Dabasu -" as the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
lectotype, but as they are from different locations "there is no
evidence they are from the same individual."  Carr states "The
presence of a secondary fossa in the antorbital fossa of the jugal
indicates the specimen is referable to Tyrannosauridae. The cornual
process of the lacrimal is similar to some juvenile tyrannosaurids in
that it is a low, laterally extending ridge. The lateral teeth are as
finely denticulate as tyrannosauroid teeth of the same basal crown
length from the Turonian of Uzbekistan."  This is the "Iren Dabasu
taxon" in Carr's
tyrannosauroid analyses as of Carr et al. (2017), under study by Carr
and recovered in a
polytomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">Timurlengia</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Jinbeisaurus</span>
and eutyrannosaurs as of 2019.  While this is certainly the same
specimen based on material preserved, the AMNH online catalog lists
this specimen number as being a saurischian metatarsal II with a
locality "8 mi. E. of station" which would place it among Third Asiatic
Expedition field sites 140-149 (while <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>
is from 136 less than a mile south of the station).  AMNH 6556 is
listed in the catalogue as collected on April 30, which matches Carr's
statement the skull was found in late April five days apart from <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span>'
lectotype (which was found on April 25).  However, Mehling (pers.
comm. 6-2022) indicates AMNH 6556 is actually a metatarsal II and that
AMNH 6266 was discovered in 1922, so that Carr apparently got the
specimen number wrong and incorrectly used the metatarsal's discovery
date for the skull.  The early discovery makes sense considering
the low specimen number and allows us to equate the material with 
"portions of a small carnivorous dinosaur skull with two or three
teeth" found in the 1922 expedition as reported by Granger and Berkey
(1922) along with ornithomimid remains that are near certainly AMNH
6267-6268.  If it was recovered with the latter specimens, AMNH
6266 would have been found between April 25 and May 7 at one of the
western AMNH quarries (131-138), and thus may be from the same locality
the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alectrosaurus</span> type as
stated by Brochu.  Alas, the only recorded locality information in
the AMNH card catalogue is Iren Dabasu (Mehling, pers. comm. 6-2022).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1997, and reported by
Wolfe and Kirkland (1998) as a "new small dromaeosaurid theropod" and a
"small (dromaeosaurid?) theropod." The paratype was found in 2000,
including more postcranial elements. Kirkland and Wolfe (2001) referred
to the taxon as a basal coelurosaur, as did Holtz in 2001 (DML).
Indeed, casts of the skeleton are available to be purchased as the
"Zuni coelurosaur". Pringle (2001) photographed much of the skeleton in
her popular article, where the specmen was nicknamed Fred. In 2004,
Denton et al. referred to it as a basal tetanurine based on several
characters discussed below. More recently, McDonald et al. (2010)
referred to it as "a new taxon of small basal tyrannosauroid." The
television program "Planet Dinosaur" called the taxon "Zunityrannus" in
episode 6, aired in 2011. The companion book (BBC, 2011) seemingly uses
<i>Sinotyrannus</i> due to an editorial mistake, as in the closed
captions for the show, so "Zunityrannus" remained an unpublished name
until listed as a nomen nudum by Molina-Perez and Larramendi
(2019).  Nesbitt et al. (2019) named and officially described the
taxon as <span style="font-style: italic;">Suskityrannus</span>,
recovering it as sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Timurlegia</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Xiongguanglong</span>
and eutyrannosaurs in Brusatte's TWiG matrix and Brusatte and Carr's
tyrannosauroid matrix.  They found it emerged as an alioramin
eutyrannosaur in Loewen et al.'s tyrannosauroid matrix.<br>

<i><b>E. minax</b></i> Riabinin, 1931<br>
<b>Berriasian-Hauterivian, Early Cretaceous<br>
Neocomian Sands, Mount Koi-Kara, Kazakhstan</b><br>
<b>Syntypes</b>- (subadult) partial ?posterior cervical centrum (~63
mm), mid dorsal centrum (102 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- (proposed) differs from <i>Xiongguanlong</i> in
being over 170% larger and having less steeply angled cervical centra.<br>
<b>Previous diagnoses-</b> While not providing a formal diagnosis,
Riabinin (1931) distinguished <i>Embasaurus</i> from <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
because the latter has shallower ventral concavities on its caudal
centra than <i>Embasaurus</i> does on its dorsal centrum (expected
when comparing caudals to dorsals), from <i>Spinosaurus</i> due to its
non-opisthocoelous centra (a plesiomorphy), from <i>Ceratosaurus</i>
due to its supposedly more gently sloping ventral centrum margin and
flat articular surfaces (both known in <i>Ceratosaurus</i>), and from <i>Allosaurus</i>
for the same reasons plus the much shallower and less angled ventral
centrum margin of the dorsal (all of which are similar to mid dorsals
of <i>Allosaurus</i>).<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The two syntype vertebral centra of <i>Embasaurus</i>
were discovered in 1927 and described by Riabinin in 1931.<br>
The larger centrum is platycoelous or amphiplatyan, 107% longer than
tall, 107% wider than tall, has a ventral concavity 17% of centrum
depth, and lacks pleurocoels or a ventral keel. What may be the ventral
part of the parapophysis is visible anteriorly. The neural arch is
unpreserved and was not fused to the centrum, indicating the individual
was not adult. <br>
The smaller centrum is missing its anterior end, but its length can be
estimated using the posterior width and angle of anterior transverse
expansion. While it is much smaller (width ~51% of the larger centrum),
this amount of disparity is known between posterior dorsals and
anterior cervicals in many theropods (e.g. <i>Majungasaurus</i>). The
angle between the posterior articular surface and ventral edge suggests
it is a cervical centrum, contra Riabinin. The posterior surface is
flat and 64% as wide as tall, with the length estimated at 94% of the
height. The ventral surface is keeled along its entire length and there
are no pleurocoels preserved, though they may have been present
anteriorly. Only the bases of the neural arches are preserved and the
centrum interior is hollow. <br>
Riabinin (1931) referred <i>Embasaurus</i> to Carnosauria sensu lato
based on its size, and to Megalosauridae (also sensu lato, including
allosauroids and megalosauroids except <i>Spinosaurus</i>) based on
"general form". The few times authors have mentioned <i>Embasaurus</i>
since (Nessov, 1995; Currie, 2000) have repeated this possible
identification without supporting evidence. Molnar (1990) thought it
was primitive due to the platycoelous dorsal centrum and excluded it
from Carnosauria sensu Gauthier (allosauroids and tyrannosaurids)
because of it, but most of the taxa he viewed as carnosaurs actually do
have roughly amphicoelous-amphiplatyan dorsals, besides the anterior
dorsals of allosauroids.<br>
<i>Embasaurus</i> can be excluded from Ceratosauria based on its lack
of a posterior cervical pleurocoel, though it is similar to many in
having a ventral keel and flat posterior surface. <i>Megalosaurus</i>
itself and other megalosaurids differ in having opisthocoelous cervical
centra without a ventral keel, though the posterior dorsal centra are
roughly similar. Spinosaurids differ in the same way. Some
carcharodontosaurids have ventral keels (e.g. <i>Carcharodontosaurus</i>),
but all carnosaurs differ in having opisthocoelous cervical centra.
Tyrannosauroids are similar in being large and having
non-opisthocoelous cervicals, and the Early Cretaceous basal
tyrannosauroid <i>Xiongguanlong</i> is similar in having amphiplatyan
cervicals with an elongate ventral keel on at least cervical ten and
lacking posterior dorsal pleurocoels. The only obvious difference is
that <i>Embasaurus</i> has a less steeply angled ventral edge on its
cervical centrum than any cervical of <i>Xiongguanlong</i> and that
the subadult <i>Embasaurus</i> individual was 170% larger than the
adult <i>Xiongguanlong</i> holotype. Among other tyrannosauroids, <i>Dilong</i>
differs in having opisthocoelous cervicals and amphicoelous dorsals
that are more elongate, <i>Stokesosaurus</i> differs in having
platycoelous or opisthocoelous cervicals and amphicoelous dorsals, and
tyrannosaurids themselves lack ventral keels and have entirely
pleurocoelous dorsal centra. Therizinosaurs, ornithomimosaurs and
oviraptorosaurs sometimes get comparably large and have
non-opisthocoelous cervicals, but the first two have ventrally
tranversely concave cervical centra, and all three have elongate
cervical vertebrae. Besides <i>Xiongguanlong</i>, the only close
resemblence is to basal tetanurines like <i>Condorraptor</i> and <i>Szechuanosaurus?
zigongensis</i>, which have platycoelous and keeled cervicals (in at
least ~4 and ~10 in <i>Condorraptor</i> and only in 9-10 in <i>zigongensis</i>)
along with platycoelous posterior dorsals that lack pleurocoels. These
were generally extinct by the Cretaceous, though specimens like <i>Erectopus</i>
and the Baharija <i>"Elaphrosaurus"</i> tibiae of Stromer may show
they survived long enough for <i>Embasaurus</i> to be a
representative. Besides having posteriorly concave cervical centra, <i>Condorraptor</i>
differs in having its cervical keels only developed anteriorly as
hypapophyses and in lateral view the posteroventral centrum edge is
convex in its cervicals. <i>Szechuanosaurus? zigongensis</i> also
differs in having posteriorly concave cervical centra, with cervicals
nine and ten broader and with more deeply concave ventral edges. In
conclusion, <i>Embasaurus</i> is most similar to the basal
tyrannosauroid <i>Xiongguanlong</i>, which is also close
stratigraphically and geographically. It is less similar to the
generally earlier basal tetanurines, so is referred here to
Tyrannosauroidea. Within Tyrannosauroidea, it is more derived than <i>Dilong</i>
due to its short dorsal vertebrae but excluded from Tyrannosauridae due
to its lack of mid/posterior dorsal pleurocoels. As it differs from all
comparable taxa, it is not a nomen dubium as suggested by Molnar and
Holtz et al. (2004), neither of whom even compared it critically to
other taxa.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Brusatte et al., 2016) diamond-shaped ventral
projection of supraoccipital that is excluded from foramen magnum;
extremely short basal tubera, approximately one third depth of
occipital condyle; deep, funnel-like otic recess that widely opens onto
lateral surface of braincase and extends far medially; large inner ear
with robust semicircular canals.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The first Bissekty tyrannosauroid material was
referred to <i>Allosaurus sp.</i> by Sosedko (1937), then
Deinodontidae by Efremov (1944).<br>
Nessov (1995) referred material from the Bissekty Formation of
Ukbekistan to <i>Alectrosaurus sp.</i>. None exhibit <i>Alectrosaurus</i>
synapomorphies and several cannot be compared to the lectotype (Carr,
2005). This includes three teeth (within CCMGE 433-442) among those
later described by Averianov and Sues (2012). He assigned CCMGE
445/12457 tentatively to juvenile <i>Alectrosaurus sp.</i> as a
metacarpal I. Carr thought it appeared to be a pedal phalanx IV-1, but
could not compare it in detail to confirm the taxonomic identification.
Nessov also assigned two pedal unguals (CCMGE 463/12457 and 464/12457)
tentatively to <i>Alectrosaurus sp.</i>, but Carr could not compare
them in detail to confirm this identification. Additionally, thicker
teeth (e.g. CCMGE 485/12457) were assigned to Tyrannosauridae by
Nessov, and premaxillary teeth were assigned to <i>Aublysodon sp.</i>,
all of which Averianov and Sues include among the tyrannosauroid teeth
they describe. Nessov also assigned a distal caudal (CCMGE 477/12475)
to Theropoda indet., which as reassigned to Tyrannosauroidea by
Averianov and Sues.<br>
Material referred to <i>Alectrosaurus</i> by Ryan (1997) from the
"Kulbecke Formation" of Uzbekistan are actually from the Bissekty
Formation (Nessov, 1995). <br>
Archibald et al. (1998) reported tyrannosaurid teeth and bones from the
Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, three of which were examined by Carr
(2005). He found they were not referrable to <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, as
they lack numerous apomorphies of that genus when comparable. <br>
Averianov (2007) notes 77 tyrannosaurid teeth are present, referring to
the 77 lateral teeth later described by Averianov and Sues. <br>
Averianov and Sues redescribed the Bissekty tyrannosauroid remains,
beliving them to pertain to one taxon due to the lack of variation and
supposed lack of other faunas with two tyrannosauroids (yet the
Dinosaur Park Formation does, so this is not valid). Coding them as one
OTU, the material fell out more derived than <i>Raptorex</i> and <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
(based on the extensive frontal supratemporal fossa, short cervical
centra and rugose dorsal neural spines), but less than <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>,
<i>Bistahieversor</i> and Tyrannosauridae. Brusatte et al. (2015) later
proposed it was related to <i>Xiongguanlong</i> based on small basal
tubera and a diamond-shaped ventral supraoccipital process. This was
later officially published as Brusatte et al. (2016), who named the
taxon <i>Timurlengia</i> and described two new braincases as the
holotype and paratype. Using Brusatte's version of the TWG matrix, they
found the holotype to be in a polytomy with <i>Juratyrant</i>, <i>Eotyannus</i>
and <i>Dilong</i>, the non-braincase material to be sister to <i>Xiongguanlong</i>
(thus more basal than Averianov and Sues' analysis), and both combined
to be between <i>Dilong</i> and <i>Xiongguanlong</i> in a polytomy
with <i>Juratyrant</i> and <i>Eotyrannus</i>. <br>

<b>Holotype-</b> (AMNH 3956) (adult) anterior dentary tooth (&gt;25 mm)<br>
....(?) anterior tooth (&gt;11 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Molnar and Carpenter (1989) thought the serrated
carinae indicated this was a lateral premaxillary tooth from <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
but juvenile tyrannosaurids can have serrated carinae as well (e.g. CMN
41104) and the larger tooth is much too large for <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>.<br>
This taxon is based on two teeth, one much larger than the other. Both
are clearly anterior teeth, as the mesial carina is shifted lingually
(not laterally as in Cope's description). The larger one is described
in more detail and must be tyrannosaurid based on size (FABL of 18 mm,
compared to 8 mm or less for other Judith River theropods). The
photograph in Glut (1997) resembles dentary tooth 4 of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
most closely and is between dentary teeth 4 and 6 of <i>Gorgosaurus</i>
in crown compression. It is comparable in size to adult tyrannosaurids
(FABL of <i>Gorgosaurus</i> specimen ROM 1247 is 21 mm; of <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
specimen MOR 590 is 23 mm), so is probably itself from an adult. The
compression (.56) is comparable to <i>Gorgosaurus</i> (.51-.61) but
less than <i>Daspletosaurus</i> (.74-.78), making it probably
referrable to the former taxon. Both carinae are serrated and the photo
indicates the apical portion has been worn away.<br>
The smaller tooth has a FABL of 6 mm, putting it within the size range
of <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> in addition to juvenile tyrannosaurids. It is
not described except to note similarity to the large tooth with the
exception of having a less truncated lingual face. The photo confirms
this, but it is merely due to the angle of wear as opposed to any
anatomical difference. It may be another tyrannosaurid anterior dentary
tooth, or perhaps a <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> premaxillary tooth.<br>

anterior right dentary (Sullivan and Williamson, 1997)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- ACM 7975 was
discovered in July or August 1924, and figured and briefly described by
Dalman and Lucas (2016) as "Tyrannosauridae indeterminate" despite the
authors listing two characters purportedly differentiating it from
other tyrannosaurids.  Namely, "the possession of two foramina
intermandibularis oralis" and "the morphology of the anterior step of
the lingual bar" which "is anterodorsally inclined and has a relatively
short posterior surface (towards the mouth), whereas in other
tyrannosaurids (e.g., <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>,
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>) the posterior
surface of the step is well-developed and nearly the same length as the
dorsal surface."<br>
Dalman (2013) stated "the many isolated but diagnostic tyrannosaurid
skeletal fossil elements from the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo
Formation (early Maastrichtian) of northwestern New Mexico (Sullivan et
al. 2005; Jasinski et al. 2011; Dalman and Lucas, in press) provide
evidence for the occurrence of a new taxon of a large tyrannosaurid"
with the in press paper's bibliographic entry naming it "Alamotyrannus
brinkmani." Stuchlik (pers. comm. to Dalman, 7-2018) informs me the
intended holotype was two dentaries, presumedly including ACM 7975 that
was mentioned in Dalman (2013) as "the new Ojo Alamo tyrannosaurid
taxon ACM 7975." Dalman (pers. comm. to Demirjian, 2015) stated the
paper is postponed as more complete remains were discovered, and that
the taxon would receive a different name.  A probable explanation
is
that Dalman and Lucas (2016) briefly described and figured ACM 7975 as
a diagnostic tyrannosaurid under study by Dalman but noted that the
previous referral to the Ojo Alamo Formation was due to its discoverer
Loomis using an old, broader definition for the formation. 
Geographical and preservational data indicated instead that ACM 7975
was probably from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, so
mixing it with the diagnostic Ojo Alamo elements noted by Dalman (2013)
would make his "Alamotyrannus" concept a chimaera.  Thus Dalman
would want to
describe the diagnostic Kirtland dentary and the diagnostic Ojo Alamo
elements as different taxa, which seems to be the plan based on his
2024 online curriculum vitae.  <br>
This lists "Dalman, S.G., Jasinski, S.E., Lucas, S.G., Malinzak, D.E.,
Loewen, M.A., Fiorillo, A.R., Currie, P.J. 2024. <span style="font-style: italic;">Bistityrannus anax</span>,
a new tyrannosaurid from the Kirtland Formation (Upper Cretaceous) of
northwestern New Mexico. Cretaceous Research (in review/in progress)"
under Published Research despite being unpublished
as of
9-21-2024.  The genus and species are obviously invalid pending
this
publication as his online curriculum vitae is not "issued for the
purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific record" (IZCN
Article 8.1.1), "produced in an edition containing simultaneously
obtainable copies by a method that assures 8.1.3.1. numerous identical
and durable copies (see Article 8.4), or 8.1.3.2. widely accessible
electronic copies with fixed content and layout" (Article 8.1.3), does
not "state the date of publication in the work itself, and" is not
"registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred" (Articles 8.5.2 and 8.5.3), the
taxa are not "accompanied by a description or definition that states in
words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon"
(Article 13.1) or "explicitly indicated as intentionally new" (Article
16.1).<br>
Another unpublished entry on that page with identical authorship is "<span style="font-style: italic;">Denazinosaurus sicarius</span>,
a new tyrannosaurid from the Kirtland Formation (De-na-zin Member)
Upper Cretaceous of New Mexico, USA", giving us two proposed new
Kirtland tyrannosaurids with nothing distinguishing them in their
publication titles besides "Denazinosaurus" definitely being from the
De-na-zin Member.  While either or neither of these could be
intended
for former "Alamotyrannus" dentary ACM 7975, it's here suggested the
stratigraphic uncertainty behind that specimen's discovery makes
De-Na-Zin unlikely to feature in the article title or genus name. 
Thus
ACM 7975 is probably "Bistityrannus", while "Denazinosaurus" would be a
different specimen with a more definite locality.  Given most
De-Na-Zin
tyrannosaurid specimens are isolated teeth and postcrania (generally
considered indeterminate in Tyrannosauridae), that ideally Dalman would
want a specimen comparable to ACM 7975 to erect a new contemporaneous
species distinct from it, and that he is describing other
tyrannosaurids based on dentaries (see Fruitland Formation KU
VP-96888), the obvious identity of "Denazinosaurus" would be classic
dentary USNM V 8346 described by Gilmore in 1916 (see entry). 
Whether
this logic proves true awaits either publication.  <br>
Interestingly, given Dalman originally intended to name "Alamotyrannus"
based on two dentary syntypes including ACM 7975, it implies a second
tyrannosaur dentary plausibly from the Ojo Alamo Formation.  While
NMMNH P-7199 is an obvious possibility as the only dentary I know
of confirmed from that formation, it's so poorly preserved that it's
never even been figured.  I propose a more likely possibility is
anterior dentary PMU.R35 whose locality can only be specified to San
Juan County, and which seems to have the anterior step morphology
described for ACM 7975- anterodorsally inclined with a short posterior
surface (Sullivan and Williamson, 1997- Fig. 1D).  As its
uncertain
stratigraphic placement makes it plausibly from the De-Na-Zin Member,
this may be an additional specimen of "Bistityrannus".  Discovered
in
1921 or 1922, this was not published until Sullivan and Williamson's
1997 review of PMU specimens sent by Sternberg, where it is figured in
lateral and medial views as "tyrannosaurid partial right
dentary."  <br>

symmetrical section proximally, but Brusatte et al. (2013) showed this
is normal for theropod scapulae and that at midshaft the blade has the
usual theropod shape of a teardrop wider dorsally. The latter authors
redescribed the specimen and noted numerous similarities with
tyrannosaurids. They assigned it to Tyrannosauroidea more derived than <i>Dilong</i>

<b>Comments</b>- Leidy (1856) based this species on fourteen teeth and
tooth fragments discovered in the Judith River Group of Montana. Most
were lateral teeth he regarded as different from <i>Megalosaurus</i>
only in their greater labiolingual thickness, but Leidy placed species
in the new genus <i>Deinodon</i> because of several other teeth which
he felt were distinctive. These were ANSP 9531, 9533, 9534 and 9535,
which can all now be recognized as tyrannosaurid anterior teeth. Leidy
later (1857) sunk his own genus into <i>Megalosaurus</i> as a subgenus
to create the short lived combination <i>Megalosaurus (Deinodon)
horridus</i>. Cope (1866) described the teeth of <i>Deinodon</i> as
D-shaped, referencing 9533-9535, to distinguish them from his new taxon
<i>Laelaps</i> (later renamed <i>Dryptosaurus</i>). This makes him
first reviser of the genus, and connected the name <i>Deinodon horridus</i>
to the D-shaped teeth in Leidy's syntype series. Cope considered the
lateral teeth to belong to <i>Laelaps</i>. Leidy (1868) created the
new taxon <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i> for ANSP 9533-9535, intending to
retain <i>Deinodon horridus</i> for the lateral teeth (at least ANSP
9530, 9536 and 9541-9543). Cope's 1866 specification of <i>Deinodon</i>
for the D-shaped teeth has priority though, making <i>Aublysodon
mirandus</i> an objective junior synonym of <i>Deinodon horridus</i>.
Later, Cope (1868) believed <i>Deinodon</i> was preoccupied by the
snake genus <i>Dinodon</i>, and used the name <i>Aublysodon horridus</i>
for the anterior teeth (since he had attached the species name <i>horridus</i>
to the teeth in 1866). Yet Hay (1899) correctly noted the spellings are
different, and thus <i>Deinodon</i> is still valid. Marsh (1892)
followed Leidy's (1868) assignment of D-shaped teeth to <i>Aublysodon</i>,
and considered ANSP 9535 to be typical of <i>A. mirandus</i>, while
ANSP 9533 and 9534 were considered examples of another unnamed <i>Aublysodon</i>
species. <i>A. mirandus</i> was notable for its lack of serrations
compared to 9533 and 9534. This made ANSP 9535 the lectotype of <i>Aublysodon</i>,
which was formalized by Carpenter (1982). ANSP 9533 and 9534 are thus
implicitly the remaining syntypes of <i>Deinodon</i>. Hay (1899)
realized restricting <i>Deinodon</i> and/or <i>Aublysodon</i> to the
D-shaped teeth meant the lateral teeth were without a taxon. Based on
the resemblence to <i>Dryptosaurus</i>, he made these teeth the
syntypes of <i>Dryptosaurus kenabekides</i>. Matthew and Brown (1922)
synonymized <i>Deinodon horridus</i> with <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i>
and <i>Dryptosaurus kenabekides</i>, and tentatively with <i>Aublysodon
lateralis</i>, <i>Laelaps incrassatus</i>, <i>L. hazenianus</i>, and <i>Ornithomimus
grandis</i>. They viewed <i>Albertosaurus</i> and/or <i>Gorgosaurus</i>
as probably being <i>Deinodon</i> as well. Russell (1970) stated the <i>Deinodon</i>
syntypes cannot be distinguished from <i>Gorgosaurus</i> or <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
and the genus is thus a nomen dubium. As there is no particular
taxonomic reason to separate the lateral and premaxillary teeth (which
all may belong to different individuals and taxa in any case), they are
all retained here under <i>Deinodon horridus</i>.<br>
ANSP 9530 (figures 21-24 in Leidy, 1856) consists of two tooth
fragments- a mesial edge, and the tip. It was considered typical of <i>Deinodon
horridus</i> by Leidy (1868), but made a syntype of <i>Dryptosaurus
kenabekides</i> by Hay (1899). Serrations extend from the tip most of
the way down the mesial carina and along the preserved tip of the
distal carina. The mesial carina shifts lingually at its base, as in
the second through ninth maxillary teeth and fifth through eighth
dentary teeth of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. The estimated crown compression
(~.50) is more similar to <i>Gorgosaurus</i> (.51-.68) than to <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
(&gt;55-.76), so it may belong to <i>Gorgosaurus</i>.<br>
ANSP 9531 (figures 46-48) is a small tooth crown described by Leidy in
1856 and 1860 as different than the majority of <i>Deinodon</i> teeth,
but not included as an <i>Aublysodon</i> syntype in 1868, or
necessarily referenced by Cope (1866) in his revision of <i>Deinodon</i>
since it is not D-shaped in the cross section illustrated. Its
taxonomic status is thus a referred specimen of <i>Deinodon horridus</i>.
It is nearly conical, with a compression of .90. Both carinae are
serrated and shifted lingually to form a D-shape apically. The crown
itself is straight in lingual view, though curved slightly lingually.
This morphology compares to the first dentary tooth of tyrannosaurids,
but whether it is referrable to <i>Gorgosaurus</i> or <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
is unknown.<br>
ANSP 9533 and 9534 are syntypes of <i>Deinodon horridus</i>, and
paralectotypes of <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i>. ANSP 9533 (figures
37-40) is clearly a tyrannosaurid premaxillary tooth, being
labiolingually wider than mesiodistally long (by 153%) and D-shaped.
Both carinae are serrated and the lingual face is slightly convex.
Lambe (1917) felt it was more robust than <i>Gorgosaurus</i>, but no
detailed comparisons between <i>Gorgosaurus</i> and <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
premaxillary teeth have been made. ANSP 9534 (figures 33-34) consists
of a fragment which has a serrated carina that forms a right angle in
section. It may be a second dentary tooth, as this has a right angled
distal carina in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>.<br>
ANSP 9535 (figures 41-45) is the lectotype of <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i>.
As it lacks serrations, it is a juvenile tyrannosaurine premaxillary
tooth and probably referrable to <i>Daspletosaurus</i> (see <i>Aublysodon</i>
entry).<br>
ANSP 9536, 9541, 9542 and 9543 are all syntypes of <i>Dryptosaurus
kenabekides</i> and considered <i>Deinodon horridus</i> by Leidy in
1868. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- The described tooth lacks mesial serrations, as in
some examples of juvenile tyrannosaurids, <i>Richardoestesia</i> and <i>Saurornitholestes</i>.
Crown compression (BW of 4.0 mm / FABL of 5.6 mm) is comparable to
tyrannosaurids and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>, but outside the range of <i>Saurornitholestes</i>
and <i>Richardoestesia</i>. Crown elongation is similar to all except <i>Richardoestesia</i>.
When compression and elongation are analyzed together, <i>falculus</i>
falls out within Tyrannosauridae, just outside <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>,
and far from <i>Saurornitholestes</i> and <i>Richardoestesia</i>.
Similarly, serration size (at least 5/mm) falls out within
tyrannosaurids when plotted against BW, and within tyrannosaurids and <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>
when plotted against crown compression. When all components are
analyzed together, <i>falculus</i> is comparable to tyrannosaurids and
very close to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i>. The evidence suggests that <i>falculus</i>
is a juvenile tyrannosaurid tooth, probably <i>Gorgosaurus</i> and/or <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
based on provenance.<br>
The teeth figured as <i>Laelaps falculus</i> by Glut (1997) are
actually AMNH 3968, unnamed tyrannosaurid teeth. The type teeth remain

<b>Syntypes-</b> (AMNH 3957) (juvenile) posterior tooth (14 mm)<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Cope (1876) notes the type tooth has a FABL of 11 mm
and a CW of 7 mm. While the thickness limits the teeth to
dromaeosaurines and juvenile tyrannosaurids, the size and shortness is
only comparable to the latter. The serration size is comparable to
either, as is the mesial carina twisting lingually(?). The lack of
facets or flattened sides eliminates <i>Zapsalis</i> from
consideration. Sankey et al. (2002) noted that many tyrannosaurid teeth
that had twisted mesial carinae were transitional between premaxillary
and maxillary teeth, however Smith (2005) finds that the shortest and
most curved tyrannosaurid crowns are from the first dentary tooth
(which has a different morphology), last two maxillary teeth and last
three dentary teeth. <i>D? hazenianus</i> probably consists of
posterior maxillary and dentary teeth from juvenile tyrannosaurids,
probably <i>Gorgosaurus</i> and/or <i>Daspletosaurus</i> based on the
locality. They are illustrated by Glut (1997).<br>

1915, this was initially described by Gilmore (1916) as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>?" and figured in medial
view.  He noted "In the number of tooth sockets this jaw agrees
with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamosaurus imperosus</span>
Osborn,<sup>a</sup> [now <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span>] but in the general form of the dentary, particularly the
contour of the anterior end, it approaches <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span><sup>4</sup> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>) most nearly, but as
the dentary of <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span>
has sockets for 15 teeth the presence of 13 in this individual would
appear to show its distinctness."  Gilmore further stated "It is
quite
possible that this dentary pertains to the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>,
but that can not be determined at this time because the dentary of that
genus is unknown. The identification of this specimen must therefore
await the discovery of additional material."  Gilmore (1920)
repeated
most of this verbatim, listing it as "DEINODON, species." this
time. 
In a later publication, Gilmore (1935) wrote "Comparison of this bone
directly with a dentary of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gorgosaurus
libratus</span>
Lambe from the Belly River of Canada now shows such close resemblances
in size, shape, and other characteristics down to the smallest details
as to leave little doubt of their being congeneric. Likewise, the
number of alveoli (13) is in agreement with Lambe’s (1917)
determination from a number of specimens that the dentary in this genus
bears 13 or 14 teeth."  Lucas et al. (1987) felt the dentary
"almost
certainly pertain[s] to <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span>"
sensu Russell 1970, equating to modern Albertosaurinae.  Carr and
Williamson (2000) figured the dentary in lateral, medial and dorsal
views, and stated "Based on personal observation of this and other
tyrannosaurid dentaries, this bone does not appear to be diagnostic at
the specific or generic levels."  They noted "There are actually
14
dental alveoli" and concluded "Because the alveolus count of USNM 8346
overlaps with that of <span style="font-style: italic;">A. libratus</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span>
and in light of the fact that tooth count is variable in these species,
we consider it best to consider this specimen as indeterminate
Tyrannosauridae."  Indeed, 14 dentary alveoli are also present in
some <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus sarcophagus</span>
(AMNH 5222, TMP 1986.064.0001), <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus

this
publication as his online curriculum vitae is not "issued for the

Article 8.1.1), "produced in an edition containing simultaneously
obtainable copies by a method that assures 8.1.3.1. numerous identical
and durable copies (see Article 8.4), or 8.1.3.2. widely accessible
electronic copies with fixed content and layout" (Article 8.1.3), does
not "state the date of publication in the work itself, and" is not
"registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred" (Articles 8.5.2 and 8.5.3), the
taxa are not "accompanied by a description or definition that states in
words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon"
(Article 13.1) or "explicitly indicated as intentionally new" (Article
16.1).<br>
Another unpublished entry on that page with identical authorship is "<span style="font-style: italic;">Bistityrannus anax</span>, a new
tyrannosaurid from the Kirtland Formation (Upper Cretaceous) of
northwestern New Mexico", giving us two proposed new
Kirtland tyrannosaurids with nothing distinguishing them in their
publication titles besides "Denazinosaurus" definitely being from the
De-na-zin Member.  While either or neither of these could be
intended
for former "Alamotyrannus" dentary ACM 7975 (see "Bistityrannus"
entry), it's here suggested the
stratigraphic uncertainty behind that specimen's discovery makes
De-Na-Zin unlikely to feature in the article title or genus name. 
Thus
ACM 7975 is probably "Bistityrannus", while "Denazinosaurus" would be a
different specimen with a more definite locality.  Given most
De-Na-Zin
tyrannosaurid specimens are isolated teeth and postcrania (generally
considered indeterminate in Tyrannosauridae), that ideally Dalman would
want a specimen comparable to ACM 7975 to erect a new contemporaneous
species distinct from it, and that he is describing other
tyrannosaurids based on dentaries (see Fruitland Formation KU
VP-96888), the obvious identity of "Denazinosaurus" would be classic
dentary USNM V 8346.  Whether
this logic proves true awaits either publication.<br>

(2021) state "The specimen is being described by us in detail in

also say "When compared to the dentaries of other tyrannosaurids such

Coincidentally, Dalman's 2024 online curriculum vitae lists "Dalman,

progress)" despite being unpublished
as of
9-21-2024.  The genus and species are obviously invalid pending
this
publication as his online curriculum vitae is not "issued for the
purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific record" (IZCN
Article 8.1.1), "produced in an edition containing simultaneously
obtainable copies by a method that assures 8.1.3.1. numerous identical
and durable copies (see Article 8.4), or 8.1.3.2. widely accessible
electronic copies with fixed content and layout" (Article 8.1.3), does
not "state the date of publication in the work itself, and" is not
"registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred" (Articles 8.5.2 and 8.5.3), the
taxa are not "accompanied by a description or definition that states in
words characters that are purported to differentiate the taxon"
(Article 13.1) or "explicitly indicated as intentionally new" (Article
16.1).<br>
Unless Dalman and Lucas are describing multiple new genera of
tyrannosaurids from the Fruitland Formation, it seems likely
"Erinotonax" is KU VP-96888.  Given its fragmentary and
pathological condition, I'm skeptical of any future diagnosis.<br>

to tyrannosaurids in having an anterior fossa just proximal to the
articular condyle and lacking the proximally extended articular surface
(posteriorly) of troodontids. It's probably a juvenile <i>Gorgosaurus</i>

The element was discovered in April 10 2012 and described by Peecook

and
fourth trochanter indicate it is probably tyrannosaurid, but it is
indeterminate.  In 2019 the 66th Legislature of the State of
Washington
proposed House Bill 2155 designating a state dinosaur, which stated
"the dinosaur has been nicknamed Suciasaurus rex."  This and the
Substitute House Bill 2155 for the 2020 session which made some
adjustments were covered by the media in those years.<br>

?...(AMNH 2553) proximal metatarsal II or IV<br>
<b>Diagnosis</b>- Indeterminate compared to <i>Bistahieversor</i> and <i>Alioramus</i>.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Previously (2010) this website proposed a
diagnosis for <i>macropus</i> combining "lateral tibial malleolus at
same level as medial malleolus" and "paired proximoventral processes on
pedal phalanges II-1 and III-2", but with the former now known in
multiple tyrannosauroids and the latter referrable to a different
taxon, I agree with Brownstein that the species is indeterminate though
distinct from other named eastern American tyrannosauroids.<br>
In addition to those two, Yun (2017) listed more characters in his
diagnosis. Brownstein dismissed "medial tibial condyle is triangular,
whereas lateral tibial condyle is round" and "medial tibial condyle is
positioned higher than lateral tibial condyle" as being due to poor
preservation and erosion. Similarly, Brownstein interpreted the "small
tubercle ... present between the well-separated medial and lateral
tibial condyle" to be merely the less eroded portion of the bone
surface. Brownstein noted that while the "intercondylar notch is deep
and “I” shaped" in AMNH 2550, that <i>Appalachiosaurus</i> has a
similar shape and that erosion could have modified its depth. Finally,
that the "cnemial crest can be seen at the posterior view of [the]
proximal tibia" is normal, and the opposite is only present in <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
due to erosion.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Leidy (1865) originally described this material as
syntypes of his new taxon <i>Coelosaurus antiquus</i>. Cope (1868)
separated it as <i>Laelaps macropus</i>, distinguishing it from <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
(his <i>Laelaps</i>) <i>aquilunguis</i> by its relatively longer
pedal phalanges. He later (1870) described it in more detail and
illustrated some elements. Cope distinguished it from <i>"Coelosaurus"</i>
by its larger size and more expanded distal tibia, and from <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
by its anterior process on the lateral tibial condyle. Matthew and
Brown (1922) considered it probable that the specimen was referrable to
<i>"Coelosaurus" antiquus</i> after all, which has been the consensus
ever since on the rare times <i>macropus</i> is mentioned. Gallagher
(1997) photographed all the material, though note the distal tibial
piece is placed above the proximal piece in his figure. Holtz (2004)
listed it as an indeterminate tyrannosauroid without comment. Most
recently, Yun was mistakenly told the material was missing and
published a short paper (Yun, 2017) only using information from the
literature (including this website, without attribution) attempting to
name the genus <i>Teihivenator</i>. However, the syntypes are all
accounted for and were being redescribed by Brownstein (2017) as a
chimaera of tyrannosauroid and ornithomimosaur elements. Notably, Yun's
paper is not available in physical form and lacks a ZooBank
registration, making the genus a nomen nudum (ICZN Article 8.5.3).
While Yun did later register the genus at ZooBank, Article 8.5.3 states
that a name must "be registered in the Official Register of Zoological
Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the
work itself that such registration has occurred." Since the work itself
lacks such evidence, the name remains a nomen nudum until the
publication of a corrigendum. Brownstein intends to designate a
lectotype in a future draft of his paper.<br>
The tibia is tyrannosauroid based on the anterior process of the
lateral tibial condyle, and also matches tyrannosaurids more than
ornithomimids in the rounded posterolateral edge of the medial condyle.
The lateral corner is placed more posteriorly than <i>Alectrosaurus</i>,
<i>Appalachiosaurus</i> or <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, but is more similar
to <i>Albertosaurus</i> and <i>Dryptosaurus</i>. The more open
triangular posterior groove resembles <i>Appalachiosaurus</i> and <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
more than <i>Alectrosaurus</i>, <i>Albertosaurus</i> or <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>.
The distal tibia has a less ventrally projecting lateral malleolus than
most other tyrannosauroids except <i>Bistahieversor</i> and <i>Alioramus</i>.
Brownstein (2017) asssigned distal metatarsal AMNH 2552 and proximal
metatarsal AMNH 2553 to either Tyrannosauroidea or Ornithomimosauria,
noting their color and wear differs from the tibia, but may indicate
these two specimens were associated. The three pedal phalanges were
referred to Ornithomimosauria by Brownstein, based in part on their
paired ventral proximoventral projections. These speciemns are retained
under the <i>macropus</i> heading here, pending publication and
official lectotype designation by Brownstein.<br>

its age. Fiorillo and Tykoski's (2013) material is from 3-4 sites from

(locality 67, section F). Ojo Alamo sandstone" and "Teeth of
carnivorous dinosaurs" from ""North side of Barrel Spring Arroyo, half
a mile west of wagon road from Ojo Alamo; 10 feet above 'lower'
conglomerate" (locality 63, section F). Ojo Alamo sandstone." 
These
were both identified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinodon</span>?
and placed in Megalosauridae.  They were recovered in 1915 but are
no
longer in the USNM collection if they were ever reposited there. 
Gilmore (1919) later reported "A few fragmentary vertebrae of a very
large carnivorous dinosaur were collected by J. B. Reeside, jr., in
Barrel Spring Arroyo, west of the road, 1 mile south of Ojo Alamo, N.
Mex., 3 to 8 feet above the base of the Ojo Alamo formation. This
specimen is too fragmentary to be identified and is of interest only as
showing the occurrence in the Ojo Alamo formation of a large
carnivorous dinosaur of the proportions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>."
He referred these to Megalosauridae genus and species
undetermined. 
Carr and Williamson (2000) reported "this material ... cannot now be
located."  Barrel Springs has since been renamed De-na-zin
Wash.  Lehman (1981) reported "A large number of detached
tyrannosaurid teeth are present in the UNM [now in the NMMNH]
collection. ... Serration counts recorded for the UNM collection of
tyrannosaurid teeth indicate the presence of animals more nearly
related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> (with about 9 to 15
serrations per 5 mm) than to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
(with about 6 to 9 serrations per 5 mm ... )."  Williamson and
Carr
(2005) stated "Two isolated teeth, NMMNH P-13000 [covered here in the
De-na-zin tyrannosauroid entry following Jasinski et al., 2011] and
P-32888, exceed the dimensions of teeth referred to all non-<span style="font-style: italic;">T.rex</span> North American tyrannosaurs
and fall within the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span>.
In addition, they have a large denticle size (denticle size is
correlated with tooth size), relative to non-<span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span>
tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaur postcranial bones include a partial
metatarsal (P-33894), a pedal phalanx (AMNH 5882), and a nearly
complete tibia (P-32812)", all identified by the authors as cf. <i>Tyrannosaurus
rex</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Stephenson (1912) noted "Among the vertebrate remains from [Phoebus
landing] which are now in the U.S. National Museum, the following forms
have been identified by C. W. Gilmore:" "Carnivorous dinosaur
(Zatomus?)."  Miller (1967) referred this to "Gorgosaurus?",
stating it is "flattened laterally, has a serrate anterior keel that
trends lingually toward the base of the crown, and a serrate, vertical,
posterior keel" and further states that "ANSP 15331 consists of an
identical, but incomplete tooth."  He says the latter "is
identical to a tooth in the left jaw of Gorgosaurus libratus (USNM
12814). It matches the eleventh tooth, counted caudally, in size and
form."  Baird and Horner (1979) note 'ANSP 15331' is actually
15332 and consists of two teeth, which they figure.  Being an
earlier work, the authors write "They are as similar to Dryptosaurus
aquilunguis (Cope) as to Gorgosaurus (i.e. Albertosaurus)" and thus
"show no characteristics that would permit generic
identification."  <br>
ANSP 15319 was originally described by Miller (1967), who compared it
to pedal phalanx III-1 of <i>Struthiomimus</i>. Baird and Horner
(1979) realized it was a more distal phalanx (based on the ginglymoid
proximal articular surface) and referred it to <i>cf.</i> <i>Ornithomimus</i>
as phalanx III-2. They stated it closely resembled other ornithomimids,
but cited <i>Dryptosaurus? macropus</i> (AMNH 2551) as an example,
while it's really a tyrannosauroid. In actuality, ANSP 15319 differs
from pedal phalanx III-2 of ornithomimids in being less elongate and
from III-2 in tyrannosauroids in being less transversely flared
proximally and distally. It is however, almost indistinguishable from
pedal phalanx III-3 in both clades. It is provisionally referred to
Tyrannosauridae here due to size, as it is 24% larger than the largest <i>Gallimimus</i>
specimen, but comparable to a subadult <i>Gorgosaurus</i>.<br>
Horner (1979) lists ANSP 15330 as Carnosauria indet., while it was
described in depth and figured by Baird and Horner (1979).<br>
Note anterior maxilla ANSP 15303 from Phoebus Landing has been
reidentified as <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinosuchus</span>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Specimens assigned to Carnosauria by Hilton (2003) and the LACM online catalog are indicated above with a questionable referral, as the only Late Cretaceous Mexican carnosaurs sensu lato are tyrannosaurids, although it is possible to confuse e.g. dromaeosaurid teeth or ornithomimid pedal elements with the latter family. Note in the early 2000s almost all LACM El Gallo material was transferred to the IGM, but often only placeholder numbers (with letters or  series of small numbers) or no numbers at all have been published yet.<br>
Morris (1967) first reported El Gallo theropod &quot;teeth are the typical compressed, doubly serrate kind that resemble the common late Cretaceous predator <em>Gorgosaurus</em>.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
Molnar (1974) reported &quot;Similar teeth [to <em>Labocania anomala</em>], of maxillary aspect and approximately equal size ... from the &quot;El Gallo Fm.&quot;.&quot;, &quot;a single metatarsal (LACM 28237) which is longer and less stout than that of <em>Labocania</em>&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;may pertain to a tyrannosaurid&quot;, and &quot;a premaxillary tooth (LACM 20886) of typical tyrannosaurid form.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
Morris (1981) reported &quot;Three carnosaur teeth were found associated with LACM 17715&quot; (the holotype of <em>Magnapaulia laticaudus</em>) and &quot;two teeth with ... LACM 17712&quot; (a paratype of that species), which are probably former LACM 17714  considering the specimen number, collector and date.&nbsp; He also stated &quot;teeth and bone fragments of carnosaurs as large as <em>Gorgosaurus</em> or <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> were found more or less randomly throughout the deposits", which correspond to IGM specimens.&nbsp; <br>
Hernandez-Rivera (1997) listed &quot;a tyrannosaurid (cf. <em>Albertosaurus</em>)&quot; from the El Gallo Formation based on all of these specimens.&nbsp; <br>
Rodriguez-de la Rosa and Aranda-Manteca (1999) note a tyrannosaurid tooth type from the El Gallo Formation (tooth UABC FCM coll. according to Ramírez-Velasco and Hernández-Rivera 2015) that was briefly described. <br>
Ford and Chure (2001) described four premaxillary teeth (IGM 4301-4304) as <em>Aublysodon</em>, despite them being serrated while the genus (now thought to be a mix of juvenile tyrannosaurines) was defuned by its unserrated premaxillary teeth.&nbsp; Note they got two of the previous LACM numbers incorrect, with IGM 4303 previously being LACM 28998 not 28999, and IGM 4304 previously being LACM 42570 not 24580 (as listed in Ramírez-Velasco and Hernández-Rivera 2015 and confirmed by the LACM online catalog). Note as well that IGM 4301 and 4302 used to be LACM 20886,  so which of the two teeth was mentioned by Molnar is unknown. Further confusing matters is that Hilton (2003) lists &quot;LACM to Mex. 20886/WJM 7-66-2-5&quot; as a tooth and  Ramírez-Velasco and Hernández-Rivera  list &quot;LACM 20886 (IGM 76625?): tooth&quot; associated with Hilton 2003 and Morris 1967 (in addition to IGM 4301-4302 listed as also previously being LACM 20886).&nbsp; So while it seems likely WJM 7-66-2-5 was the placeholder number for IGM 76625, does it represent yet another tooth previously cataloged as LACM 20886?&nbsp; The fact theropod caudal vertebra LACM 101182 has a crossed out label reading 66167/20886 suggests the latter number included many specimens that have since been separately recatalogued. And since Morris (1967) neither mentions nor figures a particular tooth, and several 'carnosaur' teeth were discovered by him in 1966, how could any particular tooth be associated with that paper?<br>
Metatarsal II LACM 28237 is now IGM 6260 (Peecook et al., 2013). Peecook et al. (2010; 2013) described a new metatarsal IV (IGM 6130) as Tyrannosauridae gen. et sp. indet..&nbsp; They wrote &quot;The metatarsal II (IGM 6260) collected by Morris generally resembles the metatarsal IV (IGM 6130) described herein, but it is longer (480 mm vs. 391 mm) and less robust (RI = 0.3271 vs. 0.3836). Because instances of sympatry among Late Cretaceous tyrannosauroid species are rare and because of the morphological similarities of the two metatarsals, we hypothesize that the metatarsals probably pertain to the same taxon. The size difference suggests that IGM 6260 represents a larger and likely more mature individual than does IGM 6130.&quot; If this were true however, the larger and thus presumably older IGM 6260 might be expected to be more robust, not less.&nbsp; Initially they wrote in their 2010 SVP abstract &quot;The metatarsal was found associated with a nearly complete pedal phalanx and fragments of other phalanges&quot;, but these were not mentioned in the final 2013 paper. <br>
The premaxillary teeth IGM 4301 and 4302 and tooth IGM 76625(?) were found in 1966, 4303 in 1971, and 4304 in 1973, while metatarsal II IGM 6260 was found in 1971 and metatarsal IV IGM 6130 in 2007.&nbsp; <br>
LACM 42565, 42571, 42703 and 57871 are listed on the LACM online catalog as Tyrannosauridae despite only being Theropoda in Hilton (2003).&nbsp; LACM 17701 is (probably mistakenly) not listed as having been transferred to the IGM on the museum's online catalog, despite being given a temporary IGM number in Hilton's list.&nbsp; Among the materials without published final IGM numbers, former LACM 17696-17697, 17701, 17714 and 20889 were found in 1966, 20879 in 1967, 28993 and 28997 in 1971, while 42563-42565, 42571, 42574, 42631, 42638, 42669, 42685, 42687, 42703-42705 and 57871 were found in 1973.<br>
AMNH 7755 is listed on the AMNH online catalog as including &quot;1 tooth 3 vertebrae 2 ends of limb bones femur&quot; of a tyrannosaurid.&nbsp; Carrano (1998) provides femoral measurements as &quot;Tyrannosauridae indeterminate&quot;.

Marsh, 1890<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after Brownstein,
2021) arctometatarsus in which metatarsal III lacks prominent
diaphysial bulge that articulates with II and IV; articular surface for
metatarsal V on metatarsal IV extends distally past proximal expansion;
ventral margin of metatarsal IV flat to concave in side view; no large
concavity along the ventral margin of metatarsal IV just proximal to
distal condyles; loss of groove or pit on lateral surface of distal end
of metatarsal IV.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Marsh (1890) proposed
the family Dryptosauridae for Cretaceous theropods (excluding
ornithomimids, which he assigned to Ornithopoda). The supposed
diagnostic characters are symplesiomorphic for theropods (limb bones
hollow; feet digitigrade; prehensile pedal digits) except for the very
small forelimbs.  When the family was used in the 1900s it was
usually to emphasize the uniqueness of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>
among theropods (e.g. Paul, 1988; Carpenter et al., 1997) rather than
connect it with other genera.  Brownstein (2021) proposed
inclusion of "Cryptotyrannus" in Dryptosauridae with a list of
synapomorphies.<br>

<b>Holotype-</b> (ANSP 9995) (6.4 m; ~750 kg; adult) maxillary
fragment, dentary fragment, surangular fragment, several teeth,
incomplete mid caudal centrum, incomplete mid caudal centrum (115 mm),
partial mid caudal vertebra (115 mm), incomplete distal caudal vertebra
(118 mm), incomplete distal caudal vertebra (118 mm), incomplete distal
caudal vertebra (113 mm), incomplete distal caudal vertebra (108 mm),
incomplete distal caudal vertebra (104 mm), incomplete distal caudal
vertebra (72 mm), two partial distal caudal vertebrae, incomplete
humeri (~300 mm), phalanx I-1 (~160 mm), manual ungual I or II (176 mm
straight), phalanx II-2 (126 mm), phalanx ?-? (48 mm; lost), incomplete
pubes, partial ischium, femur (781 mm), tibia (759 mm), partial fibula,
partial astragalus (161 mm wide), partial metatarsal III <br>
....(AMNH 2438) metatarsal IV (396 mm)<br>
<b>Diagnosis-</b> (after Carpenter et al., 1997) interdenticle spaces
on maxillary teeth half the width of denticles; flexor tubercle of
manual ungual I begins at proximal edge of articular surface and has
minimal ventral projection. <br>
(after Carr, 2005) medioventral heel of metatarsal IV absent.<br>
(after Brusatte et al., 2011) combination of a reduced humerus
(humerofemoral ratio = 0.375) and large hand (phalanx I-1: femur ratio
= 0.200); extremely mediolaterally expanded ischial tubercle, ~1.7
times as wide as the shaft immediately distally; ovoid fossa on medial
surface of femoral shaft immediately proximal to medial condyle,
demarcated anteriorly by the mesiodistal crest and medially by a novel
crest; proximomedially trending ridge on anterior fibular surface
immediately proximal to iliofibularis tubercle; lip on lateral surface
of lateral condyle of astragalus prominent and overlapping the proximal
surface of the calcaneum; metatarsal IV with flat shaft proximally,
resulting in a semiovoid cross section that is much wider
mediolaterally than deep anteroposteriorly.<br>
<b>Comments-</b> The holotype was discovered in 1866. The sacral
vertebrae originally referred to the holotype, and used to suggest the
specimen is immature, are actually protostegid dorsal centra (Cope,
1872). Baird (1979) made them the holotype of <i>Pneumatoarthrus
peloreus</i> (see entry). The caudal vertebrae have closed neurocentral
sutures, suggesting an adult (Carpenter et al., 1997). Four chevrons, a
scapula and supposed sternum were noted/illustrated by Cope, but are
lost. The limb elements of AMNH 2438 are from the holotype locality,
and were thought by Huene (1932) to belong to the same specimen. They
are preserved differently than the holotype though, adding doubt to
this assessment.<br>
Long placed in its own family in an uncertain position among large
theropods, Baird and Horner (1979) placed it in the Tyrannosauridae
based on the tentatively referred femora. Paul (1988) felt it resembled
coelurosaurs the most, and Denton (1990) assigned it to that clade.
Holtz (1996) found it to be a basal coelurosaur as well, next to <i>Deltadromeus</i>
and <i>Bagaraatan</i>, but more basal than tyrannosaurids, <i>Compsognathus,
Ornitholestes</i> and maniraptoriforms. Carpenter et al. (1997)
redescribed the material, noting resemblences to <i>Betasuchus</i>,
doubting its tyrannosaurid affinity, but ultimately preferring to keep
it as Theropoda incertae sedis. Denton (in Carpenter et al., 1997)
however, was still of the opinion <i>Dryptosaurus</i> was a
coelurosaur, perhaps the most basal form in that clade. It came out
basal to all coelurosaurs except <i>Proceratosaurus</i> in Holtz's
(2000) analysis, and as a basal tyrannosauroid (by <i>Stokesosaurus</i>,
less derived than <i>Eotyrannus</i> and tyrannosaurids) in his
unpublished 2001 analysis. Williamson and Carr (2001), Carr and
Williamson (2002), Carr (2005) and Brusatte et al. (2010) found it to
come out as a tyrannosauroid more basal than tyrannosaurids, <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>
and <i>Bistahieversor</i> in their analysis. Brusatte et al. (2011)
redescriobed the material in depth. <br>

Cokeley coll.)".  The latter was donated to the YPM in January
1979.  Holtz (1992) mentions YPM PU 21795 as a referred <i>"Coelosaurus"</i>
specimen, noting it was subarctometatarsalian, more robust than
ornithomimids, and had only a slight ridge on metatarsal IV to back
metatarsal III. He states it does not resemble <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
and regards it as a distinct taxon, though he refrains from naming
it.  Gallagher (1993) listed the metatarsals and all previously
identified eastern North American ornithomimosaur materials as juvenile
<span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>. 
Brownstein (2017) described the metatarsals in detail in a preprint
which never led to a published paper in that journal.  He
concluded it was "a new morphotype and possibly unnamed taxon of
tyrannosauroid" that could be differentiated from <span style="font-style: italic;">Dryptosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span>
and "Teihivenator", but ended up calling it Tyrannosauroidea
indet..  Dalman et al. (2017) independently described the
metatarsals and vertebra, also as Tyrannosauroidea indet., despite
similarly finding "they can be differentiated from other known
tyrannosauroids by the relatively straight proximal articular surface
of metatarsal II" which they believed "most likely represents a basal
condition shared with the Late Jurassic coelurid theropods." 
Brownstein (2021) described the material again, this time as
"Dryptosauridae gen. et sp. nov.?", and seemingly intended to name the
taxon in an earlier draft as the name <span style="font-style: italic;">Cryptotyrannus</span>
overlaps "Merchantville Taxon" in his figure 9 and the material is
listed and discussed as a holotype and paratype.  However, he
ended up deciding to "take a conservative approach by suggesting novel
apomorphies for the Merchantville tyrannosauroid and thus presenting
Dryptosauridae as a multi-species clade while not erecting a new
name."  While not addressed by prior workers, Brownstein (2021)
stated "The caudal vertebra was found close to the metatarsals at the
same locality, and because it belongs to a large theropod of the same
size as the one represented by metatarsals and shows closely comparable
preservation, it most likely belongs to the same individual."

This undescribed material was discovered by Sereno's team during
Dinosaur Expedition 2001. Sereno states the photographed ungual "and
the other bones of the hand we exposed clearly did not belong to the
diminutive forelimb of a tyrannosaur" and that "the bones of this new
predator were extremely fragile" so that further analysis requires
opening and prepapering the field jacket.  The manual ungual
resembles <i>Dryptosaurus</i> most, differing only in the more
extensive area under the lateral groove proximally and possibly the
more anteriorly placed flexor tubercle (assuming the area isn't
broken). Perhaps the two are related.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was collected privately without locality
data, so the exact provenence is unknown. Sereno et al. (2009) list
measurements for two left pedal phalanges III-1, one of which is much
shorter and close to the right III-2 in length so is probably III-2
instead. As the specimen is young, it may be placed too basally in
analyses like Sereno et al.'s and Brusatte et al. (2010) which do not
take into account ontogenetic changes in morphology (Fowler et al.,
2011; Tsuihiji et al., 2011). Fowler et al. (2011) also demonstrate
histology indicates <i>Raptorex</i> was more probably a 2-3 year old
juvenile than a 5-6 year old subadult. Brusatte (2013) states a restudy
of <i>Raptorex</i> and comparison to juvenile <i>Tarbosaurus</i> is

<b>Comments</b>- The name "Appalachiosaurus" was first used online by
Holtz et al. (2004) in the data matrix of their phylogenetic analysis.
None of the South Carolinean material assigned to <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>
by Schwimmer et al. (2015) was done so based on anatomy, and the later
ages of SCSM 98.64.2 and ChM PV6819 suggest they belong to other taxa.<br>
Holtz (2004) found this taxon to be a basal albertosaurine, but after
adding <i>Dilong</i> to his matrix (2005 Burpee Symposium), <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>
ended up basal to Tyrannosauridae, as in Carr et al.'s (2005) and
Carr's (2005) analyses using cranial characters. Most recently,
Brusatte et al. (2010) found it to be sister to Tyrannosauridae. <br>

<b>Comments</b>- At least one family has precedence over
Tyrannosauridae- Deinodontidae (originally misspelled Dinodontidae by
Cope) from 1866, which is based on the genus <i>Deinodon</i>. <i>Deinodon</i>
consists of several teeth of dubious association which are probably
referrable to <i>Gorgosaurus</i> and/or <i>Daspletosaurus</i>.
Deinodontidae was commonly used before the 1950's and Tyrannosauridae
was mostly used after 1970, perhaps based on Russell (1970). Russell
described <i>Deinodon</i> as a 'nomen vanum' (= nomen dubium) and
stated it "is not a useful systematic procedure to perpetuate family
group names based on generically unidentifiable material", but this is
not a rule in the ICZN and the genus has not been reevaluated recently.
<br>
<b>Tyrannosauridae defined</b>- Sereno's (1998) definition of
Tyrannosauridae is problematic, as <i>Nanotyrannus</i> is probably a
junior synonym of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and it seems likely <i>Aublysodon</i>
is a tyrannosaurine. The latter also means Holtz's (2001) definition
would only include tyrannosaurines. Brochu's (2003) definition includes
<i>Alectrosaurus</i>, which is here resolved as far more basal within
Tyrannosauroidea. Holtz (2004) gave Tyrannosauridae two different
definitions in his Dinosauria chapter, presumably on accident. One is
stem-based and would make the family cover several more basal taxa like
<i>Bistahieversor</i>, <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>, <i>Dryptosaurus</i>
and <i>Xiongguanlong</i> (notably Dryptosauridae has priority over
Tyrannosauridae). The other is node-based and is used here. Sereno et
al.'s (2009) definition is a first order redefinition of Holtz's second
definition, after deleting <i>Daspletosaurus</i> and <i>Tarbosaurus</i>.
I agree with Sereno that their inclusion is useless, as none are ever
placed outside (<i>Gorgosaurus</i> + <i>Albertosaurus</i> + <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>),
yet their exclusion is also useless. Brusatte et al. (2011) incorrectly
attributed a definition to Sereno et al. (2005) (perhaps intending the
2009 paper), but did not use <i>Albertosaurus</i> as an internal
specifier. <br>

postorbital boss position adjacent to orbit; posterodorsal margin of
posterior postorbital process is concave; posterior process of
postorbital stops short of posterior margin of laterotemporal fenestra;
medial margin of joint surface for the quadratojugal on the quadrate
extends vertically; ceiling of basisphenoid recess is inflated; dorsal
process of palatine is short; dorsal process of palatine is
anteroposteriorly elongate; dorsal process of palatine extended
vertically; the dorsal margin of the lateral cnemial process extends
anteroventrally at a steep angle; shaft of pedal phalanx I-1 is wide;
ventrally, the joint surface of the lateral condyle of pedal phalanx
I-1 reaches or extends past the posterior margin of the collateral
ligament pit; the ventral margin of the proximal surface of pedal
phalanx IV-2 is trilobate; in dorsal view the distal condyle of pedal
phalanx IV-2 extends into the supracondylar pit. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- This is generally thought to include <i>Gorgosaurus
libratus</i> and perhaps <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>, in addition to <i>Albertosaurus
sarcophagus</i>. Olshevsky (1995) created the tribe Albertosaurini as a
paraphyletic taxon including not only <i>Albertosaurus</i> and <i>Gorgosaurus</i>,
but <i>Daspletosaurus</i> as well. <br>

<b>Comments-</b> Pharris (DML 1996) suggested the name "Albertogorgon
lambei" for several specimens (AMNH 5336, AMNH 5664, FMNH PR308, ROM
1247 and USNM 12814) based on differences Paul (1988) noted between
these and <i>G. libratus</i> (CMN 2120, AMNH 5458, RTMP 85.62.1).
However, the name is unpublished, FMNH PR308 is <i>Daspletosaurus</i>,
<i>sternbergi</i> has priority as the species, and recent studies
(Carr, 1996; Currie et al., 2003; Carr, 2005) have not recognized the
reality of such a taxon. Indeed, in Carr's (2005) specimen-level
analysis, AMNH 5664 was in a clade with the holotype (CMN 2120),
separate from AMNH 5336, 5458 and ROM 1247. This completely mixes
"Albertogorgon" and <i>Gorgosaurus</i> specimens, showing the division
is artificial.<br>
AMNH 5434 was described by Matthew and Brown (1923) as AMNH 5336, which
was repeated in the literature by Russell and others. AMNH 5336 is
actually a <i>Daspletosaurus</i> specimen which was called AMNH 5434
by Matthew and Brown, and later moved to the FMNH as PR308. MOR 557 is
listed by Currie (2003b) as <i>G. libratus</i>, but is on the MOR
website as a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> specimen.<br>
At at talk in Chicago after the Armour Symposium, Currie (2001)
reported skin impressions associated with the holotype of <i>Gorgosaurus</i>,
which lacked scales. Bell et al. (2017) noted "during restoration of
the specimen in the 1980's; however, these were later covered over with
plaster and the moulds taken of the skin could not be relocated at the
time of writing." Some other specimens from Dinosaur Park show this
same morphology. Tanke (DML 1996) reported a small patch of skin
associated with a partial tyrannosaurid skeleton (vertebrae, dorsal
ribs, gastralia, ilium impression, limb bones impressions, astragalus)
from Alberta presumably stored in the RTMP. The tyrannosaurid was ~8-9
m long, and the skin impression (though associated with a gastralium
and ilial impression) could not be placed anywhere specifically on the
body due to the skeleton's disarticulation. It preserved small
reticulate scales similar to hadrosaurids. Tanke also reported
tyrannosaurid skin impressions on MOR specimens. Most recently, Bell et
al. described a skin impression on CMN 11593<br>

<b>Syntypes-</b> (AMNH 3962) (subadult) first maxillary tooth (25 mm)<br>
.... (juvenile) first maxillary tooth (14 mm)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The type teeth (AMNH 3962) are distinctive in being
labiolingually wider than mesiodistally long (13.5 mm vs. 12 mm for the
larger specimen; 8 mm vs. 6 mm for the smaller), and unlike
tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth, the distal carina is median in
position. The mesial carina twists lingually at its base and both
carinae are serrated. These characters are only known in maxillary
tooth 1 of <i>Gorgosaurus</i>, which is present in the same strata
further north. While Lambe (1904) indicates the first dentary tooth of <i>Albertosaurus</i>
is wider than long as well, he also notes this tooth is D-shaped as in
premaxillary teeth. The size indicates they are young specimens.<br>
Cope (1876) later referred a dentary and a premaxillary tooth (AMNH
3963) to this species. He describes one or two anterior teeth (but not
the first dentary tooth, which is D-shaped as in <i>Albertosaurus</i>)
as being transversely uncompressed or even expanded, and lists
measurements for the second tooth as having a labiolingual diameter of
18 mm and a mesiodistal diameter of 13 mm. Cope's measurement may not
have taken into account the rotation of the carinae in tyrannosaurid
anterior dentary teeth though, as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> has a second
dentary tooth only 65% as wide labiolingially as mesiodistally, but it
is rotated to appear transversely broader than long in dorsal view of
the dentary. Currie (2003) later referred this specimen to <i>Gorgosaurus</i>.<br>
Cope (1892) described two specimens (CMN 5600 and 5601) from the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta as further specimens of <i>Laelaps
incrassatus</i>. Lambe (1903, 1904) published more detailed
descriptions of these specimens as <i>Dryptosaurus incrassatus</i>.
The combination was first used by Hay (1902) because <i>Laelaps</i>
was found to be preoccupied and replaced with <i>Dryptosaurus</i> by
Marsh. However, Lambe's (1904) statement that Cope's original teeth and
dentary are more likely <i>Deinodon</i>, making the Horseshoe Canyon
specimens the types of <i>incrassatus</i> is incorrect. The name must
stick with Cope's original holotype teeth. Osborn (1905) recognized
this and created the taxon <i>Albertosaurus sarcophagus</i> for the
Horseshoe Canyon specimens, to distinguish them from the Judith River
type material of <i>incrassatus</i>. <br>

anteromedial palatine process.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype was discovered in 1884, and the paratype
in 1889. The these were initially referred to <i>Laelaps incrassatus</i>
by Cope (1892), which is based on two teeth from the earlier Judith
River Group of Montana. Lambe (1903, 1904) then published more detailed
descriptions of these specimens as <i>Dryptosaurus incrassatus</i>.
The combination was first used by Hay (1902) because <i>Laelaps</i>
was found to be preoccupied and replaced with <i>Dryptosaurus</i> by
Marsh. However, Lambe's (1904) statement that Cope's original teeth and
dentary are more likely <i>Deinodon</i>, making the Horseshoe Canyon
specimens the types of <i>incrassatus</i> is incorrect. The name must
stick with Cope's original Judith River holotype. Osborn (1905)
recognized this and created the taxon <i>Albertosaurus sarcophagus</i>
for the Horseshoe Canyon specimens, to distinguish them from the
Montanan type material of <i>incrassatus</i>. The holotype of <i>Albertosaurus
arctunguis</i> (ROM 807) was discovered in 1923 and described by Parks
(1928), but has since been synonymized with <i>A. sarcophagus</i>
(Russell, 1970). <br>
The Dry Island bonebed was discovered in 1910 and its initial
collections are catalogued as AMNH 5218 and 5226-5235 (Currie, 2000).
Exactly which elements are catalogued as AMNH 5218 differs between
references- Currie lists the non-hindlimb material entered above plus
"two femora, three tibiae, half a fibula, two astragali, one calcaneum,
a pair of associated metatarsals (II-III), six isolated metatarsals, 42
phalanges, and seven unguals", while Eberth and Currie (2010) list two
humeri, three femora, four tibiae, a fibula, two astragali, a
metatarsal I, 37 phalanges and one ungual. At least 26 individuals are
represented (Erickson et al., 2010), and RTMP (98.63, 98.64, 99.50,
2000.45, 2001.45, 2002.45, 2003.45, 2004.56, 2005.50 specimens) and UA
(2006-2010; Eberth and Currie, 2010 specimens above) excavation has
produced over a thousand elements, most of which have yet to be
described (Currie and Koppelhus, 2010; Eberth and Currie, 2010). While
Currie thought a large pedal phalanx III-3 catalogued in AMNH 5218
might be <i>Daspletosaurus</i>, no other evidence of that genus is
present making this highly unlikely. Bell et al. (2017) described the
skin impressions of RTMP 94.186.1. <br>
Osborn (1916) referred AMNH 5255 questionably to <i>Ornithomimus velox</i>,
but this hindlimb is now identified as Tyrannosauridae on the AMNH
online catalogue. It may be <i>Albertosaurus</i> based on provenance,
and is listed as Tetanurae indet. by Carrano (1998). CMN 11315 was
first identified as <i>Daspletosaurus</i> (Russell, 1970), but is <i>Albertosaurus</i>
(Currie, 2003). Bell (2007) first identified the Danek bonebed of the
Hoseshoe Canyon Formation as including <i>Daspletosaurus</i>, though
the material was later found to be <i>Albertosaurus</i> (Bell and
Currie, 2014; Torices et al., 2014). Ford (paleofile.com) lists an RTMP
specimen noted by Rondeau (1995) in a newspaper article under <i>Albertosaurus</i>,
but based on its locality information and Tanke (DML, 1996) this would
seem to be RTMP 91.163.1, which is a <i>Gorgosaurus</i> specimen
according to Currie (2003).<br>
Funston et al. (2020) mention "a possible premaxilla ... from the
Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta" as a possible embryonic
tyrannosaurid (presumably <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span>
based on providence), but this specimen (UALVP coll.) turned out to be
more likely a fragment of embryonic troodontid dentary (Funston pers.
comm.).<br>

<b>Comments</b>- The holotype's repository (verified by Averianov,
pers. comm. 2015) is based on the recent redescription of <i>'Aspideretes'
planicostatus</i> (as <i>Amuremys planicostata</i>) by Danilov et al.
(2002), which was collected by Riabinin in the same locality as <i>periculosus</i>
and described by him in the same paper. Riabinin based the species on
nine teeth with a possibly referred phalanx, and provided the
dimensions of the largest. Thus the <i>periculosus</i> material
consists of syntypes, of which the sole figured specimen should be
designated the lectotype once redescribed. These teeth were discovered
in 1916-1917 and first mentioned by Riabinin (1930a) as <i>Dryptosaurus</i>?
sp. before being described by him (1930b) as a species of <i>Albertosaurus</i>,
based on smaller size than <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and supposedly <i>Gorgosaurus</i>.
Every generic reassignment since has been done in taxonomic lists
without justification, except possibly Olshevsky's (1995) which has not
been translated from Japanese. Lu and Han (2012) referred several teeth
from the same locality to not only tyrannosaurids, but
carcharodontosaurids, <i>Fukuiraptor</i>, carcharodontosaurids and a
possible new theropod. Bolotsky (2013) thought these could all be
tyrannosaurid however. Notably, the Yuliangze Formation continues
across the Amur River into Russia as the Udurchukan Formation of the
Tsagayan Group, which has preserved numerous tyrannosaurid remains.
Alifanov and Bolotsky (2002) refer some of these Russian teeth to <i>periculosus</i>
and <i>Aublysodon</i>, which were later briefly described as
Tyrannosauridae indet. by Bolotsky (2011). Bolotsky (2013) described
Udurchukan tyrannosaurid material in depth in his thesis, comparing
them to Yuliangze teeth as well. He found the smaller Udurchukan and
Yuliangze teeth are comparable and that they are more similar to
albertosaurines than tyrannosaurines. While Bolotsky didn't assign
particular teeth to each subfamily, those which are within his small
range are assigned to <i>periculosus</i> here, though there is some
size overlap. All postcrania (except a metacarpal I) were said to be
albertosaurine-sized, and the cervical mentioned by Alifanov and
Bolotsky (2002) was said to be from a ~6-8 meter long individual. It's
possible at least some of these are from juvenile tyrannosaurines, <i>Alioramus</i>,
or more basal tyrannosauroids. <br>

It does do a better job at maintaining stability if albertosaurines are

agree with Sereno.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Kurzanov, 1976) elongate skull (length/height
ratio &gt;3); 16-17 maxillary teeth (ontogenetic?); 18-20 dentary teeth
(ontogenetic?). <br>
(after Brusatte et al., 2009 for <i>A. altai</i>) accessory pneumatic
fenestra posterodorsal to promaxillary fenestra of maxilla
(ontogenetic?); maxillary fenestra enlarged and 1.9 times longer than
deep; laterally projecting jugal horn; thick ridge on dorsal surface of
the ectopterygoid; anteroposteriorly elongate anterior mylohyoid
foramen of splenial; thin epipophysis on atlantal neurapophysis that
terminates at a sharp point; pneumatic pocket on anterior surface of
cervical transverse processes (ontogenetic?); external pneumatic
foramina on dorsal ribs (ontogenetic?); anterodorsally inclined midline
ridge on the lateral surface of the ilium.<br>
<b>Other diagnoses</b>- Kurzanov (1976) listed many additional
characters, most of which are probably due to the <i>Alioramus</i>
type's juvenile age- 'average' size; elongate snout; series of
prominent nasal rugosities; small postorbital boss; labiolingually
compressed teeth. Two rows of maxillary nutrient foramina are present
in most tyrannosaurids (Currie, 2003), as are the laterosphenoid
contacts noted by Kurzanov (forms part of the supratemporal cavity and
contacts the postorbital). Currie also noted the trigeminal foramen
near certainly contacted the laterosphenoid as opposed to being
completely contained by the prootic. While he defended the prominence
of the nasal rugostities as potentially diagnostic, they are lower in
IGM 100/1844.<br>
Brusatte et al. (2009) stated several characters united the <i>Alioramus</i>
specimens in their analysis, most being previously used by Kurzanov
except for the long posterior squamosal process. Yet Carr (2005) notes
that juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> have long processes, making this
potentially ontogenetic. Among characters listed in the diagnosis for <i>A.
altai</i> which are unknown in the <i>A. remotus</i> holotype, the
palatine pneumatic recess extends posteriorly beyond the posterior
margin of the vomeropterygoid process in juvenile <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> more than in adults. <br>
<b>Comments</b>- The holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus
remotus</span>
was found between 1969-1973 and described by Kurzanov (1976) as a form
of primitive tyrannosaurid.  Currie et al. (2003) found <i>Alioramus</i>
to be the sister taxon of <i>Tarbosaurus</i> because they both lack a
lacrimal process on the nasal, though this is present in <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
as well. In addition, Hurum and Sabath (2003) note <i>Alioramus</i>
and <i>Tarbosaurus</i> share a dentary-angular interlocking mechanism
which makes the mandible rigid. Currie (2003) suggested the specimen
could be a juvenile <i>Tarbosaurus</i> based on skull proportions and
juvenile characters. He stated the prominent nasal rugosities and high
tooth count argue against this, but juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> have
high tooth counts and some juvenile <i>Daspletosaurus</i> and <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
have rows of nasal rugosities, albeit lower ones as in the <i>A. altai</i>
and <i>Qianzhousaurus</i> holotypes. Holtz (2004) recovered <i>Alioramus</i>
in two possible positions- just basal to Tyrannosauridae or sister to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
+ <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. The former position is due to the high tooth
count, low snout and slender dentary, which are all possible juvenile
characters. The latter position was due to the thick parietal nuchal
crest, reduced basal tubera, and posteroventrally directed occipital
region. Carr (2005) recovered <i>Alioramus</i> in an uncertain
position basal to Tyrannosauridae, but this could be due to juvenile
characters. However, the evidence cannot be examined as characters
excluding the taxon from Tyrannosauridae were not given, nor was <i>Alioramus</i>
included in the printed data matrix. Brusatte et al. (2009) found <i>Alioramus</i>
to be a basal tyrannosaurine using an updated version of Carr's matrix,
but importantly coded it as if it were an adult when both morphology
and histology show known specimens are juveniles. Thus its position is
suspect, as similarly aged <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> individuals also
emerge as basal tyrannosaurines if run in a similar matrix (Carr,
2005). The same could be said of Lu et al.'s (2014) analyses adding <i>Qianzhousaurus</i>,
where alioramins emerge either as basal tyrannosaurines or just basal
to Tyrannosauridae, and Brusatte and Carr (2016) who found alioramins
to be the most basal tyrannosaurines. IGM 100/1844 also provides
further evidence for a relationship to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>, as it has a
subcutaneous flange on the maxilla and a deep pneumatic fossa on the
dorsal surface of the posterior centrodiapophyseal lamina, both
otherwise only known in that genus. However, they also noted additional
characters which differ between <i>Alioramus</i> and <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
of the same size (ZPAL MgD-I/29, 31 and 175)- shallow maxilla and
dentary; maxilla less convex ventrally; smaller postorbital boss (not
in the <i>Qianzhousaurus</i> type); postorbital lacks an orbital
process; more dentary teeth; muscular fossa above surangular foramen
faces mostly dorsally; laterally projecting jugal horn (not in the <i>Qianzhousaurus</i>
type); deep pocket behind surangular fenestra; fibular facet of tibia
faces strongly laterally; lateral malleolus of tibia projects less
distolaterally. The first six characters are typical of juveniles and
could potentially indicate <i>Alioramus</i> individuals are larger at
a younger age than ZPAL MgD-I/29 and 31, or that different individuals
acquire adult features at different ages. The jugal horn and surangular
pocket are ornamental and pneumatic features respectively, which show a
high amount of individual variation. Brusatte et al. even state that an
ontogenetic decrease in pneumaticity is known in theropods and that <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
itself is known to lose pneumatic vertebral features with age,
potentially explaining the surangular pocket and some of <i>A. altai</i>'s
supposed diagnostic features (see diagnosis above). Ontogenetic
variation in tyrannosaurid tibiae has not been examined yet. While
Brusatte et al. claimed that ornamentation increases in ontogeny in
dinosaurs, this is not always the case as shown by juvenile
tyrannosaurines with larger nasal rugosities and the newly discovered
ontogenetic changes in <i>Triceratops</i> (?= <i>Torosaurus</i>) and <i>Pachycephalosaurus</i>
(= <i>Stygimoloch</i> and <i>Dracorex</i>). Despite the fact most
differences could be explained by ontogeny and the unique similarities
present in <i>Alioramus</i> and the contemporaneous <i>Tarbosaurus</i>,
the recently discovered specimen named as <i>Qianzhousaurus</i> is as
large as several traditional <i>Tarbosaurus</i> specimens yet retains
an <i>Alioramus</i> morphology. This would seem to indicate the taxa
are distinct after all.<br>
<b><i>Alioramus altai</i></b>- Originally announced in abstracts by
Bever et al. (2009) and Norell et al. (2009), Brusatte et al. (2009)
erected the species <i>Alioramus altai</i> based on a partial skeleton
discovered in 2001 from Tsagan Khushuu. However, the listed diagnostic
characters are problematic. Most are not determinable in <i>A. remotus</i>
(accessory pneumatic fenestra posterodorsal to promaxillary fenestra of
maxilla; maxillary fenestra enlarged and 1.9 times longer than deep;
thick ridge on dorsal surface of the ectopterygoid; palatine pneumatic
recess extending posteriorly beyond posterior margin of vomeropterygoid
process [also in <i>Daspletosaurus sp.</i>]; thin epipophysis on
atlantal neurapophysis that terminates at a sharp point; external
pneumatic foramina on dorsal ribs; anterodorsally inclined midline
ridge on the lateral surface of the ilium [also in some <i>Gorgosaurus</i>,
<i>Daspletosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> specimens]) or
potentially determinable but unreported (anteroposteriorly elongate
anterior mylohyoid foramen of splenial; pneumatic pocket on anterior
surface of cervical transverse processes). The laterally projecting
jugal horn was also coded as present in <i>A. remotus</i>, and
Brusatte et al. (2012) note it may be present in that species based on
Kurzanov's description. Having 20 dentary teeth instead of 18 is within
the range of variation in other tyrannosaurid species. The subcutaneous
flange on the maxilla is known to vary in <i>Tarbosaurus</i>. The
authors themselves note in the supplementary information that some of
the characters they list as distinguishing <i>A. altai</i> from <i>A.
remotus</i> vary within other tyrannosaurid species- anterior process
of quadratojugal terminates posterior to anterior margin of lateral
temporal fenestra; squamosal anterior process extends anterior to
anterior margin of lateral temporal fenestra; epipterygoid not
bifurcated ventrally (which may be due to damage in <i>A. remotus</i>).
The number and prominence of nasal rugosities is highly variable in
tyrannosaurids, so <i>A. remotus</i> having six large rugosities is
not significant compared to <i>A. altai</i>'s three low ones. Finally,
Brusatte et al. list three characters which are size-related in other
tyrannosaurid taxa- 17 maxillary teeth instead of 16; single
dorsoventral groove between basal tubera; tapering anterior process of
the parietals overlapping frontals on the midline. They considered
these potentially diagnostic since the holotypes are similar in size,
but at least the maxillary tooth count and parietal anterior process
morphology are variable in similar-sized specimens. Here the basal
tubera groove is considered individual variation as well, as this has
only been noted to be ontogenetic in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Brusatte et
al. (2012) added two more characters, which are both unknown in <i>A.
remotus</i> as well- dorsally extending and conical lacrimal horn;
ventrally sloping posterior ilial margin. Those authors also noted the
anteroventrally sloping dorsal quadratojugal margin differs from the
horizontal margin of <i>A. remotus</i>, but found this was also
ontogenetic in <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Oddly, though Brusatte et al.
(2012) conclude almost all of their proposed <i>A. altai</i>
autapomorphies cannot be evaluated for <i>A. remotus</i>, are
ontogenetically and/or individually variable in other tyrannosaurids,
they still retain it as a separate species. However, Brusatte (2013)
notes "it is possible, and perhaps probable, that future work on the <i>A.
remotus</i> holotype" in progress by Alifanov, will show the species
are synonymous.  As of Carr et al. (2017), the authors state "we
take the view that <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus altai</span>
is synonymous with <span style="font-style: italic;">A. remotus</span>."<br>
<i><b>Qianzhousaurus sinensis</b></i>- Lu et al. (2014) describe a new
partial skeleton as <i>Qianzhousaurus sinensis</i>, finding it to be
in a trichotomy with <i>Alioramus remotus</i> and <i>A. altai</i>.
They call this clade Alioramini. Most described differences are
acknowledged to be ontogenetic, expected as <i>Qianzhousaurus</i> is
~25% larger than <i>A. altai</i> and <i>A. remotus</i>. Among the
supposed diagnostic characters, the "extremely reduced premaxilla
(maximum anteroposterior length of the main body of the bone is ~2.2%
of the total basal skull length, ...)" cannot be coded in <i>Alioramus
remotus</i> or <i>A. altai</i> as those specimens don't preserve
premaxillae. The fenestrated maxillary pneumatic excavation in the
ascending process cannot be coded in <i>A. remotus</i>, but as <i>A.
altai</i> expresses this as a fossa and details of pneumatic features
are highly variable between individuals, the differences in size, shape
and placement between these specimens ("larger, located further
posteriorly, oriented nearly vertically instead of horizontally" in <i>Qianzhousaurus</i>)
is not considered taxonomically important. Finally, <i>Qianzhousaurus</i>
lacks a vertical ilial ridge unlike <i>A. altai</i>, which is again
unknown in <i>A. remotus</i>. This in itself is here considered
insufficient to diagnose a new taxon, especially as it fails to
distinguish <i>Qianzhousaurus</i> from <i>Alioramus remotus</i>, and
all three specimens are from stratigraphically equivalent horizons. Lu
et al. further use geographic distance to distinguish their genus but
this is surely inconsequential. Given the above, <i>Qianzhousaurus
sinensis</i> is a junior synonym of <i>Alioramus remotus</i>. <br>

Holotype</b>- (UMNH VP 28348 in part) (~9 m; subadult or adult) partial
frontals (~145 mm), dorsal rib fragments, mid caudal central fragment,
three fragmentary centra, metacarpal II (51 mm), ilial fragment,

(McDonald, Wolfe and Dooley, 2021)<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Diagnosis</span>- (after McDonald,
Wolfe and Dooley, 2021) small, tab-like prefrontonasal process;
prefrontolacrimal process is a rugose prominence separated from
prefrontonasal process by striated notch; prefrontonasal process,
prefrontolacrimal process and notch between them are situated on
mediolaterally-broad, dorsoventrally-thick shelf that roofs dorsal end
of vertical prefrontal contact; medial wall of prefrontal contact does
not merge with ventral surface of prefrontonasal process, such that
ventral surface of prefrontonasal process is free and a deep cleft
separates it from the medial wall of the prefrontal contact.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- McDonald et
al., (2018) originally diagnosed <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamoterror</span>
based on two frontal characteristics.  Yun (2020) found that the
first (prefrontonasal and prefrontolacrimal processes are in close
proximity, separated only by a shallow notch) was shared with <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> sp. frontal SDNHM
32701, but that other <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
individuals (e.g. CMN 8506, RTMP 2001.036.0001) lacked it. 
Similarly, Yun found the second character (subrectangular, concave,
laterally projecting posterior part of the postorbital suture,
separated from the anterior part by a deep groove) was shared with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratophoneus</span>
holotype BYU 8120/9396 but not referred specimen UMNH VP 16690. 
Thus these were both considered characters which vary individually in
tyrannosaurines and are not appropriate for diagnoses.  While Yun
used this to declare <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamoterror</span>
a nomen dubium, McDonald et al. (2021) have since suggested new
autapomorphies that are also seen in their new specimen WSC 1027.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- The holotype was
discovered in August 2012.  The supposed pedal phalanx IV-4 is far
too small
to be referred to the same individual and may be a phalanx IV-2 based
on its elongation, either ornithomimid or tyrannosauroid.  This
also
calls into question the referral of most postcranial fragments, which
"were collected as float", although the metacarpal and phalanx IV-2 are
of comprable size.  <br>
Lewis (2006) reports "a tyrannosaurid tooth fragment" from the Allison
Member at microvertebrate locality NMMNH L-5636, also reported as
"Tyrannosauridae indet." by Lewis et al. (2007).  According to the
NMMNH online catalog, this is NMMNH 50064 found in April 2005. 
This may belong to
the co-occuring <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynmamoterror</span>,
which it can be compared with once the new specimen WSC 1027 is
described that preserved teeth.<br>
McDonald et al. (2018) added <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamoterror</span>
to Carr's tyrannosauroid analysis, ending up in a polytomy with
non-alioramin tyrannosaurines and outside <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> plus <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>.  McDonald et
al. (2021) later used their new specimen WSC 1027 to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Dynamoterror</span> as sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">Teratophoneus</span>, with <span style="font-style: italic;">Lythronax</span> the next closest taxon.<br>

named and described by Carr in his thesis (Carr, 2005) before being
officially described by Carr et al. (2011). While Stadtman et al.
(1999) believed the holotype to be two individuals, it only consists of
one. It is resolved in Carr's analysis of cranial characters as a basal
tyrannosaurine. Carr and Williamson (2010) include the taxon in their
phylogenetic analysis as "new genus from Utah", where it also resolves
as a basal tyrannosaurine. Loewen et al. (2013) described referred
specimens and found the genus to be a tyrannosaurine more derived than
a paraphyletic <i>Daspletosaurus</i>, but less so than <i>Bistahieversor</i>,
<i>Lythronax</i>, <i>Tarbosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Most
recently, Brusatte and Carr (2016) recovered it as a basal
tyrannosaurine sister to <i>Nanuqsaurus</i> and outside the <i>Daspletosaurus</i>+<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
clade. <br>

<b>Comments</b>-
Lehman (1985) originally identified tyrannosaurid teeth from the Aguja
Formation of Texas in his thesis.  Standhardt (1986) identified
three partial teeth from there as carnosaurs in his thesis, of which
his Morphotype A (LSUMG V-1375) is here excluded as it lacks mesial
serrations so is more likely dromaeosaurid.  A large incomplete
femur (LSUMG V-1226) referred to Carnosauria incertae sedis is more
likely hadrosaurid based on the lack of an ectocondylar tuber. 
Langston et al. (1989) identified <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> remains from the lower and upper beds of the Aguja Formation of
Texas.  Rowe et al. (1992) stated "at least one large
tyrannosaurid" (TMM coll.) was present at the Terlingua site. <br>
Rowe et al. (1992) identified cf. <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> teeth
(including TMM 43057-314) from the Aguja Formation of Texas. Sankey
(1998) later identified <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> teeth from another area
of that formation, but these and Rowe et al.'s specimens were referred
to Theropoda "family and genus undetermined." They consisted of two
tooth fragments (LSUMG 5483 and 6239) which were similar to <i>Dromaeosaurus</i> except in lacking a lingually twisted mesial carina, and were
reidentified as tyrannosaurid teeth by Sankey et al. (2005).<br>
Lehman and Wick (2013) describe tyrannosaurid remains from the upper
Aguja Formation as the 'Aguja tyrannosaur', stating "although we
consider it unlikely, it is possible that the specimens could pertain
to more than one taxon."  They note premaxillary tooth
TMM 42880-8 lacks serrations, lateral teeth TMM 42880-7 and 45908-2
have labiolingual compression similar to albertosaurines, a high
frontal parietal crest like tyrannosaurines, and gracile hindlimb
elements as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Appalachiosaurus</span> and juvenile albertosaurines.  The frontal morphology is
diagnostic, but the authors err on the side of caution and leave it
unnamed given the controversial taxonomic history of fragmentary
tyrannosauroid specimens.&nbsp; Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024) added frontal TMM 45905-1 to Loewen's tyrannosauroid analysis and recovered it as a teratophoenin in a polytomy with <em>Labocania</em>, <em>Bistahieversor</em> and Two Medicine frontal UCM 55499 based on characters like the thickness, strong ventral convexity  in side view, overlap of frontal on to the lacrimal and similarly developed ventral flanges.<br>
From Mexico, Westgate et al. (2002) reported "tyrannosaurid ... teeth
and limb elements" from Chihuahua, Montellano et al. (2009) cited "a
form of an indetermined tyrannosaurid" from Coahuila and Rivera-Sylva
et al. (2011) reported "one possible tyrannosaurid tooth" from a new
locality in Coahuila.<br>

<strong>Comments</strong>- Yun (2023) described a tyrannosaur frontal (UCM 55499) as cf. <em>Daspletosaurus horner</em>i, but as stated in his Taxonomic referral section &quot;UCM 55499 can be identified as a tyrannosaurine, of which <em>Daspletosaurus horneri</em> is the only known example in the Two Medicine Formation. Therefore, this specimen is probably referable to this taxon.&quot; However Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024) added it to Loewen's tyrannosayroid matrix and recovered it as a teratopheonin in a polytomy with <em>Labocania</em>, <em>Bistahieversor</em> and Aguja frontal TMM 45905-1.<br>

Comments</b>- Discovered May 7, 1998, NMMNH P-7199 is a partial dentary
associated with tooth fragments and a partial vertebra that all remain
unfigured.  Carr and Williamson (2000) refer it "to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span> on the basis of its large apical and midheight denticles, 7.5 denticles
per 5 mm and 8.5 denticles per 5 mm, respectively" on the mesial carina
and note the dentary and vertebra "are too weathered and incomplete to
permit identification."  Jasinski et al. (2011) suggested however
that
"identification below the family level (Tyrannosauridae) based on
denticle densities is tenuous" so retained it as Tyrannosauridae
indet..  The NMMNH online catalog incorrectly lists this as being
from
the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation.<br>
Jasinski et al. (2011) notes "The scapulocoracoid (SMP VP-2105, Fig.
7A-B) may be from an adult as it compares readily in size and
morphology to the scapulocoracoids of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span> (FMNH PR2081; Brochu, 2003, fig. 80). While this indicates the presence
of a large tyrannosaurid in the Naashoibito Member, the specimen cannot
be confidently referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span>, but may represent <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> sp."<br>
Femur SMP VP-1113 is first published as "SMP VP-? femur Naashoibito
Mbr., Kirtland Fm. Tyrannosauridae indet" by Carr and Williamson
(2000), then figured by Lucas and Sullivan (2000) as "Tyrannosauridae,
incomplete femur."  Sullivan et al. (2005) identified it as "cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> sp., based on
comparison with USNM 10754, a right femur of either <span style="font-style: italic;">Gorgosaurus</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> sp. (labelled as <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span> sp.) ... from the Dinosaur Park Formation" because "the size and
morphology of SMP VP-1113 closely resembles that of USNM 10754", but
the only stated character is gracility compared to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>, which is true for
almost all other tyrannosaurids.<br>
Jasinski et al. (2011) figure a metatarsal I (incorrectly called "the
1st phalanx of the 1st metatarsal" on page 226), which along with femur
SMP VP-1113 they state is "from a large tyrannosaurid that seems more
gracile than an adult <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span>, although they may represent a juvenile or sub-adult."<br>
Lehman (1981) wrote "single, complete, right fourth metatarsal (on loan
from the collection of Ronald P. Ratkevich of Alamogordo, New Mexico)
is tentatively referred here to <span style="font-style: italic;">Albertosaurus</span> sp." using the broad concept of the genus popular at the time where it
included <span style="font-style: italic;">Gorgosaurus</span>. 
It is figured in anterior, medial and five sectional views.<br>
Carr and Williamson (2000) reported "a large pedal phalanx (AMNH 5882;
Fig. 4A-F) was collected from the Naashoibito Member of the Kirtland
Formation. The collector and date of collection of this specimen are
unknown" and figured it in multiple views as Tyrannosauridae
indet.. 
Oddly, the AMNH online catalog lists this as being collected by Brown
from the Hell Creek Formation of Snow Creek, Montana, but does
correctly list it as a "2nd phalanx" of Theropoda.  Williamson and
Carr
(2005) referred the phalanx to cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span> in an abstract.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Alamotyrannus" into "Atroxicarius"</span>-
Dalman (2013) stated "the many isolated but diagnostic tyrannosaurid
skeletal fossil elements from the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo
Formation (early Maastrichtian) of northwestern New Mexico (Sullivan et
al. 2005; Jasinski et al. 2011; Dalman and Lucas, in press) provide
evidence for the occurrence of a new taxon of a large tyrannosaurid"
with the in press paper's bibliographic entry naming it "Alamotyrannus
brinkmani." Stuchlik (pers. comm. to Dalman, 7-2018) informs me the
intended holotype was two dentaries, presumedly including ACM 7975 that
was mentioned in Dalman (2013) as "the new Ojo Alamo tyrannosaurid
taxon ACM 7975." Dalman (pers. comm. to Demirjian, 2015) stated the
paper is postponed as more complete remains were discovered, and that
the taxon would receive a different name.  A probable explanation
is
that Dalman and Lucas (2016) briefly described and figured ACM 7975 as
a diagnostic tyrannosaurid under study by Dalman but noted that the
previous referral to the Ojo Alamo Formation was due to its discoverer
Loomis using an old, broader definition for the formation. 
Geographical and preservational data indicated instead that ACM 7975
was probably from the De-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation, so
mixing it with the diagnostic Ojo Alamo elements noted by Dalman (2013)
would make his "Alamotyrannus" concept a chimaera.  Thus Dalman
would want to
describe the diagnostic Kirtland dentary and the diagnostic Ojo Alamo
elements as different taxa, which seems to be the plan based on his
2024 online curriculum vitae. <br>
This lists "Dalman, S.G.,
Jasinski, S.E., Loewen, M.A., Lucas, S.G., Malinzak, D.E., Fiorillo,
A.R., and Currie, P.J. 2024. <span style="font-style: italic;">Atroxicarius

tyrannosaurids in North America. Anatomical Records (in review/in
progress)" under Published Research despite being unpublished as of
9-21-2024 and presumedly referring to The Anatomical Record.  This
would then seem to be the new name of the Ojo Alamo tyrannosaurid,
which the title suggests is related to <span style="font-style: italic;">Bistahieversor</span> in a new tribe "Bistahieversorini", although note Dalman misspelled it
without the first 'e'. The tribe, genus and species are obviously
invalid pending this publication as his online curriculum vitae is not
"issued for the purpose of providing a public and permanent scientific
record" (IZCN Article 8.1.1), "produced in an edition containing
simultaneously obtainable copies by a method that assures 8.1.3.1.
numerous identical and durable copies (see Article 8.4), or 8.1.3.2.
widely accessible electronic copies with fixed content and layout"
(Article 8.1.3), does not "state the date of publication in the work
itself, and" is not "registered in the Official Register of Zoological
Nomenclature (ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the
work itself that such registration has occurred" (Articles 8.5.2 and
8.5.3), the taxa are not "accompanied by a description or definition
that states in words characters that are purported to differentiate the
taxon" (Article 13.1) or "explicitly indicated as intentionally new"
(Article 16.1) and even a correctly spelled "bistahieversorine" is not
in Latinized form (article 11.7.2) nor is it "accompanied by citation
of the name of the type genus" (Article 16.2).  Based on another
Dalman
et al. (in review/progress) citation in Dalman's curriculum vitae, the
De-na-zin tyrannosaurid will be named "Denazinosaurus sicarius" and
preseumedly includes dentary ACM 7975 as the intended holotype.<br>
It's unknown which specimens will be types of "Atroxicarius", but as
Dalman (2013) cited skeletal (not dental, which are generally
undiagnostic) elements described by Sullivan et al. (2005) and Jasinski
et al. (2011), they plausibly include dentary and vertebra NMMNH
P-7199, scapulocoracoid SMP VP-2105, femur SMP VP-1113, metatarsal I
SMP VP-1848, a metatarsal IV from the private Ratkevich collection,
and/or pedal phalanx AMNH 5882. <br>

  as a new species of <i>Daspletosaurus</i>. Carr and Williamson (2002)
  and Carr (2005) found <i>Bistahieversor</i> to be the sister taxon of
  Tyrannosauridae based on cranial characters. Carr and Williamson later
  (2010) officially described the taxon and using a matrix similar to
  Carr's (2005) but with more postcranial characters, found it to be in a
  polytomy with <i>Dryptosaurus</i>, <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>, <i>Alioramus</i> and Tyrannosauridae. More recently, Brusatte et al. (2010) found it to
  be sister to <i>Appalachiosaurus</i>+Tyrannosauridae. <br>

  <b>Diagnosis-</b> (after Molnar, 1974)  quadrate massive (transversely thick pterygoid process) (unknown in <em>L. aguillonae</em>); quadrate has almost cylindrical mandibular condylar surface lacking intercondylar groove (also in <em>Shaochilong</em>; unknown in <em>L. aguillonae</em>); mandibular condyle of quadrate inclined at about 45 degrees to  long axis of element (articular surface extends for proximally onto anterior surface  and is not visible  in posterior view) (unknown in <em>L. aguillonae</em>).<br>
  (after 
  Rivera-Sylva and Longrich, 2024) moderate medial projection of postorbital onto dorsolateral surface of postorbital process of frontal, such that postorbital moderately overlaps anterior postorbital facet of frontal.<br>
  Rivera-Sylva and Longrich also state in the text- frontal postorbital process somewhat triangular (also in <em>Bistahieversor</em>).&nbsp; Note these frontal characters are both plesiomnorphies compared to <em>L. aguillonae</em>.<br>
  <strong>Other diagnoses</strong>- Molnar (1974) diagnosed it based on its frontals being massive and thick, maintaining thickness in their anterior portion, but Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024) write &quot;similar thickening is seen in&quot; ... &quot;other teratophoneins, including ... the Aguja tyrannosaurid [TMM 45905-1], <em>Teratophoneus curriei</em>, and <em>Dynamoterror dynastes</em>; thick frontals also occur in <em>Tarbosaurus</em>.&quot; Similarly, Molnar believed the supratemporal fossa does not extend onto the dorsal surface of thr frontal, but Rivera-Sylva and Longrich found &quot;the dorsal surface of the bone is weathered, such that the thin outermost layer of the cortex has peeled away in all but a few place&quot; so that &quot;The scar for the supratemporal fossa appears to have simply been eroded away.&quot;&nbsp; Molnar thought the supposed dentary &quot;had a prominent lateral shelf, now missing, and only represented by its base&quot;, but Rivera-Sylva and Longrich determined &quot;the 'lateral shelf' of the 'dentary' is the palatal shelf of the maxilla&quot;. This also invalidates Molnar's proposed character &quot;Dentary massive&quot;. Finally Molnar included &quot;Ischium resembling that of the Tyrannosauridae&quot; in his diagnosis (M. flexor tibialis internus 3 scar on proximolateral surface, triangular obturator process; &quot;not clearly distinguishable from the corresponding portions of the ischia of <em>Gorgosaurus libratus</em>&quot;), but this no longer works if <em>Labocania</em> IS a tyrannosauroid.<br>
  <b>Comments-</b> Discovered in summer 1970, this was initially reported from the La Bocana Roja Formation (Molnar, 1974).&nbsp; However, Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024) found &quot;The age and stratigraphic position of IGM 5307 are not well-constrained&quot;, with the locality possibly being from the overlying El Gallo Formation (itself probably Middle-Late Campanian).&nbsp; They conclude &quot;Resolving this issue is not possible with the available data and will likely require further fieldwork on the stratigraphy of the site and/or the age of the La Bocana Roja Formation.&quot; Molnar reported &quot;a fragment probably of a dentary&quot; but Rivera-Sylva and Longrich determined &quot;no dentary is present, the element identified as the dentary being the other maxilla.&quot;&nbsp; Teeth have 10-14 serrations per 5 mm mesially and 11-14 distally.&nbsp; Chure (2000) provided the new number for the specimen upon transfer to the IGM.&nbsp;Hilton (2003) lists the  specimen number as LACM to Mex. 20877/JHG 65, apparently a temporary number before becoming officially recataloged at the IGM. Rivera-Sylva and Carpenter (2014)  illustrate the cranial material in lateral view while Ramírez-Velasco and Hernández-Rivera (2015) figure the skeleta; reconstruction including a postacetabular fragment not mentioned by Molnar and place the pedal phalanx as II-2.&nbsp; Rivera-Sylva and Longrich state &quot;A full redescription of <em>Labocania</em> is currently underway&quot; and provide commentary on its anatomy while figuring the frontal in four views.&nbsp; They also report &quot;The distal end of a tibia is preserved.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
  Peecook et al. (2020) mention 
  &quot;An undescribed partial metatarsal, likely metatarsal III, referred to <em>Labocania</em> [that] is slightly larger and more robust than the 'El Gallo' metatarsal [tyrannosaurid IGM 6130], but it is too fragmentary and poorly preserved to make more detailed comparisons.&quot;<br>
  <strong>Relationships</strong>- <em>Labocania</em> was originally referred to Theropoda incertae sedis and compared
  favorably to tyrannosaurids, <i>Indosaurus</i>, <i>Shaochilong</i> (as <em>Chilantaisaurus maortuensis</em>) and a possible metriacanthosaurid dentary from the Kalaza Formation
  (IVPP V903; described by Young and Sun 1957 as cf. <em>Szechuanosaurus campi</em>) (Molnar, 1974).&nbsp; <em>Shaochilong's</em> frontals were said to &quot;particularly resemble those of <em>Labocania</em> in that both lack the anterior shelf of the supratemporal fossa. There is also a medial rise in level of the dorsal surface ..., presumably representing the anterior end of a sagittal crest, similar to, but smaller than, that of <em>Labocania</em>.&quot;&nbsp; However, restudy of <em>Shaochilong</em> by Brusatte et al. 2009 has shown the taxon actually has supratemporal fossae on its frontals, while the surface in <em>Labocania</em> has eroded away (see below).&nbsp; The two do seem to share a quadrate intercondylar groove that &quot;appears to be reduced or absent.&quot;&nbsp; <em>Indosaurus</em> was noted to also have reportedly thick frontals, &quot;from the illustrations [appearing] to be wider and thicker in its posterolateral portion than that of <em>Labocania</em>. However, the <em>Indosaurus</em> frontals are incomplete anteriorly, thus probably appearing wider than they actually were, and may be preserved with a portion of the postorbitals posteriorly (sutures could not be distinguished on the specimen), thus appearing thicker, perhaps, posterolaterally than they actually were.&quot;&nbsp; The latter possibility seems to be false at least, as Novas et al. 2004 more recntly upon examination of the specimen found the postorbital articular surface to be present.&nbsp; In any case, Molnar earlier noted that &quot;the frontal of <em>L. anomala</em> is not so much greater in maximal thickness as it is in average thickness&quot; because the anterior portion is thicker than <em>Allosaurus</em> and tyrannosaurids, so posterolateral thickness in <em>Indosaurus</em> would not be strictly comparable. Regarding the supposed lateral dentary shelf, Molnar states &quot;Such a lateral shelf is not unkown in theropods, having been described for at least one other, cf. <em>Szechuanosaurus campi</em> from Sinkiang, (Young and Sun, 1957, fig. 2)&quot;, referring to IVPP V903.&nbsp; Notably, Rivera-Sylva and Carpenter (2024) have more recently found the shelf in <em>Labocania</em> to be a maxillary palatal shelf, so this lone shared feature is no longer valid.&nbsp; Molnar concluded &quot;The three genera which seem most closely to resemble <em>Labocania</em> in cranial characters, <em>Chilantaisaurus</em>, <em>Indosaurus</em> and <em>Szechuanosaurus</em>, are generally classified as members of the family Megalosauridae (e.g. Steel, 1970)&quot; but correctly noted both that this &quot;often means only that the included genera are large theropods not obviously belonging to the family Tyrannosauridae&quot; and that &quot;It is also not clear, and was not clear to the describers, Young and Sun, that the dentary fragment from Sinkiang actually pertains to <em>Szechuanosaurus</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Thus &quot;the taxonomic position of these three forms is itself considerably less clear than one could wish. Because of this, and because of the general resemblance of the postcranium of <em>Labocania</em> to those of the tyrannosaurids, I have not assigned <em>Labocania</em> to a family.&quot;&nbsp; More recently, <em>Indosaurus</em> is recognized as an abelisaurid while <em>Shaochilong</em> is a carcharodontosaurid or basal tyrannosauroid, but only <em>Shaochilong</em> really shares uncommon characters with <em>Labocania</em> anyway.&nbsp; In retrospect, Molnar described the vast majority of characters as resembling tyrannosaurids or not being more similar to other theropods, with the exception of those few discussed above, its mesial dentition being &quot;not so markedly U-shaped in cross-section&quot; (matching posterior premaxillary teeth of <em>Deinonychus</em>) and the quadrate's inferred posteroventral slope (being like <em>Ceratosaurus</em> and <em>Shaochilong</em>, but more developed).<br>
  Paul
  (1988) referred it to his Allosauridae and Allosaurinae, both paraphyletic to
  tyrannosaurids in his scheme, with <em>Labocania</em> closer to the latter than <em>Acrocanthosaurus</em>, <em>Chilantaisaurus</em> (incl. <em>Shaochilong</em>) and <em>Indosaurus</em>.&nbsp; In this way, the genus was close to each named taxon Molnar made positive comparisons to.&nbsp; He stated the &quot;the short backward-sloping ... quadrate&quot; and supposed lack of D-shaped premaxillary teeth were plesiomorphies shared with <em>Allosaurus</em> instead of tyrannosaurids.<br>
  Chure (2000) believed <em>Labocania</em> to be sister to <em>Shaochilong</em> (as &quot;Alashansaurus&quot;) based on Molnar's characters plus the thick frontal (which Molnar could not verify for <em>Shaochilong</em>), and placed both as tyrannosauroids (based on <em>Shaochilong</em>'s characters) in Holtz's 1994 tyrannosaur +
  ornithomimosaur + troodontid clade (based on the M. flexor tibialis internus 3 scar on the ischium).&nbsp; <br>
  Lamanna (pers. comm., 8-2005) noted the 
  non-rooted teeth may have been left by scavengers and are not associated with any premaxilla in any case, so whether <em>Labocania</em> had D-shaped premaxillary teeth like tyrannosauroids is unknown.&nbsp; Furthermore, based on personal examination the quadrate's anatomy is so unusual and the element so incomplete that he questioned its identification.<br>
  Rivera-Sylva and Carpenter (2014) consider the taxon a tyrannosaurid, similar to Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024) who say &quot;In all observable features the anatomy of <em>Labocania anomala</em>, IGM 5307, is wholly consistent with referral to Tyrannosauridae, and specifically to Tyrannosurinae and the tribe Teratophoneini. Referral to another clade such as Abelisauridae or Carcharodontosauria is not supported by any available evidence, and would be inconsistent with the known distribution of these groups.&quot;&nbsp; They added <em>Labocania anomala</em> and <em>L. aguillonae</em> to a version of Loewen's tyrannosauroid matrix and recovered them as teratophonein tyrannosaurids in a polytomy with <em>Bistahieversor</em>, Aguja frontal TMM 45905-1 and Two Medicine frontal UCM 55499. Furthermore, they found &quot;forcing it into Allosauridae required an additional 14 steps [and] forcing it into Ceratosauria required an additional 15 steps&quot;, although this was not a powerful test as only <em>Ceratosaurus</em> was included among ceratosaurs and only <em>Sinraptor</em> and <em>Allosaurus</em> among allosauroids, with no abelisaurids, carcharodontosaurids or <em>Shaochilong</em> in particular.&nbsp; Similarly, the latter genus is more like <em>Labocania</em> and tyrannosaurids in some features said to differ between <em>Labocania</em> and carcharodontosaurs in the text (strong maxillary sculpturing absent; frontals unfused?- Chure, 2000; orbital notch in frontal; broad orbitosphenoid-frontal contact) and if it is a tyrannosauroid (as in e.g. Rauhut et al., 2024) then the triangular obturator process and tall, broad astragalar ascending process of <em>Labocania</em> would not preclude a close relationsip either.&nbsp; The being said, the only remaining similarity between the two not found in tyrannosaurids is the apparent lack of the quadrate intercondylar groove and perhaps posterodistally sloping quadrate (Rivera-Sylva and Longrich merely say &quot;The quadrate is poorly preserved. We were unable to identify any features that preclude referral to Tyrannosauridae&quot; without commenting on the reality of its supposedly odd features), so there isn't much reason to support that sister group now anyway.&nbsp; As noted above even Molnar's original description almost completely consisted of similarities to tyrannosaurids or differences not shared with other theropods, so with Lamanna's valid point against the lack of D-shaped premaxillary teeth added to the argument, the vast majority of evidence supports a tyrannosaurid <em>Labocania</em>.<br>

  ?(CPC 3078-3091) numerous teeth
  (to ?x31x? mm)<br>
  <strong>Diagnosis</strong>- (after 
  Rivera-Sylva and Longrich, 2024; autapomorphies only) strongly convex anteroventral margin of  lacrimal (unknown in <em>L. anomala</em>); subocular process of lacrimal along anteroventral margin of  orbit relatively dorsally placed (unknown in <em>L. anomala</em>);  broad anteromedial extension of supratemporal fossa extending onto frontal (unknown in <em>L. anomala</em>); strong medial projection of postorbital onto dorsolateral surface of postorbital process of frontal, such that postorbital strongly overlaps anterior postorbital facet of frontal.<br>
  Rivera-Sylva and Longrich also state in the text- frontal postorbital process very triangular.<br>
  <strong>Comments</strong>- This was discovered in 2000. In addition to the elements in the materials list, Rivera-Sylva and Longrich's (2024) skeletal reconstruction includes a partial angular not mentioned in the text, while the distal fibula is not in the materials list. The ischium is a right element, as in stated in Figure 6 but contra the materials list.&nbsp; Rivera-Sylva and Longrich estimate the femoral length as 700 mm on pages 249 and 256, and 710 mm in Figure 14's caption. They note the paratypes &quot;do not overlap with the holotype but are referred (albeit tentatively) to as <em>Labocania aguillonae</em> based on provenance and the autapomorphies of the dentition shared with the closely related <em>Labocania anomala</em>&quot;, referring to their 8-shaped basal section.&nbsp; Rivera-Sylva and Longrich state &quot;The small size of the animal, the presence of extensive striated bone, and the lack of fusion between neural arches and vertebral centra  suggest CPC 2974 was immature at the time of death, although the relatively rugose bone of the maxilla, nasals, and lacrimal are consistent with a subadult or young adult.&quot;<br>

<b>Aublysodontinae</b> Nopcsa, 1928<br>
<b>Definition</b>- (<i>Aublysodon mirandus</i> &lt; <i>Tyrannosaurus
rex</i>) (modified from Holtz, 2001)<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Paul (1988) used this taxon to encompass <i>Aublysodon
mirandus</i>, <i>A. molnari</i> (a juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>), <i>Shanshanosaurus</i>
(a juvenile <i>Tarbosaurus</i>) and potentially the yet unnamed <i>Archaeornithoides</i>
as well. Holtz (1997, 2001) found <i>Aublysodon</i> (based on <i>A.
molnari</i>) and <i>Alectrosaurus</i> (based partially on IGM 100/50
and 100/51, which are not <i>Alectrosaurus</i> and are probably
juveniles) to clade with OMNH 10131 (a specimen described as <i>Aublysodon</i>
but now referred to <i>Bistahieversor</i>). Currie (2000) assigned
both <i>Aublysodon</i> and <i>Alectrosaurus</i> to the subfamily. Yet
the characters used to group these taxa together (unserrated
premaxillary teeth; premaxillary teeth with lingual ridge) are found in
all juvenile tyrannosaurines (Currie, 2003; Carr and Williamson, 2004).
Aublysodontinae is therefore a polyphyletic taxon made of juvenile
tyrannosaurids. Holtz's (2001) phylogenetic definition could include
the <i>Daspletosaurus</i> stem if <i>A. mirandus</i> is in fact a <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
specimen. This is based purely on stratigraphy though, and as the
lectotype is indistinguishable from presumedly <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
juvenile premaxillary teeth, it is inappropriate to use it to define a
clade to the exclusion of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. <i>A. mirandus</i>
may even be outside the <i>Daspletosaurus</i> + <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
clade, or closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> than to <i>Daspletosaurus</i>.<br>

fourteen teeth and tooth fragments discovered in the Judith River Group
of Montana. Most were lateral teeth he regarded as different from <i>Megalosaurus</i>
only in their greater labiolingual thickness, but Leidy placed his
species in the new genus <i>Deinodon</i> because of several other
teeth which he felt were distinctive. These were ANSP 9531, 9533, 9534
and 9535, which can all now be recognized as tyrannosaurid anterior
teeth. Cope (1866) described the teeth of <i>Deinodon</i> as D-shaped,
referencing 9533-9535, to distinguish them from his new taxon <i>Laelaps</i>
(later renamed <i>Dryptosaurus</i>). This makes him first reviser of
the genus, and connected the name <i>Deinodon horridus</i> to the
D-shaped teeth in Leidy's syntype series. Cope considered the lateral
teeth to belong to <i>Laelaps</i>. Leidy (1868) created the new taxon <i>Aublysodon
mirandus</i> for ANSP 9533-9535, intending to retain <i>Deinodon
horridus</i> for the lateral teeth (at least ANSP 9530, 9536 and
9541-9543). Cope's 1866 specification of <i>Deinodon</i> for the
D-shaped teeth has priority though, making <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i>
an objective junior synonym of <i>Deinodon horridus</i>. Marsh (1892)
followed Leidy's (1868) assignment of D-shaped teeth to <i>Aublysodon</i>,
and considered ANSP 9535 to be typical of <i>A. mirandus</i>, while
ANSP 9533 and 9534 were considered examples of another unnamed <i>Aublysodon</i>
species. <i>A. mirandus</i> was notable for its lack of serrations
compared to 9533 and 9534. This made ANSP 9535 the lectotype of <i>Aublysodon</i>,
which was formalized by Carpenter (1982). ANSP 9533 and 9534 are thus
implicitly the remaining syntypes of <i>Deinodon</i> (see entry).
Lambe (1902) referred ANSP 9535 to <i>Struthiomimus</i>, while Osborn
(1905) and Lambe (1917) thought it was probably not referrable to <i>Deinodon</i>.
Since Carpenter's (1982) designation of it as the lectotype of <i>Aublysodon</i>,
the latter genus has been most often regarded as a taxon of basal
tyrannosauroids or more recently as an unnatural assemblage of juvenile
tyrannosaurid remains. It is a tyrannosaurid premaxillary tooth, being
D shaped and labiolingually wider than long (by 141% at the base). Both
carinae are unserrated and the lingual face has a broad ridge running
vertically. The lack of serrations is also seen in the premaxillary
teeth of juvenile <i>Daspletosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
(LACM 28471), while vertical ridges are present in <i>Gorgosaurus</i>
and juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> as well. Based on stratigraphy, this
is probably a juvenile <i>Daspletosaurus</i> tooth (Currie, 2005).
However, while <i>Daspletosaurus</i> has been found in the equivalent
Oldman, Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine Formations, it has yet to be
reported from the Judith River Formation of Montana. There is thus no
particular species of <i>Daspletosaurus</i> <i>A. mirandus</i> can be
referred to, and as it is indistinguishable from juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
teeth, <i>Aublysodon</i> is a nomen dubium within Tyrannosaurinae. For
this reason, it is not a senior synonym of <i>Daspletosaurus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Varricchio and Currie (1991) announced MOR 590 as "a
well preserved tyrannosaurid skull and associated leg are identified as
<span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>"
found "during the last few field seasons."  The taxon was noted by
Horner et al. (1992) as "an intermediate tyrannosauirid (represented by
three specimens) [which] has cranial characters that suggest an
evolutionary position between <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
from the Judith River Formation and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
from the Hell Creek Formation."  The specimen number MOR 590 was
first published in Carr (1999) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">torosus</span>
for a cast of its maxilla.  Only brief details were released
regarding the taxon for the next two and a half decades, though it was
generally recognized as a new species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>.  It was
finally described and named <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosauruis
horneri</span> by Carr et al. (2017).  However, this paper has no
mention of ZooBank
and as of December 1 2024 <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
"horneri" lacks an entry on the ZooBank website.  Thus
according to ICZN Article 8.5.3 (an electronic work must "be
registered in the Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature
(ZooBank) (see Article 78.2.4) and contain evidence in the work itself
that such registration has occurred"), <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> "horneri" Carr et
al., 2017 is a nomen nudum that will only be technically valid
pending action on behalf of the authors or ICZN as its journal is not
published physically. <br>
MOR 1130 was found in 1992 (Hoepfner, 2017 online), but not excavated
until 2000-2001.  It was first mentioned by Scherzer (2008) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> and was briefly
noted in a few papers before being described as a paratype of <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> "horneri" by Carr et
al. (2017).<br>
Carr and Williamson (2000) first noted AMNH 5477 as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> maxilla.  It
was later described by Delcourt (2017) as <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> sp., though Carr et
al. (2017) listed a postorbital and parietal as also preserved and
referred it to <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span>
"horneri."  <br>
Yun (2023) described a tyrannosaur frontal (UCM 55499) as cf. <em>Daspletosaurus horneri</em>, but this was more recently recovered as a teratopheonin in Loewen's tyrannosauroid matrix by Rivera-Sylva and Longrich (2024).<br>
Horner et al. (1992) thought MOR 590 was transitional between <i>Daspletosaurus
torosus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, while Holtz (2001) recovered
it in three possible positions- basal tyrannosaurine, sister to <i>Daspletosaurus
torosus</i> and sister to <i>Tarbosaurus</i> + <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. 
Loewen et al. (2013) and the Bayesian analysis of Brusatte and Carr
(2016) recover this as closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> than <i>Daspletosaurus</i>,
but the parsimony analysis of the latter paper places it as sister to a
<i>D. torosus</i>+DPF OTU. Most recently, Carr (2005), Carr and
Varricchio (2014) and Carr et al. (2017) recovers it sister to a <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus torosus</span>
concept that includes Dinosaur Park Formation specimens.  They
note it may be a descendant of the latter but was not ancestral to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>.  <br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Miyashita et al., 2013) dorsal process of
premaxilla extending posteriorly for more than half the diameter of the
external naris; lacrimal that is 1.5 times anteroposteriorly longer
than dorsoventrally tall; pronounced temporal margin of postorbital.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other diagnoses</span>- while
Miyashita et al. (2013) claimed "a maxillary tooth count greater than
15" distinguished the Dinosaur Park taxon (based on TMP 2001.36.1) from
<span style="font-style: italic;">D. torosus</span>, 15 teeth are
present in FMNH PR308 and the <span style="font-style: italic;">D.
wilsoni</span> type.<br>
Warshaw and Fowler (2022) use "a rostrocaudally elongate and
dorsoventrally narrow mylohyoid foramen of the splenial" to diagnose <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>, but this is absent in
CMN 11594, FMNH PR308 and RTMP 94.143.1.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- Currie (2003) noted specimens of <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
from the Dinosaur Park Formation appear to represent a distinct species
from the holotype of <span style="font-style: italic;">D. torosus</span>,
citing a paper in preperation by Currie and Bakker. Miyashita et al.
(2013) elaborate using RTMP 2001.36.1 as their example of the new
species.  As this is from the Oldman Formation, a simple Oldman
vs. Dinosaur Park separation wouldn't seem to apply and thus the
referral of most Dinosaur Park specimens to this species above should
be
considered temporary pending a more detailed review.  Loewen et
al. (2013) recover this taxon as just basal to <i>Daspletosaurus</i>+<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>,
but it has not been separated from <i>D. torosus</i>
in most other analyses.  Warshaw and Fowler (2022) used BDM 107,
found in 2017 from the Judith River Formation (at a position which
"likely ... corresponds in age to the lower to middle part of the
Dinosaur Park Formation"), as the holotype of a new <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> species separate
from <span style="font-style: italic;">D. torosus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span> "horneri"- <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>.  They listed
characters shared between <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>
and the Dinosaur Park taxon to the exclusion of <span style="font-style: italic;">D. torosus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span> "horneri", and wrote "these
features suggests a close affinity between <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>
and the Dinosaur Park taxon, although this could reflect either
taxonomic synonymity or a genuine sister relationship; this designation
is reserved for future studies centered on the Dinosaur Park taxon
(noted as forthcoming by Currie (2003) and Paulina Carabajal et al.,
2021), which has yet to receive a formal description and may reveal
autapomorphies (or synapomorphies with <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>) not considered
here."  This site provisionally accepts the hypothesis the
Dinosaur Park taxon is <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>. 
Warshaw and Fowler recover <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>
as closer to <span style="font-style: italic;">D</span>. "horneri" and
other tyrannosaurines than to <span style="font-style: italic;">D.
torosus</span> based on Carr's analysis, proposing an anagenetic series
that would lead to <span style="font-style: italic;">wilsoni</span>
and "horneri" needing new genus names or a paraphyletic <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>.<br>
AMNH 5336 was described by Matthew and Brown (1923) as AMNH 5434, which
was repeated in the literature by Russell and others. It was later
moved to the FMNH as PR308. AMNH 5434 is actually a <i>Gorgosaurus</i>
specimen which was called AMNH 5336 by Matthew and Brown. <br>
SDNHM 32701 is a frontal probably discovered in the 1910s and purchased
in 1921 (Yun, 2020b).  It was listed as <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> sp. by Currie, 2003)
and fully described by Yun (2020b) as <span style="font-style: italic;">D.
torosus</span> because he assigned both Oldman and Dinosaur Park
specimens to that species.<br>
Discovered in 1997 and excavated through at least 2002, the TA.1997.002
specimens are from a single bonebed, representing at least three
individuals (Currie et al., 2005). It's uncertain which individuals
TA.1997.002.516, 838, 1383 or the vertebrae and ribs belong to. 
Preliminarily described as <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
sp., Currie et al. state it "likely represents the same species" as <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span> "horneri" from the same
formation "although further study and description of <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span> will be necessary
before the species can be determined with certainty." 
Interestingly, now that <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span>
"horneri" has been described, TA.1997.002 instead seems to share
characters with <span style="font-style: italic;">D. torosus</span>
plus <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span>.  In
particular, the
maxillary fenestra is longer than tall, the upper half of the lacrimal
orbital margin is convex, the lacrimal horn is tall, the dorsal margin
of the posterior postorbital process is convex, and the surangular
shelf overhangs the posterior foramen.<br>

they were discovered in (not mentioned by Carr).<br>
Hwang and Claire (2010) mention identifying a tooth UCMP 150589 as <i>Daspletosaurus</i>,
but the UCMP online database lists it as a hadrosaur, so this may be a
typo.<br>

nicknamed Pete III, was discovered in 2005 (Maltese,
2009).  As of 2018 it is on display at the Cincinnati Museum
Center
(Maltese, 2018 online).  While undescribed, most of the preserved
bones
are photographed on the RMDRC blog.  Unfortunately, few cranial
elements are preserved and the postcrania of <span style="font-style: italic;">D.</span> "horneri" remain
unillustrated and undescribed aside from measurements.  Of listed
differences between <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>
species, Pete III does have
'anteroventral margin of quadrate's orbital process extends along a
steep 45-degree angle' supposedly shared with "horneri", while <span style="font-style: italic;">torosus</span>
shows a shallow angle.  The quadratojugal lacks a lateral
pneumatic
foramen unlike adult "horneri" specimen MOR 1130, which Pete III is
larger than (qj height ~229 mm vs. ~199 mm), but the variation of this
feature is unknown, as its apparent absence in the smaller subadult
"horneri" intended holotype (qj height 151.4 mm) could easily be
individual difference instead of ontogenetic difference.  The
jugal
does lack <span style="font-style: italic;">Thanatotheristes</span>'
autapomorphic transversely rounded orbital
margin.  It is here referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carr, 2005) maxillary fenestra extends
anteromedial to the anterior margin of the antorbital fossa; antorbital
fossa reaches maxillonasal suture with elongate contact; accessory
pneumatic foramen in anterior lacrimal process is distal in position;
joint surface for the quadratojugal on the jugal extends anteriorly
from the ventral jugal margin; posterodorsal jugal process extends
posterodorsally; lingual bar of the dentary flanks anterior two
alveoli; oval scar of the femur is on the posteromedial edge of the
bone; the indentation of the lateral cnemial process of the tibia is
anterior to the midlength of the process; the posteroventral heel of
the calcaneum is short or absent.<br>
<b>Comments</b>- This clade was called <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> by several
authors (Carpenter, 1992; Holtz, 2001; Carr, 2005), but the present
consensus (Currie et al., 2003; Hurum and Sabath, 2003; Holtz, 2004;
Brusatte et al., 2010; Loewen et al., 2013; Brusatte and Carr, 2016) is
to retain <i>bataar</i> and <i>rex</i>
in separate genera.  Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad (2024) and
Dalman et al. (2024) give different phylogenetic definitions for this
clade, with the former available online in its version of record
December 22, 2023 compared to the latter being published online January
11, 2024 (and being in an online-only journal).  Of course neither
are registered with the ICPN so neither definition is valid under the
PhyloCode, and due to ICZN Article 36.1 ("A name established for a
taxon at any rank in the family group is deemed to have been
simultaneously established for nominal taxa at all other ranks in the
family group; all these taxa have the same type genus, and their names
are formed from the stem of the name of the type genus [Art. 29.3] with
appropriate change of suffix [Art. 34.1]. The name has the same
authorship and date at every rank") Tyrannosaurini is credited to
Osborn, 1906 anyway so the fact Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad
registered theirs with ZooBank doesn't matter.  That being said,
Dalman et al.'s definition is far more stable regarding taxonomic
content in some recent topologies, as in their topology <span style="font-style: italic;">Bistahieversor</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Lythronax</span>
would be tyrannosaurins under Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad's
definition, and in Warshaw et al.'s 2024 recent paper on anagenetic <span style="font-style: italic;">Daspletosaurus</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">D. horneri</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">D. wilsoni</span> would be tyrannosaurins
under that definition.  Under Dalman et al.'s definition only <span style="font-style: italic;">Zhuchengtyrannus</span>
varies between topologies, and the authorship including several
prominent tyrannosaur workers suggests it is more likely to be followed
and officially implemented in the future.  For now they cover the
same taxa in this page's topology, so Scherer and Voiculescu-Holvad's
definition is given precedence based on publication timing.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Originally referred to cf. <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>

zhuchengensis</i> by Hu et al. (2001) in their <i>Shantungosaurus</i>
monograph. Whether a holotype was specified is uncertain, as the
description has not been translated from Chinese. There is no evidence
the material belongs to one individual or one taxon, and indeed two
teeth are from juveniles unlike the other two and the metatarsal. Hone
et al. (2011) reidentified it as a metatarsal II instead of metatarsal
IV. Hone et al. also state the material is indeterminate, so it cannot
be referred to the sympatric <i>Zhuchengtyrannus</i> and undescribed
tyrannosaurin ZCDM V0030 and V0032, though it may belong to either.
Though Olshevsky (DML, 2002) called it <i>Tarbosaurus zhuchengensis</i>
based on geography, this combination has yet to be published. <br>

holotype PIN 551-2 and paratypes (three more "almost complete skeletons
and many miscellaneous bones") were found in 1948-1949 (Maleev,
1955b).  Maleev (1974) specifies two of the paratype skeletons are
551-4 and 552-1, while the other is probably PIN 551-3, which is
figured as<span style="font-style: italic;"> T. efremovi</span>. 
The types of <span style="font-style: italic;">Gorgosaurus lancinator</span>
(PIN 553-1) and <span style="font-style: italic;">G. novojilovi</span>
(PIN 552-2) were also found in 1948-1949.  Maleev died in 1966
with a large tyrannosaurid monograph in preparation which was published
posthumously with editing by Kurzanov and Rozhdestvensky (Maleev,
1974).  PIN 552-3 is listed by Ford (paleofile.com) as "incomplete
skull and partial skeleton" and is a typo for PIN 552-2 in Currie
(2003), being described as the "holotype of "<span style="font-style: italic;">Maleevosaurus novojilovi</span>,"
after Maleev 1974."  Similarly, PIN 552-4 is listed by Ford as
"partial skeletons" and PIN 555-5 as "partial skeleton", but there is
no evidence in the literature for the existance of these.  Osmólska and
Roniewicz (1970) state that associated with the <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span>
holotype found in 1965, "a nearly complete astragalus of carnosaurian
type, 105 mm long (tr.) was found. This seems too small to be assigned
to this specimen, however, and most probably belongs to a
tarbosaur."  Barsbold (1983) lists "complete skull and well
preserved postcranial skeleton of one specimen (no. 100/59)" and states
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> has a distribution
of Bugin Tsav.  He illustrates the skull and mandible.  Hurum
and Sabath (2003) studied numerous ZPAL specimens discovered between
1964 and 1970, and several IGM specimens discovered from 1964-1986 (see
paper for details).  They note PIN 552-1 had been transferred to
the IGM, and also that "PIN collections also contains several other
skeletons, including fragmentary remains of at least six individuals
from Nemegt, collected during the Soviet expeditions in the years
1946-1949."  Gradzinsky (1970) illustrates ZPAL MgD-I/3 as "Tsagan
Khushu, No. 2" in figure 28, and ZPAL MgD-I/4 as "Nemegt, No. 1" in
figure 29.  This leaves ZPAL MgD-I/29 as probably " Nemegt, No.
2", but which specimen is "Tsagan Khushu, No. 4" is uncertain, though
it is probably one of those listed on the ZPAL website. 
Kielan-Jaworwska and Barsbold (1972) note that in Summer 1970 "two
incomplete skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
sp. and several fragments of the skeletons of the same species" were
found at Nemegt, which are probably ZPAL MgD-I/4 and I/29.  They
also say in August or September of 1970 "an incomplete skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus bataar</span>"
was found at Altan Uul, which is probably ZPAL MgD-I/1-5.  The
large and small specimens found in 1971 in Altan Uul III are probably
among those listed on the ZPAL website.  Gradzinski et al. (1977)
listed <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus bataar</span> as
being known from Bugin Tsav, perhaps based on IGM 100/60-62, found
between 1964 and 1966.  They also listed it as being present in
the White Beds of Khermeen Tsav, perhaps based on IGM 100/69 found in
1973.  Perle et al. (1994) report "in the immediate vicinity of
the holotype skeleton [of <span style="font-style: italic;">Mononykus</span>;
IGM 107/6] the remains of chelonians and the tyrannosaurid <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus bataar</span>
were recovered" at Bugin Tsav, which is probably IGM 107/3. 
Suzuki and Watabe (2000b) state that in August 1998 they "exposed the
large skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
discovered in 1987 by Mongolian expedition party" at Gurilin Tsav.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">New specimens</span>- Watabe and
Suzuki (2000a) reported a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skeleton" found at Bugin Tsav on
September 6 1993.  Another <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
was found there between
September 14-17 1993.  On September 18 1993 a maxilla was
discovered at Tsagan Khushu, then "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skeletal elements" at
Altan Ula-II on September 19.  At Nemegt, they reported a
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> skeleton (badly
weathered)" was found at Central Sayr in
September 24-29, while in the same period a "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> partial
skeleton with hindlimbs - caudals articulated was found at the site
near the Reconnaissance Hill that had been named by the Polish team in
1964."  A "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skull fragment" catalogued as field number
930928 might be part of the latter specimen, as it was from the Western
Sayr so could not belong to the weathered skeleton.  Watabe and
Suzuki (2000b) reported a "complete skeleton of a small individual of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>" (probably field
number 940824 BgT TSGT listed as
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> whole skeleton
without skull"), "other skeletons of large
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurolophus</span> from a single site"
(probably "3 incomplete
skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>"
mentioned later) and "fragments of a skull of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>" found between
August 19-25 1994, "a badly preserved
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> skull" found at
Bugin Tsav II on August 21, and a
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> in northeastern
site" on August 26 (probably field number
940826 BgT OTGN listed as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
lower jaw and
postcranials").  They also reported "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skull fragments"
found on August 28 at Gurilin Tsav.  Tsogtbaatar (2004) listed
940823-BgT-TSOGT as a "Skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
sp.", "incomplete
articulated skeleton of a small tarbosaur" prepared December 1995 to
June 1996 that is probably 940824 BgT TSGT.  Suzuki and Watabe
(2000a) reported the specimens found by <span style="font-style: italic;">Saurolophus</span> in 1994 were
collected on June 16-27 1995, as field numbers 950622 BgT Tarbo. A
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> caudal
vertebrae", 950622-25 BgT Tarbo. PJ1-9 "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
bones", 950624 BgT Tarbo. B "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skull" and 950626 BgT Tarbo. C
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> pelvis." 
They collected the rest of the material on
the way back in August 17 as field numbers 950817 BgT Tarbo. D
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> ribs", 950817BgT
Tarbo. E and 950817 BgT Tarbo. F, both
"<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> gastralia." 
While the 1994 summary states three
individuals were present, the 1995 report states "a skeleton of
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>" was
excavated.  The pubis was prepared in 1998 and
stored at the HMNS (Matsumoto et al., 2000).  Watabe and Suzuki
(2000c) reported "isolated skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>, including at least
two individuals with similar size" were excavated in mid July 1997 from
the Upper White Beds of Kermeen Tsav, corresponding to field number
970716-18 KmT "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
skull, pelvis, femur, humerus others." 
An in situ photo is shown labeled "Skeletons of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> from the
Upper White Bed in Khermeen Tsav.  This is also probably the
complete pes photographed by Matsumoto et al. (2010) labeled 97-21-47
(figure 2a).  More than 2 individuals are buried at the
site."  It shows a maxilla, mid caudals and a chevron. 
Tsogtbaatar (2004) listed the specimen as field number 970718 KmT
Tarbo, including"right and left maxillae, brain case, jugal, lower jaw,
femur."  They also reported "isolated bones of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>" from
Altan Ula-IV and Tsagan Khushu found on July 21-28 and 25-26 1997
respectively.  Isolated bones were also reported from Altan
Ula-III.  Suzuki and Watabe (2000b) reported a "partial skeleton
of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>" found on July
30 1998 at Bugin Tsav, given field number
980803 BgT NAR.  They also reported "an articulated pelvic-caudal
skeleton of small <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>"
found at Gurilin Tsav on August 8 1998,
later cited as a "partial skeleton (caudals, pelvic part, and
hindlimbs) of small-sized <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>." 
This was given field
number 980808 GT ULZ Tarbo and photographed in situ as "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
hind legs and caudal vertebrae at Gurilin Tsav".  Matsumoto et al.
(2000) listed an isolated coracoid from Bugin Tsav as being prepared in
early August 1997 and held at the HMNS.  Watabe et al. (2010)
reported a number of additional specimens found in 2006.  One of
these is field number 060812 BgT TBM (or 060812 BgT-N TBM Tarbo)
discovered at Bugin Tsav in 2006,
photographed by Matsumoto et al. (2010) as 2006-04-001 (figure 2b) and
briefly described by Tsuihiji et al. (2007).  Its skull was later
described in detail by Tsuihiji et al.
(2011) as IGM 107/7.<br>
Currie (2001) figures a <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
snout recovered in 1999, which
matches one of two maxillae illustrated by Currie and Dong (2001) as
"Maxillae of young <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
(GIN 100/177)" and that in Currie (2003)
Figure 3F labeled "Young <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus
bataar</span>, GIN 100/777."  Thus
it is assumed to be 100/777 here while the other more slender maxilla
in Currie and Dong's figure is assigned to 100/177.  Currie (2001)
announced several new specimens collected in September 2000 from the
Nemegt locality (all sent to the IGM)- a frontal, metatarsal IV,
premaxillary tooth, and a juvenile specimen whose pedal phalanges were
collected, but the rest left to be excavated in 2001 (listed as
PJC.2000.9 by Currie, 2002).  This was later catalogued as IGM
107/5, associated with hadrosaurid footprints and figured schematically
by Currie et al. (2003).  may be the specimen listed with field
number PJC 2000.26 by Currie (2003), with listed frontal measurements
slightly larger than IGM 107/7.  Two footprints found at the same
locality (IGM 100F/12 and 100F/14) were also described by Currie et al.
and referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus bataar</span>. 
They can now be confidently
assigned to Tyrannosauridae instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">Deinocheirus</span> because the latter
has blunt pedal unguals, and are probably <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> as even large
<span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus</span> (e.g. <span style="font-style: italic;">Qianzhousaurus</span> type) are smaller
(skull of IGM 100F/12
~1.33 m based on third digit length).  IGM 100F/12 preserves scale
impressions.  Paulina Carabajal (2015) lists three <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus
baatar</span> neurocrania- PJC 2005.07, PJC 2005.17 and PJC 2000.9, all
field
numbers that would eventually be given IGM numbers.  The "frontals
plus occipital condyle" noted as collected in September 2000 by Currie
(2001) from Bugin Tsav are possibly PJC.2000.8 listed by Currie
(2003).  Finally, a tooth was reported by Currie (2001) from Bugin
Tsav.  Currie (2002) reported a cf. <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
glenoid portion of
a scapula found at the Nemegt locality (PJC.2001.14) found in September
2001.  Lee et al. (2008) reported that <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> partial
skeletons were discovered by the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur
Project in 2006 and/or 2007 from one or more of several Nemegt
Formation localities ("Ulan Khushu, Altan Uul, Bugin Tsav, and Guriliin
Tsav") which have previously known specimens.<br>
A furcula is known
(Sabath pers. comm. to Carpenter and Smith, 2001), but the specimen it
belongs to is unreported.  Ford (paleofile.com) lists "Tokyo
Natural Science Museum: Skull and nearly complete skeleton" under
<span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus efremovi</span>, but
further information could not be found.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Skin impressions-</span> Carpenter
(1997) stated "impressions of skin around a badly weathered skull of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> (= <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>) <span style="font-style: italic;">bataar</span>
in Mongolia showed the presence of a wattle or bag of skin under the
jaws (Mikhailov, personal communication)" and later (Carpenter, 1999)
said "<span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
did,
however, apparently have either a pelican-like pouch or dewlap based on
an impression of the skin found below a skull in Mongolia (Mikhailov,
personal communication)."  Mikhailov (pers. comm. 10-8-2019)
states that the specimen was from the Nemegt Formation and found by
Kurzanov but not collected, being on a "large and heavy stone
plate."  He furthermore said the identification as a particular
integumentary structure was Kurzanov's interpretation.  This is
possibly the "frontals plus skin impression" reported from Bugin Tsav
by Currie (2001) who stated it was "from one of the skeletons
apparently destroyed by locals looking for material to sell on the
black market" and that the "specimen [was] known for many years." 
Currie et al. (2003) and Bell et al. (2017) briefly described and
figured this speciemen as IGM 107/6A.  They state the originally
compelete skeleton was poached, leaving only uncollected cranial and
postcranial fragments besides the frontals and two skin patches, which
have an uncertain placement on the body due to the poaching
damage.  Currie et al. (2003) states the frontal interorbital
width is 81 mm, which matches field number PJC 2000.25 as listed by
Currie (2003).<br>
Watabe and Suzuki (2000a) reported that in late September 1993 "it
became clear that in the Western Sayr (named by the Polish expedition
team), the articulated postcranial skeleton of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> with skin
impression that had been discovered and left in field in 1992 had been
destroyed by someone."  While the timeline would work out with
Carpenter's  specimen, it being a posrcranial skeleton would
not. 
Similarly, it being at Nemegt rather than Bugin Tsav shows this was not
what would become IGM 107/6A.<br>
<b>One or more species?</b>- The holotype specimen was first named <i>Tyrannosaurus
bataar</i> by Maleev (1955a), with smaller specimens subsequently named
<i>Tarbosaurus efremovi</i>, <i>Gorgosaurus lancinator</i> and <i>Gorgosaurus
novojilovi</i> (Maleev, 1955b). Maleev (1964) later transferred the
latter two species to <i>Deinodon</i>. Rozhdestvensky (1965)
synonymized all four species into <i>Tarbosaurus bataar</i>, while
Maleev (1974) and Barsbold (1983) used the name<i> Tarbosaurus efremovi</i>
instead. Paul (1988) placed all Nemegt tyrannosaurs into <i>Tyrannosaurus
bataar</i>. These authors all viewed the various sizes and morphologies
as a growth series of one species. Carpenter (1992) separated <i>G.
novojilovi</i> as the new genus <i>Maleevosaurus</i> based on the
laterally obsured promaxillary fenestra; small maxillary fenestra;
large, elongate antorbital fenestra; low and slender maxilla;
moderately developed lacrimal horn lacking rugosity; slender jugal;
non-rugose postorbital; slender dentary; tall cervical neural spines;
reduced acromion on scapula; pronounced spur-like obturator process;
downcurved ischium; and metatarsals III and IV don't overlap the
metatarsals medial to them much. Carr (1998; 1999; 2005) has shown the
cranial characters are due to ontogeny, while the only ontogenetic
studies of tyrannosaur postcrania that have been published have dealt
with proportions. Nor has individual variation in postcrania been
studied much, though <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> does vary in obturator
process size and ischial curvature. Thus the postcranial characters are
here seen as ontogenetic or individual variation, perhaps even
involving preservational effects. Even Olshevsky currently believes <i>Maleevosaurus</i>
to be a juvenile tarbosaur. Olshevsky (1995) separated <i>Tyrannosaurus
bataar</i> from <i>Tarbosaurus efremovi</i>, placing the former
species in the new genus <i>Jenghizkhan</i> because he did not believe
it to be closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> than to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>.
He diagnosed this taxon using a number of seemingly ontogenetic
characters- large size; massive and rugose preorbital and postorbital
bars; lacrimal-postorbital contact; well developed anterior dorsal
parapophyses; as well as a couple postcranial characters of uncertain
significance- tall anterior dorsal neural arches; well developed
anterior dorsal neural arch laminae. Olshevsky claimed since the <i>Gorgosaurus
lancinator</i> holotype (PIN 553-1) is a smaller specimen than the <i>Tarbosaurus
efremovi</i> holotype (PIN 551-2), yet shows the cranial characters of
PIN 551-1, it is a juvenile <i>Jenghizkhan</i> and the characters are
not ontogenetic. Rugosity can be individually variable as well as
ontogenetically variable. In <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, FMNH PR2081 has
more young features than its size suggests it should (Carr, 2005), and
this may be true for the holotype of <i>Tarbosaurus efremovi</i> as
well. Vertebral characters have not been examined for taxonomic,
ontogenetic or individual variation in any tyrannosaurids, so their
significance in diagnosing <i>Jenghizkhan</i> is unclear. Although
variation in Nemegt tyrannosaurines hasn't been studied in depth,
basically all researchers find no justification for recognizing more
than one species - <i>Tarbosaurus bataar</i> (Currie, 2003; Hurum and
Sabath, 2003; Holtz, 2004; Carr, 2005).<br>
<b><i>Shanshanosaurus</i></b>- Discovered in 1964-1966, <i>Shanshanosaurus</i>
was described from the Subashi Formation of Xinjiang, China (Dong,
1977). Dong placed it its own family, Shanshanosauridae, close to the
Tyrannosauridae within Carnosauria. He posed but dismissed the
possibility it was a juvenile tyrannosaurid based on his incorrect
interpretation of the odontoid process being fused to the axis and
vague cranial and mandibular characters. Paul (1988) thought <i>Shanshanosaurus</i>
was related to <i>Aublysodon mirandus</i> and LACM 28471 (a specimen
he named <i>Aublysodon molnaris</i>, but which is now recognized as a
juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>), calling it <i>Aublysodon
huoyanshanensis</i> and placing it Aublysodontinae within the
Tyrannosauridae. Though Paul's generic synonymy was not often followed,
his placement of <i>Shanshanosaurus</i> in an Aublysodontidae/inae was
standard through the 1990's, sometimes renamed Shanshanosaurinae
(Olshevsky, 1995) due to <i>Aublysodon</i>'s indeterminate nature.
Holtz (2001) was the first to include <i>Shanshanosaurus</i> in a
cladistic analysis, where it emerged as a basal tyrannosaurine due to
its low tooth count. However, Dong's tooth counts are incomplete
(Currie and Dong, 2001). Currie and Dong (2001) restudied and
redescribed the material, resulting in some corrections. The supposed
postorbital identified by Dong was a proximal rib, while the cervical
vertebrae are amphicoelous, not procoelous (contra Molnar et al.,
1990). Indeed, nothing prevents the specimen from being a juvenile
tyrannosaurid, though Currie and Dong were reluctant to assign it to
any particular genus. They did note it was more similar to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
than <i>Alioramus</i> in the arrangement of its maxillary nutrient
foramina, but Currie (2003) later indicated this was not diagnostic of <i>Alioramus</i>.
Carr (2005) found <i>Shanshanosaurus</i> emerged as the sister taxon
to <i>Tarbosaurus</i> + <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> before ontogenetically
influenced characters were taken into account. Furthermore, he
identified a synapomorphy present in <i>Shanshanosaurus</i> and some <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
individuals- a subcutaneous flange extending dorsally off the
horizontal maxillary ramus. Interestingly, some <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
specimens lack it (GIN coll., PIN 551-1, 553-1) and it's not
ontogenetic. Perhaps sexual or individual variation? <br>
<b>Non-Nemegt <i>Tarbosaurus</i>?</b>- Although often touted as
ranging widely over Asia, diagnostic <i>Tarbosaurus</i> remains have
only been verified from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia and (thanks to
<i>Shanshanosaurus</i>) the Subashi Formation of China. In addition to <i>Shanshanosaurus</i>,
Dong (1977) described some fragments from the latter locality found in
1964-1966 as <i>Tarbosaurus sp.</i>. Zhai et al. (1978) later listed
the nomen nudum <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> "turpanensis", which judging by
the horizon, locality and known elements, is based on Dong's material.
These are provisionally referred to <i>T. bataar</i> here given its
presence in the formation and seeming absence of other tyrannosaurids
in the Nemegt (assuming the faunas are similar).<br>
Fragmentary remains from the Quipa Formation of China were named <i>Tyrannosaurus
luanchuanensis</i> (Dong, 1979), later referred to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
(Olshevsky, 1991) and <i>Jenghizkhan</i> (Olshevsky, 1995). Carr and
Williamson (2000) noted its teeth have a denticle density like that of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
(6-11 per 5 mm mesial, 5.5-10 distal), different from <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
and albertosaurines. Since <i>Tarbosaurus</i> has the same density as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
(Hurum and Sabath, 2003), and the Quipa Formation is Maastrichtian like
the Nemegt Formation, it is provisionally considered a junior synonym
of <i>T. bataar</i> although its seemingly later age may indicate a
distinct species. <br>
Jerzykiewicz et al. (1993) referred premaxillary and maxillary teeth
from the Late Campanian Djadochta Formation of Mongolia to <i>Tarbosaurus
sp.</i>. This is slightly earlier than the Nemegt Formation, suggesting
they are not from <i>T. bataar</i> at least. <br>
Dong (1979) referred fragmentary IVPP remains from the Nanxiong Group
of Guangdong to <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
sp., noting (translated) "Specimens were not collected from the same
locality but they are provisionally assigned the same genus based upon
morphology."  The lateral tooth is said to have 7-8 serrations per
5 mm
mesially and 11 per 5 mm distally.  When Russell et al. (1993)
stated
"Rare skeletal remains in the
Pingling Formation indicate the presence of ... tyrannosaurids" they
cite Dong, 1979 and mean these specimens, as they were using Zhao et
al's 1991 stratigraphy where the Pingling Formation is used for the
highest section of the Nanxiong Formation (equivalent to the Zhenshui
Formation in Li et al.'s 2007 stratigraphy).  Their stratigraphic
level
(as <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
sp.) is shown in Figure 2 section 10 number 12 of
Mateer and Chen (1992).  Note Le Loeuff (2012) places these
remains in the Yuanpu Formation (below the Pingling Formation in Zhao
et al.'s stratigraphy) and mistakes Russell et al.'s Pingling reference
as different tyrannosaurid material.  Mo and Xu (2015) described a
tooth from the Nanxiong Group of Jiangxi which they referred to
Tyrannosauridae indet., noting it was comparable in size to <i>Zhuchengtyrannus</i>
but more recurved.  It has 7.5-10 serrations per 5 mm
distally.  Lü et al. (2009) described a tyrannosaurid tooth from
the Dongyuan Formation of Guangdong (HYMV-7), where (translated) most
of the serrations are missing." All examples are much larger than the
contemporaneous <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Qianzhousaurus</span> holotype) or <span style="font-style: italic;">Asiatyrannus</span>, with NHMG 8501 and
HYM-7 at least having a Crown Basal Ratio in the range of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> and much higher than <span style="font-style: italic;">Alioramus</span> (unreported for <span style="font-style: italic;">Asiatyrannus</span>). 
Given this and the age of Dong's specimens at least (Early
Maastrichtian according to Xi et al. 2021, with the others potentially
being that age), they are provisionally retained in <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span>
here.<br>
Nessov (1995) referred a femur (N 601/12457) from the Bostobe Formation
of Kazakhstan to <i>Tarbosaurus sp.</i> (incorrectly translated by
Olshevsky, DML 1996 as an ilium), but Carr (2005) determined it lacks
the synapomorphies of <i>Tarbosaurus</i> + <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> and
of <i>Alectrosaurus</i>. It seems to be a <i>Beipiaosaurus</i>-grade
therizinosaur. Bazhanov and Kostenko (1958) referred a dentary (IZK
33/MP-61) from Kara-Cheku in Kazakhstan to <i>Tyrannosaurus aff. bataar</i>,
but Averianov et al. (2012) redescribed it as indeterminate within the <i>Tarbosaurus</i>-<i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
clade. Finally, Nessov noted tyrannosaurid remains in Bolotsky and
Moisyeyenko (1988) from the Udurchukan Formation of the Tsagayan Group
of Russia, which he stated were probably <i>Tarbosaurus sp.</i>.
Bolotsky (2013) has referred the larger teeth and metacarpal I from
this formation to Tyrannosaurinae, but characters of <i>Tarbosaurus</i>
itself have yet to be identified.<br>
Another specimen often referred to <i>T. bataar</i> (e.g. Molnar et
al., 1990) is <i>Albertosaurus? periculosus</i> from the Yuliangze
Formation of China (equivalent to the Udurchukan Formation). Bolotsky's
thesis argued this and similar specimens from the Udurchukan Formation
were more likely albertosaurines based on their abundance compared to
larger specimens, but it remains possible these are juvenile
tyrannosaurines. <br>
<i>Chingkankousaurus fragilis</i> is also sometimes listed as a junior
synonym of <i>Tarbosaurus bataar</i>, but is based on an indeterminate
partial scapula equally similar to other derived tyrannosauroids
(Brusatte et al., 2013).  It is from the Wangshi Series of China,
along with <i>Tarbosaurus? zhuchengensis</i>, originally <i>Tyrannosaurus
zhuchengensis</i> (Hu et al., 2001). Based on a metatarsal and some
referred teeth, the Chinese description has yet to be translated,
though the earlier age suggests it is not <i>T. bataar</i>.<br>
Finally, <i>Alioramus remotus</i> from the Beds of Nogoon Tsav in
Mongolia may be a juvenile <i>T. bataar</i>, though this is is

on the AMNH website. They are more likely to be the contemporaneous <i>Zhuchengtyrannus</i>.<br>

<b>Comments</b>- Discovered in 2001, this specimen was originally
identified as a young <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> and nicknamed Sir
William (Anonymous, 2004). It is listed as an individual of this
species in Erickson et al. (2004) and on the AMNH online catalogue.
However, it later became clear it was preserved in the Upper Judith
River Formation, not the Hell Creek Formation (Stein and Triebold,
2005). The latter authors believe this specimen represents a new taxon,
close to the ancestry of <i>T. rex</i>. The AMNH 30564 portion
apparently consists of a gastralium fragment, while the RMDRC reported
the main specimen was being prepared in their lab through March 2010
(Maltese, 2010 online).<br>
Kemmick (2004) reported fifty <i>Nanotyrannus</i> teeth associated
with this specimen. Maltese (pers. comm., 2008) found these teeth were
similar to albertosaurines and <i>Daspletosaurus</i> in morphology.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Comments</span>- Discovered in April
1983, this specimen was originally published by Lozinsky et al. (1984),
who referenced "an incomplete jaw of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span>"
and further stated "This very significant specimen is in the
collections of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and has been
made available to us through the courtesy of David Gillette, who first
recognized its significance. A detailed description of this specimen
will be undertaken by the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and the
New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources in a separate
paper."  Gillette et al. (1986) described it as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus rex</span> specimen,
although not based on explicit character evidence- "Comparison with the
lower jaw of the type specimen of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus
rex</span> (American Museum of Natural History) shows the NMMNH
P-1013-1 to be referable to <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span>.
This assignment includes the dentary, prearticular, and probably the
chevron, which was closely associated with the other elements and
closely resembles the anterior chevron of <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span> described by Osborn (1912:
pl. 27)." While Lehman and Carpenter (1990) wrote "Other fragmentary
specimens, referred to <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>,
from elsewhere in New Mexico (Gillette et al., 1986) and Texas (Lawson,
1976) may belong to a new genus (Carpenter, in press b)", the resulting
Carpenter 1990 publication only mentioned the Texas specimen TMM
41436-1.  Dalman et al. (2024) published a redescription based in
part on newly found material (maxillary fragments, postorbital,
squamosal, splenial, angular, articular, two additional teeth,
additional chevrons), reidentifying the original supposed incomplete
articular as a palatine.  Note early versions of the pdf
incorrectly give the article number as "(2023) 13:22124" despite saying
it was published online January 11, 2024.  Future versions
corrected this to "(2024) 14:22124".  Dalman et al. incorrectly
state the palatine is from the left side in their materials list,
contra the supplementary info and figure S5.  While "associated
chevrons" are listed in the holotype material, they are not commented
on further so it is uncertain how many more were found than the one
described by Gillette et al..  <br>
Dalman et al. used Loewen's tyrannosauroid analysis to recover <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus mcraeensis</span> sister to <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span>, while it was in a
trichotomy with <span style="font-style: italic;">T. rex</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Tarbosaurus</span> in Carr's analysis as
they had not added characters specific to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> mcraeensis</span> + <span style="font-style: italic;">rex</span> clade to that one.<br>

<b>Diagnosis</b>- (after Carr, 2005) lacrimal horn absent; anterior

<b>Comments-</b> Although often said to be known from few specimens in
popular works, a large number of fairly complete specimens are known,
with more being discovered each year and most remaining undescribed.
This is no doubt due to the extensive fieldwork done in the Hell Creek
and Lance Formations, the distinctive nature and size of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
remains, and the popularity of the animal. In general, specimens
discovered since 1990 have not been described in the technical
literature. Because of its fame, many specimens get nicknames and are
reported to the popular press prior to mention in the technical
literature, so that original references are more difficult to track
down. Thus the references given in the materials list below may not be
the first published. Osborn (1916) questionably referred AMNH 5050 to <i>Ornithomimus
velox</i>, but it is a tyrannosaurid dentary, probably <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
itself based on provenance.<br>
<b>Lance <i>Aublysodon</i> species</b>- Marsh (1892) described two new
species of <i>Aublysodon</i> (<i>A. amplus</i> and <i>A. cristatus</i>)
based on unserrated premaxillary teeth from the Lance Formation of
Wyoming. These are juvenile tyrannosaurines, based on the lack of
serrations (Currie, 2003), and are thus probably <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>,
based on provenance. They are indistinguishable from Judith River
tyrannosaurine (<i>Daspletosaurus</i>?) juvenile premaxillary teeth, so
are technically nomina dubia. Hence neither species name can be a
senior synonym of <i>rex</i>.<br>
<i><b>Manospondylus gigas</b></i>- In 1892, Cope described <i>Manospondylus</i>
as a ceratopsid from the Lance Formation of South Dakota. Hatcher et
al. (1907) later referred it to the Theropoda, and Osborn (1916) noted
its close resemblence to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. While near certainly
synonymous with <i>T. rex</i>, as no other large theropods are known
from Late Maastrichtian US deposits, the holotype two cervicodorsal
centra do not possess <i>T. rex</i> apomorphies other than their size.
Consequently, <i>M. gigas</i> has been viewed as invalid for a century
and is technically a nomen oblitum, so cannot have taxonomic priority
over <i>T. rex</i> despite its historical priority. New remains
supposedly from the <i>Manospondylus</i> holotype were discovered in
2000, as discussed below.<br>
<b>Armored <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>?</b>- In 1900, the holotype of <i>Dynamosaurus
imperiosus</i> (then AMNH 5866) was discovered with 77 osteoderms (now
NHMUK R8001), thought by Osborn (1905, 1906, 1916) to belong to the
theropod. Carpenter (2004) confirmed these belong to <i>Ankylosaurus</i>,
with the supposed differences noted by Brown (1908) and Osborn being
due to comparisons with AMNH <i>Euoplocephalus</i> (or <i>Anoplosaurus</i>?)
material.<br>
<b>The <i>Nanotyrannus</i> problem</b>- Discovered in 1942 in the Hell
Creek Formation of Montana, CMN 7541 was described as <i>Gorgosaurus
lancensis</i> (Gilmore, 1946). It was generally assigned to this genus
or its subjective synonym, <i>Albertosaurus</i> (Russell, 1970; Paul,
1988), though Paul did place it in a separate subgenus. In 1988, Bakker
et al. redescribed the specimen as a new genus, <i>Nanotyrannus</i>,
and placed it as the most basal tyrannosauroid. A bibliographic listing
of the paper (in Currie, 1987) prior to its publication used the name
"Clevelanotyrannus", which was perhaps an early suggested name for the
taxon, though Currie (pers. comm. to Ford on www.paleofile.com) claims
he has never heard of it. Additionally, a New Scientist article
(Anonymous, 1988) from right before the publication of Bakker et al.'s
paper called it "Nanotyrannes". Rozhdestvensky (1965) was the first to
suggest CMN 7541 was a juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, which was also
considered a possibility by Carpenter (1992), though Carr (1999) was
the first to officially propose it. Since then it has been clear that
CMN 7541 is juvenile (due to striated cortical bone and numerous
characters seen in other juvenile tyrannosaurids), but it is disputed
whether it is a juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i> (Holtz, 2001; Carr
and Williamson, 2004; Carr, 2005; Henderson, 2005), or the juvenile of
a sister species to <i>T. rex</i> (Currie, 2003; Currie et al., 2003;
Witmer and Ridgely, 2010; Larson, 2013). In 2001, an additional
juvenile specimen (BMRP 2002.4.1 or "Jane") conspecific with CMN 7541
was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. It was discussed
extensively at 2005 conferences, and is being monographed by Carr et
al.. Evidence for CMN 7541 and BMRP 2002.4.1 being distinct from <i>T.
rex</i>
include a higher tooth count, subnarial foramen enclosed by maxilla,
dorsally opening jugal foramen, notches in the dorsal quadratojugal,
lateral pneumatic foramen on the quadratojugal, low cultriform process,
small subsellar recess, laterally positioned vagus foramen, two pairs
of foramina in the basisphenoid sinus, extensive medial subcondylar
recess, adjacent medial and lateral foramina in the subcondylar recess,
strong condylotuberal crest, laterally oriented scapular glenoid, fused
scapulocoracoid and pevic sutures, and posteriorly hooked preacetabular
process. However, no Hell Creek tyrannosaurine adults with these
characters are known, nor are any juveniles lacking them. Woodward et
al. (2020) performed a histological analysis and determined BMRP
2002.4.1's age to be at least thirteen years old.  Schmerge and
Rothschild (2016) present a highly flawed paper proposing the lateral
dentary groove of Jane is an albertosaurine character, but don't even
reference juvenile <i>Tarbosaurus</i> IGM 107/7 which has the groove
despite at least several adults lacking it, and only code <i>Nanotyrannus</i>
for a minority of known characters in their reanalysis of the Brusatte
et al. tyrannosauroid matrix. I provisionally accept <i>Nanotyrannus</i>
as a juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, though the publication of BMRP
2002.4.1's description may change this.<br>
Additional specimens referred to <i>Nanotyrannus</i> consist mostly of
teeth, and have not been described in detail. Langston (1955 field
notes) apparently noted a skull and skeleton (presumably referred to <i>Gorgosaurus
lancensis</i> at the time) from the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, though
these have not been discussed in the literature since. Three teeth
(DMNH coll.) from the Lance Formation of South Dakota were referred by
Bakker et al. (1988). Derstler (1995) reported teeth from the Lance
Formation of Wyoming. Another three teeth and a jugal (BHI coll.) from
the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota associated with FMNH PR2081
were originally identified a s a juvenile <i>T. rex</i> (Erickson,
1999), but have been referred to <i>Nanotyrannus</i> as well (Larson
pers. comm., 1997 to Ford and Chure, 2001). A lacrimal (BHI 6235?) may
also belong to this specimen (Larson, 2013). It was reported that <i>Nanotyrannus</i>
teeth (as identified by Bakker) were associated with the subadult <i>T.
rex</i> nicknamed Tinker from the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota
(Blasing, DML 2006), though its teeth are similar to those of adult
tyrannosaurids. Spencer et al. (2001) referred teeth from the Lance
Formation of Wyoming to <i>Nanotyrannus sp.</i>. Kemmick (2004)
reported fifty <i>Nanotyrannus</i> teeth associated with what was then
thought to be a <i>T. rex</i> skeleton in Montana. This turned out to
be the skeleton of a different species from the earlier Judith River
Formation however, and these teeth are more likely from another
juvenile tyrannosaurid. Maltese (pers. comm., 2008) found these teeth
were similar to albertosaurines and <i>Daspletosaurus</i> in
morphology. It should be noted that <i>Nanotyrannus</i> teeth only
differ from <i>T. rex</i>
in ontogenetic characters, so isolated teeth cannot be referred to
either taxon. A phalanx was reported by Stenerson and O'Conner (1994)
from the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota, but this is obviously
based on size alone. Larson et al. (2003) note that in their collection
of ninety-one tyrannosaurid teeth from the Lower Hell Creek Formation
of South Dakota, some are more laterally compressed than others, and
that this includes large teeth, while small teeth can be robust as
well. They suggested the possibility of two tyrannosaurid taxa. A
specimen slightly larger than BMRP 2002.4.1 nicknamed Petey (BMRP
2006.4.4) was estimated at over fifteen years old by Woodward et al.
(2020).  Burnham et al. (2018) report a juvenile <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>
from Garfield County, Montana with juvenile bone surface texture that
is "nearly the same size as ... BMRP 2002.4.1."  Interestingly,
"the maxilla ... only contains 12 alveoli" and  "the first
maxillary tooth of KUVP 156375 is morphologically distinct from that of
BMRP 2002.4.1", suggesting this specimen reached skeletal maturity in
these features more quickly than the three other known '<span style="font-style: italic;">Nanotyrannus</span>' specimens with
maxillae or supporting the latter being taxonomically distinct from
KUVP 156375 and other <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span>. 
A largely complete specimen from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana
associated with a <i>Triceratops</i> (the so-called Dueling Dinosaurs)
has been referred to <i>Nanotyrannus</i> as well, but is in a private
collection and remains undescribed. It shares the high tooth count,
enclosed subnarial foramen, jugal foramen orientation, and hooked
preacetabular process with other specimens, and additionally differs
from adult<i> T. rex</i> in having a phalanx on manual digit III.<br>
<b>Huxley rex</b>- First observed in 1946, RTMP 81.12.1 (nicknamed
Huxley rex) is known from a badly eroded skeleton in the Scollard
Formation of Alberta. Only a pedal phalanx had been collected as of
1970 (Langston, 1965; Russell, 1970), though more was collected by
Currie in 1981.<br>
<i><b>Dinotyrannus megagracilis</b></i>- In 1967 a partial skeleton
(LACM 23845) was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana and
initially thought to be an immature <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. It was
described by Molnar (1980) as an individual of <i>Albertosaurus
lancensis</i>, now agreed to be a juvenile <i>T. rex</i> or the
juvenile of a sister species to <i>T. rex</i>. LACM 23845 was later
(Paul, 1988) made the holotype of a new species- <i>Albertosaurus</i>
"megagracilis". Olshevsky (1995) placed the species in a new genus, <i>Dinotyrannus</i>,
which he believed was a derived tyrannosaurine closely related to <i>Nanotyrannus</i>
and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. Later, Rauhut (2000) noted <i>Albertosaurus</i>
"megagracilis" is a nomen nudum, as Paul did not illustrate it, cites
the wrong reference and gives no formal diagnosis. This makes Olshevsky
the official author of the taxon. Carr and Williamson (2000)
provisionally considered <i>Dinotyrannus</i> a subadult <i>T. rex</i>,
which confirmed in the detailed redescription and analysis by Carr and
Williamson (2004). The latter authors also corrected some
misidentifications by Molnar, such as the apparently downbent nasals
being damaged, the supposedly absent olecranon process of the ulna
being missing, and the supposed manual ungual being pedal ungual I.
Carr and Williamson's identification is universally accepted today. <br>
<b>The largest skull</b>- Though discovered in 1967 and described in
the technical literature (Molnar, 1991), MOR 008 was not well known to
the public until 2006, when the incomplete skull was assembled and
discovered to be larger than that of FMNH PR2801. This makes the
specimen, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, the largest fairly
complete <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> skull known.<br>
<b>Texas maxilla</b>- In 1970, a maxilla was discovered in the Tornillo
Formation of Texas, described in Lawson's (1972) unpublished thesis as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
"vannus" (while names occuring only in theses are generally excluded
from this website, it was mentioned in the literature by Naish, 2009).
It was later described by Lawson (1976) as merely a subadult <i>Tyrannosaurus
rex</i>. Carpenter (1990) questioned this on the basis of the shorter
anterior body, deeper posteroventral process and slightly larger
maxillary fenestra. However, Carr and Williamson (2000) noted it shares
numerous <i>T. rex</i> apomorphies and that short anterior bodies are
present in some other <i>T. rex</i> specimens (e.g. BHI 3033). The
proportional differences can thus be explained by individual variation.
Molnar (1991) and Brochu (2003) also accept this specimen as <i>T. rex</i>
or a sister species.<br>
<b>The largest maxilla</b>- Collected in 1977, UCMP 118742 is a very
large maxilla (810 mm long) from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana.
It is famous due to Paul's (1988) estimate of a body length of 13.6
meters, which would make it one of the longest <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>'
known. In 1996 however, Paul (DML) had stated his prior mass estimate
(12 tons) was too high. His new mass estimate (7-8.5 tons) is still 15%
larger than his estimate for FMNH PR2801, so UCMP 118742 may still be
5% longer than FMNH PR2801 in his view, at ~13.4 meters. Thus it seems
Paul was revising his mass estimates of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, not his
length estimate of UCMP 118742.<br>
<b>The Jordan theropod or <i>Stygovenator molnari</i></b>- Molnar
(1978) described a partial theropod snout (LACM 28471) discovered in
1966, from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. He did not name it
(calling it the Jordan theropod) and identified the specimen as a
dromaeosaurid. Currie (1987) suggested it may be referrable to <i>Aublysodon</i>,
and Paul (1988) later named it <i>Aublysodon molnaris</i> (later
emmended to <i>molnari</i> by Paul in 1990, to match the gender of <i>Aublysodon</i>).
Molnar and Carpenter (1989) redescribed the specimen as <i>Aublysodon
cf. mirandus</i>, due to the lack of difference between it and the
holotype tooth of that species. Olshevsky (1995) separated LACM from <i>Aublysodon</i>
as <i>Stygivenator molnari</i>, based on the supposedly smaller and
mesiodistally narrower premaxillary tooth than that of <i>A. mirandus</i>.
Carr and Williamson (2000) noted the supposedly diagnostic characters
were typical of juvenile tyrannosaurids and considered it the juvenile
of an indeterminate tyrannosaurid, pending restudy. Holtz (2001)
included it in a cladistic analysis, where it emerged as a basal
tyrannosauroid along with a chimaera of <i>Alectrosaurus</i> + GI
100/50 + 100/51 and OMNH 10131 (a juvenile <i>Bistahieversor</i>) in
an "aublysodontine" clade. Currie (2003) considered LACM 28471 to be a
juvenile <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>, which was confirmed in a detailed
redescription and analysis by Carr and Williamson (2004). The latter
authors also corrected some misidentifications by Molnar, Molnar and
Carpenter, and Olshevsky, such as the presence of interdental plates
and the identification of the supposed premaxillary tooth as a first
maxillary tooth. Most authors agree with the synonymy with <i>T. rex</i>
(including Holtz, 2004), with Olshevsky being an exception. If <i>Nanotyrannus
lancensis</i> turns out to be distinct from <i>T. rex</i>, it is
unclear which taxon the younger LACM 28471 belongs to. <br>
<b>Black Beauty and Stan</b>- Discovered in 1980, RTMP 81.6.1
(nicknamed Black Beauty) was discovered in the Willow Creek Formation
of Alberta.<br>
BHI 3033 (nicknamed Stan) was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of
South Dakota in 1987 and excavated in 1992. It is exceptionally
complete, especially the skull (missing only one coronoid and
articular) and vertebral column (missing only less than fifteen
caudals), though suffering numerous pathologies. The specimen has been
fully prepared but only the skull has been described (Larson, 2008). A
portion of the BHI's website is devoted to the specimen- <a href="http://www.bhigr.com/pages/info/info_stan.htm">http://www.bhigr.com/pages/info/info_stan.htm</a>.
As detailed by Greshko (2022), the BHI sold Stan on October 5, 2020 to
the Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi, slated to open in 2025.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Wankel Rex or <span style="font-style: italic;">T. regina</span></span>-
Discovered in 1988, Wankel Rex was found in the Hell Creek Formation of
Montana.  Originally catalogued as MOR 555, it was the subject of
Horner and Lessem's (1993) book "The Complete <i>T. rex</i>", and
has since been loaned to the USNM in June 2013 for 50 years (Freedom du
Lac, 2013) and is now known as USNM 555000.  Paul et al. (2021)
have used this as the holotype of their proposed gracile <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> species, <span style="font-style: italic;">T. regina</span>. 
Their species diagnosis is- "Generally gracile with an adult
femur-length/circumference ratio over 2.4, usually one slender anterior
incisiform dentary tooth."<br>
<b>Sue or <i>T.</i> "stanwinstonorum"</b> or <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">T. imperator</span>-
Perhaps the most famous <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> specimen, FMNH PR2081
(nicknamed Sue) was discovered in 1990 in the Hell Creek Formation of
South Dakota. FMNH PR2081 is significant for both its size (~12.8 m)
and completeness. After a legal battle over who owned the specimen, it
was sold to the FMNH for $8.4 million. This is the most complete
specimen to be well described in the literature, with an extensive
osteology published (Brochu, 2003). A possible proatlas arch is
preserved, the first identified in a theropod. The furcula identified
by Brochu and mounted on the skeleton is a pathological gastralium
(Larson and Rigby, 2005). However, the latter authors identified the
supposed thirteenth dorsal rib described by Brochu as the true furcula.
The supposed huge olfactory bulbs are actually olfactory chambers,
containing nasal turbinates (Witmer and Ridgely, 2005). Also notable is
that the remains of three other younger <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> were
found with the specimen (Larson, 1995), perhaps indicating social
behavior. These have not been described, however. Harlan (1990) used
the name <i>Tyrannosaurus gigantus</i> in the title of a Newsweek
article about Sue, but did not intend this as an actual species.
Pickering (1995) made BHI 2033 (which FMNH PR2081 was catalogued as
until 2000) the holotype of a new species, <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
"stanwinstonorum". This was published in a private newsletter however,
so is a nomen nudum. It was also based on characters which are probably
individual variation (larger body size than <i>T. rex</i>; reduced
nasal rugosities), incorrect (palatine recess absent; rugosity absent
on ventral pterygoid wing of palatine; supradentary absent), or
ambiguous (reduced postorbital-orbital joint). There is therefore no
evidence <i>T.</i> "stanwinstonorum" is valid. Paul et al. (2021) have
since used this as a holotype of their proposed early and robust <span style="font-style: italic;">Tyrannosaurus</span> species <span style="font-style: italic;">T. imperator</span>,
with the diagnosis of- "Generally robust with an adult
femur-length/circumference ratio of 2.4 or less; usually two slender
anterior incisiform dentary teeth."  FMNH PR2081 has a website
devoted to it- <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/sue-t-rex">https://www.fieldmuseum.org/blog/sue-t-rex</a>.
<br>
<b>Early 90's specimens</b>- Discovered in 1991, SMNH P2523.8
(nicknamed Scotty) is represented by an incomplete skull and skeleton
from the Frenchman Formation of Saskatchewan (Tokaryk and Bryant,
2004). The skeleton's size and arrangement, and the composition of the
surrounding matrix, have delayed preparation and description, but the
skull is being described by Tokaryk. <br>
A specimen nicknamed Samson was excavated in 1992 in the Hell Creek
Formation of South Dakota. It originally went by the nicknames Z-rex
and Mr. Zed while it was for sale in Kansas. The CMN acquired it and
begain preparation of the exceptionally well preserved skull in 2004
and completed it in 2006. It was sold to a private collection in
2009.  Glut (2002) reported the femur is 1.36 meters long, but
Larson (2008b) has it as 1.295 meters.<br>
A specimen nicknamed Bowman was discovered in 1992 in the Hell Creek
Formation of North Dakota, briefly mentioned by Oakland and Pearson
(1995). It is still encased in plaster jackets and may not be prepared
due to the hard concretion surrounding the bones.<br>
Discovered in 1993 is BHI 4100 (nicknamed Duffy), from the Hell Creek
Formation of South Dakota (Browne, 1993). <br>
Discovered in 1994, BHI 4182 (nicknamed Fox or County rex) is based on
a fragmentary skull and skeleton from the Hell Creek Formation of South
Dakota. Its dentary is 90% as long as FMNH PR2081.<br>
A specimen nicknamed Barnum was collected from the Hell Creek Formation
of South Dakota in 1995. Although it was popularized as being the rest
of the <i>Dynamosaurus</i> type specimen, both specimens preserve
dentaries and a left femur, so this cannot be the case (Ford, vrtpaleo;
Carpenter, DML 2004). Unfortunately, it was sold to a private bidder in
an auction in 2004.<br>
Discovered in 1995, LDP 977-2 (nicknamed Pete) was found in the Lance
Formation of Wyoming. Derstler and Myers (2008) wrote a preliminary
report on it.<br>
<b>Rigby rex or Peck's rex</b>- MOR 980 (nicknamed the Rigby rex then
Peck's rex) was collected and first reported in 1997 from the Hell
Creek Formation of Montana. It was originally said to be the largest <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
known, with a pubis reportedly 8% longer than in FMNH PR2081. It was
also said to have larger, more robust forelimbs than <i>T. rex</i> and
different caudal structure. The pubis seemed too large for the cranial
material, intitially suggesting different proportions than other <i>T.
rex</i> specimens. These differences caused Melbourne (1998) to suggest
some were calling the specimen <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> “imperator”,
though this is a nomen nudum and none of the differences have been
substantiated after further preparation. Later, Rigby claimed at least
one other individual was represented (as shown by the supposed presence
of four pubes in the collection), which was supposedly average sized.
Another more fragmentary specimen was also said to be possibly present.
However, further preparation has confirmed the presence of only one
specimen in the quarry (Morrow pers. comm., 2006; Derstler and Myers,
2008). At ~12.8 meters, it is indeed one of the largest <i>T. rex</i>
specimens and also one of the most complete (80%+). MOR 980 is also
notable for preserving a furcula (Larson and Rigby, 2005) and the first
reported <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> metacarpal III. A website was devoted to
the specimen from 2004-2006- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060808040539/http://www.pecksrex.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20060808040539/http://www.pecksrex.com/</a>.<br>
<b>Bucky</b>- CMI 2001.90.1 (nicknamed Bucky) was discovered in 1998 in
the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota. It is a subadult specimen
notable for its furcula (Larson and Rigby, 2005), the first correctly
identified <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> furcula to be described. The rest of
the specimen remains undescribed, but is featured on the BHI website
(BHI 2007 online).<br>
<b>Alaskan <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>?</b>- Gangloff (1998) listed <i>Tyrannosaurus
sp.</i>(?) in the faunal list for Alaskan dinosaurs, and only the
Prince Creek Formation is young enough to contain the genus. However,
in a later work detailing the theropod teeth from the Prince Creek
Formation (Fiorillo and Gangloff, 2000), the nine tyrannosaurid teeth
were not identified to genus level. It is assumed Gangloff reconsidered
his tentative identification and there remains no <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
known from Alaska. <br>
<b>Tinker the subadult</b>- In 1998, a subadult <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of South Dakota and
nicknamed Tinker. Although touted as a juvenile in the press releases,
Tinker is much larger than the '<i>Nanotyrannus</i>' specimens CMNH
7541 and BMRP 2002.4.1, almost the size of the <i>Dinotyrannus</i>
holotype. It is therefore unsurprising it possesses a low number of
mediolaterally thick teeth characteristic of older tyrannosaurids,
instead of the narrower more numerous teeth of '<i>Nanotyrannus</i>'
specimens. Interestingly, the latter type of tooth was found associated
with Tinker, perhaps suggesting scavenging by younger <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
individuals or social behavior. Blasing (DML 2006) stated that another
young <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> (nicknamed Belle) and remains of an adult
(nicknamed Regina) were present in the jackets with Tinker.
Unfortunately, Tinker was not deposited in a museum and was bought by a
private individual who currently has it and Regina on display and for
sale at the Etihad Modern Art Gallery.<br>
<b><i>Manospondylus</i> redescovered?</b>- Disvovered in 1999 is BHI
6248 (nicknamed E.D. Cope). These remains were found in the Hell Creek
Formation of South Dakota, possibly at the site <i>Manospondylus</i>'
holotype was excavated from (based on centra piled up at the site).
This led Larson to propose it could be from the same individual.
Although Larson (in Anonymous, 2000a) suggested this could make <i>Manospondylus</i>
the valid name for <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, this could not happen. The
fourth edition of the ICZN dictates that <i>Manospondylus</i>, having
been considered invalid for fifty years, is a nomen oblitum which
cannot replace a valid name such as <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>. <br>
<b>Horner's 2000 Hell Creek Project</b>- Discovered in 2000 in the
Lower Hell Creek Formation of Montana, MOR 1125 (nicknamed B-rex)
became famous in 2005 when Schweitzer et al. described medullary bone
from its hindlimb elements. This tissue is unique to female birds among
extant animals and indicates the specimen was a female as well. It is
also unique among described <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> specimens in being
from the lower part of the Hell Creek Formation (Early Maastrichtian),
as opposed to others which are from the Late Maastrichtian. Of course
with so many undescribed specimens known, and so many specimens
collected by amatuers, it's possible other known Hell Creek <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>'
are equally old. For instance, the MOR website gives MOR 1131 the same
locality number as MOR 1125, and notes MOR 1126 and 1128 are also from
the Lower Hell Creek Formation.<br>
Another famous <i>T. rex</i> specimen was found in 2000, MOR 1126
(nicknamed C-rex or Celeste). Discovered in the Lower Hell Creek
Formation of Montana, this specimen is said to be ten percent larger
than FMNH PR2081 (Anonymous, 2000b) and have a tibiofemoral ratio of
1.0. However, Larson (2008a) lists neither femur nor tibia in the known
material. At 14 meters, this would be one of the largest <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
yet discovered, but this must be regarded as tentative until the
remains are prepared.<br>
Additional specimens discovered in the same field expedition as MOR
1125 and 1126 include MOR 1127 (nicknamed L-rex), MOR 1128 (nicknamed
G-rex), MOR 1131 (nicknamed J-rex) and MOR 1142 (nicknamed X-rex). MOR
1142 was originally thought to be a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, but turned
out to be an <i>Edmontosaurus</i>, hence its nickname.<br>
<b>Post-2000 discoveries</b>- MOR 1152 (nicknamed Frank or F-rex) is an
additional specimen known from the Lower Hell Creek Formation of
Montana. It was discovered in 2001.<br>
The USNM are preparing a specimen found in 2001, in the Hell Creek
Formation of Montana. It has been nicknamed Nathan or N-rex.<br>
In 2002, BHI 6230 (nicknamed Wyrex and later transferred to become HMNS
2006.1743.01) was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana.
This fairly complete specimen is notable for preserving third
metacarpal, the first radiale known from a <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, and
the first skin impressions from the genus (Larson, 2008a). The
impressions appear to be scaly and were described in detail by Bell et
al. (2017). As of 2004, many bones had been prepared. A website
containing numerous photographs of the specimen can be seen here- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210816160204/http://www.unearthingtrex.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20210816160204/http://www.unearthingtrex.com/</a>.<br>
Also in 2002, a specimen being prepared in the RMDRC (=AMNH 30564)
(nicknamed Sir William) was discovered in Montana. Originally
identified as a <i>T. rex</i> (Erickson et al., 2002; Kemmick, 2004),
the specimen was reidentified as a new taxon close to the ancestry of <i>T.
rex</i> by Stein and Triebold (2005). <br>
<b>How big was <i>T. rex</i> and which specimen is largest?</b> There
have been several contenders for the title of largest <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>-
MOR 008, UCMP 118742, FMNH 2081 (Sue), MOR 980 (Rigby rex or Peck's
rex) and MOR 1126 (Celeste or C-rex). Only FMNH 2081 is known from a
fairly complete skeleton, and only it has been extensively described
and illustrated in the technical literature (although MOR 008 and UCMP
118742 have both been mentioned in reviews of <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
morphology- e.g. Molnar, 1991; Currie, 2003; Carr, 2005). The mounted
skeleton of FMNH 2081 is 12.8 meters long, and less complete specimens
are scaled to it on this website. MOR 008's skull is stated to be 1.5
m, compared to FMNH 2081's 1.394 m. If the skeleton were in proportion,
it would be 13.8 meters long. However, the maxilla is only 84% as long,
with a toothrow 90% as long. The dentary is 87% as long with a toothrow
90% as long. These measurements suggest a total length of 10.8-11.5
meters. UCMP 118742's maxilla was said to be 29% longer than AMNH 5027
by Paul (1988), but is actually only 14% longer, with a toothrow 18%
longer (Larson, 2008b). If the skeleton were in proportion to FMNH
PR2081 (which has a 861 mm long maxilla and 645 mm toothrow), it would
be 12.1-12.4 meters long. MOR 980's mounted skeleton is said to be 12.8
meters long, although its pubis was reportedly 8% longer than FMNH
PR2081's. The skull as reconstructed for sale on its website is
slightly smaller than FMNH PR2081. Finally, no measurements have been
made for MOR 1126, merely Horner's estimate that it is 10% longer than
FMNH PR2801, which would make it 14.1 meters. One point which needs to
be made is that <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> individuals did not all have the
same proportions. For instance, FMNH PR2081's maxilla is 25% longer
than the holotype's. The scapula is 20% longer, the dentary 15% longer,
metatarsal IV 4% longer, the femur 3% longer, the sacrum 1% longer, the
tibiae are equal in length, and metatarsal II is actually 5% shorter.
This brings some perspective to the potentially confusing MOR 980
measurements noted above. It also suggests caution when estimating the
total length of fragmentary individuals. If only FMNH PR2081's maxilla
were known, we might suggest it was 25% larger than the holotype, or
15.5 meters! Yet it was &lt;5% larger, as the skeleton shows. So maybe
MOR 008 and UCMP 118742 had smaller bodies than their cranial remains
would suggest as well. As for MOR 1126, Horner's guess has little value
until measurements are taken.<br>
<b><i>Tyrannosaurus</i> defined</b>- Holtz (2001) defined
Tyrannosauridae as all taxa closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> than to <i>Aublysodon</i>,
as he advocated a basal group of tyrannosauroids (aublysodontids)
containing LACM 28471 (which he assigned to <i>Aublysodon</i>), OMNH
10131 and <i>Alectrosaurus</i> (a chimaera as used by Holtz).
Tyrannosauridae would then contain the taxa closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
than to this clade- <i>Gorgosaurus</i>, <i>Albertosaurus</i>, <i>Daspletosaurus</i>,
<i>Alioramus</i>, <i>Shanshanosaurus</i>, <i>Tarbosaurus</i> and <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
itself. However, LACM 28471 turned out to be a juvenile <i>T. rex</i>,
OMNH 10131 a juvenile <i>Bistahieversor</i>, and the <i>Aublysodon</i>'s
holotype (which Phylocode dictates the definition be based on) is
indeterminate. It is most likely a juvenile tyrannosaurine and may be <i>Daspletosaurus</i>
based on its age (see entry). The discovery of an apparent possible
ancestor of <i>T. rex</i> by Stein and Triebold (2005) in the same
formation as <i>Aublysodon</i>'s holotype means it may even belong to <i>T.
rex</i>'s sister species. Thus, of all tyrannosauroids, only <i>T. rex</i>
specimens themselves can be confirmed to be more closely related to the
<i>T. rex</i> holotype than to the <i>Aublysodon</i> holotype. This
makes Holtz's definition of Tyrannosauridae synonymous in known content
to <i>T. rex</i>.<br>
A similar situation occurs with Sereno's (1998) definition of
Tyrannosauridae, which was all taxa closer to <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>
than to <i>Aublysodon</i>, <i>Alectrosaurus</i> or <i>Nanotyrannus </i>(the
latter three again being 'aublysodontids' in Sereno's view). This case
is more explicit though, as <i>Nanotyrannus</i> is currently believed
to be a juvenile <i>T. rex</i> or a juvenile of its sister species. So
at best Sereno's Tyrannosauridae encompasses only <i>T. rex</i>
itself, and at worst it encompasses some unidentified population of <i>T.
rex</i> individuals more closely related to CMN 9380 than to CMN 7541.<br>
